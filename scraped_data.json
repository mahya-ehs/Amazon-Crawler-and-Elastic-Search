                "1": "It came in safe and all the wires i needed came with it, the controller as well. The ps5 itself is incredible, the graphics look amazing for such a tiny console, it’s easy to setup and sign into or create an account and the ps plus game pass thing is a good deal. I recommend this to anyone who wants to get a cheap and good console. God of War Ragnarok looks amazing btw",
                "2": "Very good as usual, quiet, planty of memory, running without any flaws.\nThis PS5 Slim is much better looking than regular PS5.\nThe box came a bit damaged but product was intact.",
                "3": "By pure accident, this arrived 8 years to the day after I bought my PS4.\n\n8 years is a pretty good run for a console, but I figured it was time to upgrade, and I've been quite pleased with the results.\n\nUp front, the bad: the slim has a bit more storage than the \"fat\" PS5 but I worry that I'll quickly run out of space. And that's it. That's the extent of my cons list.\n\nThe good: outrageously quicker load times. I've been playing a lot of Fallout 76. On my PS4, it would routinely take upwards of 45 seconds to \"fast\" travel. I got in the habit of grabbing the phone and scrolling social media while it loaded. On the PS5, it's more like 10 seconds, tops. Usually much less.\n\nI've also been playing the new(ish) God of War and load times are almost immediate. It's uncanny.\n\nI've got an older TV (probably 2012) and even still, the graphics are a significant step forward.\n\nUltimately, it's everything I loved about my PS4, except better. There's not a single area where I feel like they took a step back except in storage...I had a 1 TB Black Ops 3 edition and would have liked the PS5 to beat that without resorting to aftermarket help.\n\nOtherwise, the controller feels better in my hands and has some cool bells and whistles (integrated mic, multi-function giant button, etc.), the load times are vastly improved with the SSD, and the games look better and run better.",
                "4": "The devices work so good, is light and fast !",
                "5": "I could be wrong but I think the picture looks better than the old one. It’s a good buy if you don’t have one. The smaller one is OK. I had the older version and it’s noticeably smaller but not worth it if you own one. AS FOR COD MW3: Pay attention to your essential schedule. I’ve lost hours to his game because its just so good. It looks good and takes advantage of HDR. So many different available things to do but for sure activision is trying to figure out how to get their money out of you. A good bundle.",
                "6": "Everything good. The dual sense controller is awesome. Nice graphics and basically there's no load times while playing. Never had a playstation console before, ps5 is amazing. The spiderman 2 voucher code worked. I would like a better packaging, nothing happened luckyly.",
                "7": "Pros:\n\nRendimiento potente: La PlayStation 5 cuenta con un procesador AMD Zen 2 y una GPU AMD RDNA 2, lo que le permite ofrecer una experiencia de juego de última generación con gráficos impresionantes y tiempos de carga rápidos.\nCompatibilidad con versiones anteriores: La PlayStation 5 es compatible con la mayoría de los juegos de PlayStation 4, lo que le permite disfrutar de una biblioteca de juegos más amplia.\nControles DualSense: Los controles DualSense de la PlayStation 5 ofrecen una experiencia de juego más inmersiva gracias a las funciones de retroalimentación háptica y gatillos adaptativos.\nJuegos exclusivos de PlayStation: La PlayStation 5 ofrece una variedad de juegos exclusivos de alta calidad, como Marvel's Spider-Man 2, God of War: Ragnarok y Horizon Forbidden West.\nContras:\n\nPrecio elevado: La PlayStation 5 es una consola de gama alta, por lo que su precio puede ser elevado para algunos usuarios.\nEscasez: La PlayStation 5 ha sido difícil de encontrar desde su lanzamiento, debido a la escasez de componentes.\nConclusiones:\n\nLa PlayStation 5 es una consola de juegos de última generación que ofrece un rendimiento potente, una amplia biblioteca de juegos y una experiencia de juego inmersiva.

                "11": " I bought this console for my wife's birthday because she saw it at Costco. Fortunately, her birthday is around Black Friday so Amazon had it on somewhat of a sale with Spider-Man. Few days later, it got delivered but we had a one week trip to Spain planned and she didn't get to open it. Sad face. The whole trip she kept talking about how excited she was to get back and setup the console to play. I literally married a child. Fast forward one week, we get back and the first thing she does is set up the ps5. According to her, the setup process was fairly easy. One thing we noticed is that the screen reader is default set to on. This was a bit annoying when you didn't expect it to be defaulted to on. A quick google search showed us how to disable it. Game play is super duper smooth but you need to make sure your HDMI cable is up to date as we originally used one from 2010 so the resolution was stuck at 1080. Graphics have come such a long way from my Xbox 360 days. Spider-Man's story line is fun to play along to and quite challenging. Wife is super happy that she has the ps5 now but I'm worried we're going to be spending a lot of money on games now. But, you know what they say, happy wife... (and that's it)",
                "12": "The PS5 box was fresh, still had the little tape seal at the top, the Call of duty MW3 Voucher was in there and does work. The only thing I didn’t like was the Amazon box they put the PS5 box in didn’t have a lot of cushion to protect it, but I mean the PS5 box already protects the PS5 pretty well.\n\nI also would recommend putting very specific instructions on how to find your address as they accidentally delivered it to my neighbors even if you live in a house and not an apartment just something to better identify your home.",
                "13": "The whole bundle came as advertised a brand new slim 2023 ps5 model with the removable disc drive, none of the marketing or descriptions disclosed that so i wasnt sure if this was the first model of ps5 or the new slim model that you can attach a disc derive to and it is indeed the new model with a modular drive. Copy of Spiderman 2 came with it as well as a download code, thats y only real \"comlaint\" i wish it was a game case with a disc but you cant complain for the price of the bundle you get a new revised slim version of the ps5 and a new game with it, i love the feel of the ps5 controller its way better than the ps4 controller. Biggest thing i've noticed is the console is absolutly silent to the point i have forgotten it was even on because my PC fans on low are louder than it. Overall a great console and a great bundle if you've been waiting to upgrade from ps4 as i have, this is the time you should take that chance to upgrade and now i can take full advantage of my 120hz 4K moniter so all in all this was a perfect bundle to buy as an early christmas present for yourself or someone else who's wanted to upgrade to the next generation consoles."

                        "1": "Like that it holds games and charges remotes and keeps system cool",
                        "2": "This ps5 stand has a lot of cool features. I like the charging options for the controllers and the multiple extra USB ports it comes with. The cooling feature is very subtle but it does give off a slight breeze. I also like that my ps5 feels more sturdy standing up in the stand. Overall happy to have this product and would gift it to anyone with a ps5",
                        "3": "Very good quality item for the ps5 . The ps5 fit perfect in the slots and so controllers have a spot too and best part it charges . It took like 2 hours to fully charge . It is not noisy at all. The stand is very good and strong . Everything looks way neater than before . I haven’t found any cons with it .",
                        "4": "This was a convenient and organized space for myPS5 and controllers while ensuring charging capabilities… But I dont recommend plugging it into the playstation… I say use your own power supply. The cooling function is particularly essential, aiding in the prevention of overheating issues often associated with the PS5 by sucking it out form the bottom as oppose to blowing it into the device ( avoid blowing dust inside the playstation at all cost). It helps maintain proper airflow and reduces dust build-up, promoting better performance. This stand comes highly recommended due to its effective and compact design.\nDespite the impressive appearance and efficient fan operation that functions silently, a few drawbacks were noted by users. Charging the controllers can be a bit problematic, allowing only one controller to charge effectively when the PS5 is off. Even when powered by an outlet, it limits charging to one controller (this must be due to trying to avoid heat build up and killing the device and or they used very cheap parts inside), displaying an error message on the second one. This restriction hampers efficient charging, as it only permits charging both controllers if the PS5 remains turned on.\nThe cooling system design might be a cause for concern, as some users were uncertain about its effectiveness and found the single tiny fan to be insufficient, considering its size. The warning notices in the manual about potential overloading of USB ports raise questions regarding the compatibility of using additional ports for charging and cooling the console simultaneously. The constraints in the power source options, especially the limitation to power the base solely from the PlayStation, add to the uncertainty. The lack of clarity in the charging instructions further confuses the users, giving an impression of uncertainty and inadequate electronic protection.\nWhile the cooling station offers a neat setup, uncertainties surrounding its design, functionality, and charging limitations might make users hesitant to fully embrace it.",
                        "5": "In 30+ years of gaming, I've always been a horizontal guy, always thinking that I wasn't a fan of having them vertical. Either due to look, or just not trusting it wouldn't fall over (or be knocked over by me or someone else), but that has changed.\n\nI am still going to keep some consoles horizontal, but this little baby made me decide to keep my PS5 vertical. It honestly actually even looks better sitting that way. The extra storage for games and controllers is a very nice feature that I think anyone will find value in. However, what we all want to have these types of things for is to keep our PS5s cool.\n\nI'm aminly an RPG gamer. That is to say, I tend to spend a lot of time in long gaming sessions, once just an hour shy of a full day (that was for a charity challenge on twitch but meaning still stands). My consoles have in the past doubled as a space heater let's just say. Not with this baby. It was cool to the touch after a 9 hour session on NG+ of FF16 (great game). It also was cool the entire time I was downloading my very large ps4/ps5 digital library, along with some psplus stuff, which took about a day and a half (and majority of a 5tb external).\n\nBottom line, get this. If it can convert me to going vertical, and make sure I don't knock over or burn out my ps5, then it is worth the money.",
                        "6": "Tried everything imaginable and my ps5 does not fit into this product. Not willing to break a new gaming console to make it work.",
                        "7": "This cooling system works great, it helps keep the playstation 5 from over heating and charges the wireless controllers when they aren't in use.. Our playstation was in a fairly roomy shelving system, but we were concerned that it might overheat and cause issues with the interior components... since Playstations aren't cheap, this device will do a great job of cooling..\n\nNot only does it work great it looks really cool as well.. I know I'd recommend this set up anytime, especially if you care about keeping your system working for years to come.. These newer systems aren't really made with longevity in mind, and do tend to get really hot, having the ability to cool your system as you game is paramount in keeping it up and running..",
                        "8": "I wanted to like this product so bad. It helps with helping my house look organized. But after a while, it did not charge my controllers. I’ve had this product for about 2 months and it doesn’t hold a charge.",
                        "9": "I'm honestly not sure if it's helping with the cooling or not, but at the very least it is keeping controllers and things charged and organized nicely.",
                        "10": "This looks really nice keeping all the PS5 items close and organized. Fan works well and you can't even hear it running. My only issue is that when the power goes through the PS5 it only.charges when turned on. However when you power via an outlet it will only allow me.to charge on controller the other blinks as in error which is frustrating so basically you can only charge one controller at a time unless you leave the PS5 on just to charge the controllers."

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.",
                "2": "I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\n\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\n\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\n\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\n\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\n\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\n\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\n\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.",
                "3": "Always wanted to try VR but headsets were in the thousands of dollars the first many years. This thing comes along at just a few hundred dollars and can connect to your computer all the same to play the top games only limited by your own computer hardware. It’s wildly competitive!\n\nI rated this product 5 stars for perhaps the strangest reason I’ve had. After the first two weeks I barely touched this thing. It just sits gathering dust and I consider it a novelty. So why do I love it so much?\n\nThe experience that it provides is “of the future”. It made me laugh, giggle, and smile like a child in ways few products have. It ships with a free game that shows you everything VR can do in ~15 minutes and it was just so hilarious and impressive. That experience is so worth the full price even if it ends up on a shelf the week after.",

                "5": "This is an entry level VR headset and it's excellent for its price. I love it. There are quirks with it. Please mind that it was introduced to the market in late 2020 (so 3 years ago from this review) which is eons ago in tech space, so it's getting old, but I still love it.\n\nYes it's heavy, yes it works best when connected with a USB cable (for high FPS use), yes it's a little irritating to use generally because when in VR you have to interact with the world around you. So there's the learning curve. You need to invest time using this VR headset before submitting a review because things in VR are disorienting at the beginning -- think like the first time you used a trackball or a mouse.. took time to master.\n\nThat being said, I use it primarily for sim racing, it's comfortable, and it's absolutely incredible, so much that once you have the straps figured out properly and worked out the kinks, you can't tell it's even there. The sound that comes out of it is very immersive and good, the field of vision is excellent (I have one bad eye and I see 20/20 with the headset), I love the experience so much that I stopped using other sim racing games that don't support VR. I spend a lot of time on real race tracks in real life, and this VR headset allows me to spend time on the race track when it's raining out or when the season is over.\n\nBuy it, you won't regret it",
                "6": "I have absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this headset. It's fun and the fact that someone on my budget could afford it is really something. I wouldn't have had a VR set if it weren't for this being as affordable as it is. There are some shortcuts clearly taken to help keep it affordable but the actual VR hardware is amazing. Visuals are clear and immersive and it keeps up with my movements very well. If you don't have the money for something like an Index or Vive but want VR this is a great choice. It's also pretty sturdy. I've punched my table so hard my knuckles bled and the controller barely had a mark on it. You also can't tell I've headbutted my desk multiple times trying to pick up guns and rotwiener cores lol.\n\nLets get complaints out of the way first:\n• The original strap the headset came with is 100% the absolute worst part of the headset.\nDo yourself a favor and snag the Kiwi Design head strap while you're here on Amazon. The original strap squeezed the heck out of my head and if I loosened it the headset could flop around a bit causing blurry graphics and just being uncomfortable for a different reason. Due to that constant squeeze it gave me some nasty headaches usually after 2-3 hours of gameplay but sometimes much sooner and they could last the rest of the day. While they're nothing compared to a cluster headache for pain they were still what I'd consider bad.\n• Air link was awesome and worked great but was broken within a week of receiving the headset likely due to a patch (0.37 I think).\nI didn't get to enjoy it and the only potential bit of troubleshooting I have left to try as far as I've found is a factory reset which I'm reluctant to do. I bought a 3rd party link cable which is working well enough for me but I'd really like to be able to take my gaming to my living room where I have much less risk of punching or breaking anything and have some room to physically move around.\n• I don't really like having to be signed in with a Facebook account.\nI don't think this is going to change anytime soon if ever though.\n\nI've played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (H3VR), Blade & Sorcery, Pavlov, and Legendary Tales with my headset. I've played around 76 hours since I got it and aside from the headaches problem (which I've solved recently) it's been absolutely amazing and immersive. I've also used it to watch youtube, streaming shows, and movies. I absolutely love the thing for every use I've had for it so far. It's an absolute blast to experience actually fighting an opponent yourself whether it be that sniper in his tower or a bunch of knights. Just through the games themselves there's an amazing amount of stuff to experience but adding mods makes it even better. This headset can get your foot in the door to worlds you've always wanted to see in person at a pretty cheap price compared to it's competitors. Past video game levels, fantasy settings, all sorts of places to see and things to do.\n\nAn aspect you might have been thinking about is this is a great fitness tool even without dedicated fitness apps. Before you realize it you'll be sweaty and tired from swinging your arms, moving around, and holding your arms in front of you for surprisingly long periods of time. Pretty much anything you do with your VR will involve some level of activity and the gaming will almost certainly help kick your butt into shape. You should still visit the gym and make sure you're eating right though.\n\nI have only done gaming through PCVR and SteamVR. I have not tried any of the games for the headset on it's own nor do I expect to anytime soon. If you're looking for info on them then sorry but I can't help you with that.\n\nThere's several improvements I'd love to see either through future patches or future products. Probably the easiest would be the ability to verify and repair to latest patch the headset software from settings (if it's there I haven't found it). That way if my air link problem is software based I could fix it easily without having to do something like factory resetting the thing. If not then that's one more troubleshooting step I can cross off on my own fairly easily. In the next model or with an accessory if it's possible one thing I'd like is a second dedicated charge port allowing the use of a link cable and a charger with more oomph than a PC's USB 3 port would typically have for longer play times both at the same time. Another thing I'd like is a fabric cover. While the silicone cover is nice and stops the foam from irritating my face I'd love to have an official machine washable fabric facial interface cover that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.",
                "7": "I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I’d see if it was all I’d hoped it might be. Holy freakin’ crap!\n\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that’s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I’ve instructed it.\n\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I’m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I’m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I’m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn’t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\n\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I’ll be using like crazy.\n\nTonight I’m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it’s even better that I imagined. Best little toy I’ve bought myself in years.\n\nI did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing.

                "8": "This quest 2 is awesome. I bought my son one three years ago and he played with it daily. It just stopped working so I bought another.",
                "9": "Pros:\n- Fairly Immersive.\n- Amazing experiences.\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\n\nCons:\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.\n\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\n\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\n\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\n\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.",
                "10": "So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\n\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\n\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\n\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\n\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\n\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\n\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\n\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\n\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\n\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\n\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall."

                        "1": "Update: Six Weeks Later (Some Helpful Tips and Some Edits)\n\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\n\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\n\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else. But I pretty much never feel any discomfort at all.\n\nWhen adjusting the headset for the first time, the top strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be resting on your head. The most important adjustment is the headset arms because it determines how clear your vision will be. You want to adjust the the top strap and position of the headset interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. Then lastly, the back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I have mine pretty snug but there is no discomfort. For those who ever experience discomfort, it's probably because their headset arms are not at a good angle which causes all the pressure of the headset to be on the forehead which goes numb because of lack of blood flow.\n\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn't upgrade it, because I thought that it would make the headset lighter if they didn't upgrade it and I was worried about how heavy and uncomfortable the Quest 3 would be. But it's not at all heavy and it's very comfortable. Also, passthrough is everything to me now. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Eleven Table Tennis, and the Meta Quest Browser (for female hologram eye candy). Three is a free AR game called First Encounters that was fun to try and which I play on rare occasions. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\n\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\n\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have probably bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I want to keep installed for a while and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\n\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps like Virtual Desktop and Immersed when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general. I use it for when I am walking and indoor biking and sometimes when doing exercises like pushups and hamstring stretches.\n\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the Quest 3 wall charger and link cable that comes with the headset. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\n\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like only half an hour (or more).\n\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\n\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\n\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers since my router isn't that great.\n\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\n\nI like using Virtual Desktop for the virtual desktop. It's easy to grab and move the desktop around. It has a headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it lets you use your Quest controller to scroll and click on things. And it works in passthrough mode. I also like Immersed because you can have up to four virtual computer screens for free (five if you log in three times a week or pay for premium). Immersed allows you to be around other users and their avatars and it also has a passthrough mode. The only bad thing about Immersed is that it's not as easy to tilt and move the virtual desktop screens around, there is no headlock, and the Quest controllers are pretty much useless when interacting with the computer screens.\n\nZombie Games.... I started a game called Propagation: Paradise Hotel and it's a lot of fun and very interesting. Resident Evil 4 is also a good zombie VR game. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is a VR game or something but RE4 is fun to play. I like walking around the realistic setting. I like the scenery in RE4 better than the scenery in Arizona Sunshine and The Walking Dead. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners is also a decent zombie game. It's a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in TWD: S&S.\n\nOther Games.... I really liked the first Red Matter game. It was awesome. But sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value. I'm playing Red Matter 2, but so far I don't find it interesting. Genotype is a somewhat interesting game, but I feel like the texture resolutions aren't so great. Green Hell is an interesting realistic survival game so that is worth a try too. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game with crafting and you can even fish. I joined a Survival Nation server once and some guy came charging towards me and then started doing a lot of sign language, trying to get me to turn voice on, and trying to get me to complete 20 things at once so that I could be quickly caught up and start co-op'ng with him. That made me feel uncomfortable so then I started playing on solo mode. But after a while I got bored with solo mode. I want to be on the same server as other people but not feel pressured to co-op with them. I uninstalled it for now, but I might come back to it soon.\n\nFitness Games... I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\n\nCustom Launchers... I recommend getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher to help organize your games, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR games). (Increasing the resolution of games and your CPU/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, which isn't a problem for me since I am using an extension cord.) On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and the mirror that you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\n\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\n\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems. I mean some games are unbearably laggy and unplayable, but other games are playable. The important thing is that PCVR is an option for me and works most of the time, even though I have a weak laptop.\n\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 70% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people from trying the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much? I'm already looking forward to the Quest 4 because I hope it will have even better passthrough and better resolution.",
                        "2": "I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\n\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\n\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\n\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\n\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\n\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\n\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\n\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\n\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\n\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\n\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!",
                        "3": "Simply put I was blown away by the technology. The visuals are generally sharp and crisp and are pretty mind blowing. Even just navigating the menu screens is a joy, and the fact that it registers hand input is insane. The controllers feel good and snappy and intuitive.\n\nBut the apps just still aren't there overall. The selection of games is still just not quite there to justify this to 'everybody', and it is still far too hard to do simple things like play 3D movies or easily navigate the web to make this a must recommend. It is also still relatively heavy on the face (though improved from previous generations). The battery life is short at 2 hours but you probably won't want to play for that long anyway given the above. The pass through is.. passable but you won't be wanting to read any screens through it and it is definitely grainy. It is also unfathomable to me why they chose to ship this without a nasal piece to block the light coming in from the bottom.\n\nIn short, it's the best to come so far and this tech is definitely the future, but the technology still has quite a ways to go.",
                        "4": "First off, I'll say that i just got this and am still testing. But so far, I am super impressed. I own an original vive that I bought day 1 and then i got a reverb g2 that I have been using until the quest 3. Both if my previous headsets were corded, limited to one area of the house, and a pain to setup and use when I wanted to play. I was using light houses as well on the reverb g2 so that I could still use my better tracking vive wands. All of it was limiting and a pain which made me end up not playing. The Quest 3 was the solution I had been waiting for!\n\nBeing able to do room setup in headset quick and easy is a dream come true. I was skeptical about the wireless capability for pcvr as well but I am blown away at how well it has worked so far. I've been able to play pcvr games anywhere in my house which is amazing.\n\nThe pancake lenses are so much better than the fresnek lenses also. I wear glasses, and the quest 3 works well with my glasses out of the box, although I do want to get some lens inserts later.\n\nEverything seems very polished with a minimal amount of bugs. The AR pass through which it is somewhat grainy and not super clear, it's fun and works very well. The sound is pretty amazing also for the type do speakers it has.. Not enough bass in beatsaber and it can't compare to the g2 style of speakers but very impressive for what they are.\n\nControllers feel nice and not cheap, track well, battery life on the controllers is good. The headset itself looks and feels pretty good. I think they should have put a nose flap on it because the only place I have lightleak is at the bottom of the nose area. The strap of course is everyone's gripe.. Yes, it isn't great.. But tbh it isn't as uncomfortable as what everyone keeps saying to me. It works but it just isn't the best.\n\nMy one issue, aside from this being released by a company I don't like, is that they want to nickle and dime everyone for things that they should have included with the headset or to fix issues with the headset.\n\nThe headset battery life is about 2 hours. That isn't long... So they sell an overpriced better elite headstrap with an extra battery to extend it to 4 hours I think. Fixes two issues by making you pay more money. Fortunately, there are plenty of aftermarket options for battery extenders and straps that are cheaper, so you don't have to spend more money on meta's overpriced accessories.\n\nI've seen reports of people getting headsets with dead pixels and there being quality control issues... So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels.. Im a stickler for that stuff cause my vive had a dead pixel and it always bothered me. I'll be checking closely to make sure the quest 3 is good.\n\nI was going to take one star off for meta nickle and diming but the headset is so good that I won't do that as of now. This may change later but it's simply the best, most versatile, most polished VR headset you can get right now for this price. I guess they kept the price down by giving a crappy strap, smaller battery, etc.",
                        "5": "I bought the Quest 2 when it came out and was disappointed with the difficulty to maintain a good focus through both eyes, the wear on my face even after short-term use, the battery life, the overall performance (freezing, hitching , and delays while doing simple things was common), and the general lack of 3rd party support. The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don't accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn't randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!\n\nIt's still not perfect, and here's the bad so far:\n- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.\n- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you're really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn't ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.\n- I've heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I've played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there's still no dedicated app) with no issues.\n- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \"competitor\" platforms and services.\n- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it's clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn't normally a sudden change in color/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.\n- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.\n\nIf you're still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it's still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.",
                        "6": "I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.",
                        "7": "I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\n\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\n\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\n\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!",
                        "8": "I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\n\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \"rug burn\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone♡",
                        "9": "So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\n\n- The clarity of the new \"pancake\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\n\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\n\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\n\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\n\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\n\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\n\nThe comfort\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\n\nBattery life\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\n\nPCVR\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\n\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.",
                        "10": "Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\n\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR¹, thus far the native apps aren’t of interest] and didn’t use it as much as I’d expected.² With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I’ve ZERO regrets.\n\n😺 Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\n\n😻 Lenses: WOW!\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2’s Fresnel lenses and the Q3’s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the “sweet-spot” is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\n\n😺 Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I’m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\n\n😿 Contrast: comparable\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\n\n😻 Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. 😬😬😬😬\n\n😻 IPD settings: significantly improved\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\n\n😐 Controllers: neutral\nI liked the rings on the Q2’s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3’s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\n\nThings I’ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I’ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\n• battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n• sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n• eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\n• native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\n\nOverall: while I’m sad there weren’t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it’s a still terrific bargain. It’s a shame about the contrast though 😹\n\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn’t have wifi enabled and couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\n_____\n¹ — For PCVR I’m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta’s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I’ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I’ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop’s “HVEC 10-bit” encoder, which graphically is better than the plain “HVEC” encoder, also has a lower latency!]\n\n² — Considering the price I paid vis-à-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset."

                "1": "I have been a gammer all my life, have owned almost every console since the Atari Pong all the way till the Ps4 and Switch, but I have skipped most Xbox' s except for the original that was given to me as a gift.\nThis new console that Microsoft has made is in my opinion the absolute best in this generation. Spec-wise it cannot be beat and if superior to the PS5 I most respects. But when you use your series X and in conjunction with Game Pass Ultimate (GPU), it simply becomes the hands down, no questions asked, absolute BEST VALUE in gaming anywhere! Today Microsoft has also teamed up their GPU service with EA, and now we can get most sports games and most EA titles included in GPU. But you must also add the future inclusion of Bethesda and all their amazing titles from day one in GUP since MS has bought them out.\nSo how can't you go wrong with the MOST POWERFUL CONSOLE EVER MADE and the potential of including GPU to make it the best value in gaming PERIOD.\n\nYes some will think that their are few titles specifically made for this new generation as of this writing, but the same goes for Playstation, and Sony changed their mind in the short term, as most titles that they have as great exclusives are also being released for the foreseeable future on PS4 as well as PS5.\n\nPROS:\n- Best Value in gaming when used with Game Pass Ultimate.\n- Most powerful console ever made (12TFLOPS - 52 CU's).\n- Intuitive and very functional OS.\n- Great games even for this generation like: Medium.\n- FPS Boos feature for older games.\n- Automatic HDR for older games.\n- Instant Resume feature is just awesome!\n- Great controls, I thought I would not like them, BUT THEY ARE GREAT!\n- Minimalistic design, that goes well with anything you have already.\n- QUIET there is no noticeable sound of fans even when gaming for hours.\n- More available space in internal drive then PS5.\n\nCONS:\n- Controllers use a AA Battery... WHY would you do this in 2021? Yes there are options, but I should not need to look for options, personally for now I went the rechargeable Energizer route, but it is a hassle that should not be present in a console this generation.\n- No gimmicks and straightforward pure power, no you don't get resistance in the adaptive triggers like a PS5, makes it feel a bit less futuristic.\n- Had a bug happen to me more then once while purchasing new games, got an error, so for workaround had to add to cart, go to billing address, put edit, select the same billing address and then it worked, very annoying.\n\nSPECS:\n- Processor: 8-core AMD Ryzen Zen 2-architecture CPU at 3.8GHz (3.6GHz with SMT)\n- Graphics: AMD Navi/RDNA 2-family GPU with 52 CU at 1.825GHz (12TFLOPS FP32)\n- Video:16GB GDDR6 with 14Gbps 320-bit interface (10GB at 560GB/s allocated to GPU, 6GB at 336GB/s allocated to rest of system with 3.5GB for GPU)\n- Die Size: 360.45 mm2\n- Process: 7nm Enhanced\n- Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w/ 320mb bus\n- Memory Bandwidth: 10 GB @ 560 GB/s, 6GB @ 336 GB/s\n- Internal Storage: 1 TB Custom NVME SSD\n- I/O Throughput: 2.4 GB/s (Raw), 4.8 GB/s (Compressed, with custom hardware decompression block)\n- Expandable Storage: 1 TB Expansion Card - Seagate ATM only avail.\n- External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD - WB Black Gaming 5TB what I got for it.\n- Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive-\n- Performance: 4K @ 60 FPS, up to 4K @ 120 FPS, 8K @ 60 FPS\n- Size: 301mm x 151mm x 151mm\n\nFinally, I will recommend this console over the the PS5, its simply a BEAST and a better value when teamed with GPU. I won't get a Ps5 for the foreseeable future at least not till late 2022, since by then they might really have PS5 exclusives that don't get. a PS4 version.\nThe Xbox Series X is such a great console that you would be hard pressed to look it over over the hype that the Ps5 has generated because of its lack of availability. So if you like simply the best console this generation and wish to get the best bang for your buck, Xbox Series X simply rocks.\n\nPRO+ : The Xbox series X is also an amazing emulation system, it can run Retroarch with no hacks, with nothing weird, just look it up in YouTube and you will find tutorials. But it can do emulation like very few systems and it add to its tremendous lineup and value.\n\nGreat job Microsoft, you not only added a customer, but a new fan.",
                "2": "Step into the realm of gaming greatness with the Xbox Series X, the Hercules of consoles – muscular, powerful, and ready to elevate your gaming experience to celestial heights! Assembling this gaming marvel was simpler than beating level one of a classic arcade game. Unbox, plug in, power up, and voila! I was transported into a world of immersive gaming splendor.\n\nLet's talk power, folks! With a whopping 1TB SSD, it's like having a storage vault for every gaming adventure imaginable. The 16GB RAM felt like having a brain that processes game data quicker than a cheetah chasing its prey. The console revved up like a finely tuned sports car, promising gaming speeds faster than my cat chasing a laser pointer.\n\nThe promise of true 4K gaming sent shivers down my spine. The graphics were so sharp, I could almost see the pixels having a party! And with up to 120 frames per second, it's like watching a movie in fast-forward, only it's your gameplay and not a rom-com.\n\nThe Wireless Controller is like an extension of your own hand – sleek, comfortable, and responsive. It's like having a magic wand (minus the spells, but hey, your gaming skills might feel magical).\n\nThe Velocity Architecture? It's like having a gaming time machine, reducing loading times to mere blips on the screen. I blinked, and suddenly, I was in the midst of epic battles without the agony of waiting.\n\nHowever, even this gaming behemoth has its kryptonite. The only downside? The wallet might feel a bit lighter after acquiring this gaming beast. But fear not, for the hours of gaming joy it provides will make you forget about those dollar signs faster than a high-speed race in Forza Horizon.\n\nNow, maneuverability? Let's be real – this console isn't going anywhere. It's like a monolith, firmly rooted in your gaming universe. But who needs maneuverability when you're anchored in a realm of gaming nirvana?\n\nIn conclusion, the Xbox Series X is a titan among gaming consoles, a symphony of power, graphics, and sheer gaming delight. It's a gaming paradise that turns button-mashing into a delightful symphony of pixels. So, grab this console, embrace your inner gaming legend, and embark on gaming adventures that'll leave you shouting \"Achievement Unlocked!\" like a boss!",
                "3": "I bought this for Christmas for my son and we love it. It’s very user friendly and the graphics are wonderful. The package it came in was fun and very professional! Downloading disc games can take a while sometimes, but the system is fantastic! I absolutely adore the backwards compatibility!!! Absolute favorite feature for sure! This was the main selling point for me when I was looking into a new console to buy. I didn’t see the point in buying a PS5 if I couldn’t play the PS3 games that I currently have from my older system. At least with the Xbox series X I can still play the 360 games that I have and even buy more 360 games if I want! The memory is outstanding as well! Xbox also has a family settings app so I can keep up with the games my son is playing and how much time he logs on his system, as well as any messages from “friends.” Definitely worth the money in my opinion. Family friendly. User friendly. Just amazing. Keep up the good work Xbox!",
                "4": "Xbox Series X! The graphics are amazing, and it runs games smoothly. The quick load times are a game-changer, and the Game Pass library is a fantastic value. The library of games if compared to previous generations has been slightly disappointing but are starting to pick up. Xbox exclusive titles are great along with backward compatibility (select Xbox, 360, One games) provides a wide range of gaming options. However, the console's large size might be a concern for some users as I did not have any room on my current tv stand. Overall, it's a top-tier gaming system for both casual and hardcore gamers.",
                "5": "I love this console. Between the full backwards compatibility, the semi compact size, and the amazing performance, it's a great bang for buck! Much more performance than a similarly priced PC. Everything is smooth. Really worth the upgrade from an Xbox one.",
                "6": "Been wanting to upgrade my Xbox since this was announced. Finally was able to. Already opened up a couple games and was NOT expecting for them to load SO fast and to look SO clear and beautiful! So happy with this purchase!",
                "7": "Very simple to set up and transfer from an Xbox One and felt the difference between next-gen. It's very helpful in showing what your setup can and can't do. At $399.99, the Series X is worth it.",
                "8": "This here Xbox Series X console, is the best of the best!!!! High speed power, 120 FPS, gaming power to the max!!!! Such a great purchase, I will purchase again in the near future for accessories!! Thank you Amazon for your amazing support on this product. I couldn’t thank you enough for the support.",
                "9": "Delivery was fast, 2 days. Box was well packaged, sealed Xbox x.\nSet up was simple, even for me. You just use your phone to set it up. I had a quick issue where the code that was sent wasn’t working, so wasn’t sure if it was the code, or something incorrect with my email/password. At that point, the Xbox wouldn’t let me power off using the controller, so I manually turned it off, waited a couple minutes, started again, restarted the “new console” set up, new code that worked, and before I knew it, I was at the Home Screen.\nNo noticeable cosmetic or technical issues. This is definitely a nice upgrade from Xbox one.\nLove premium game pass, and the user interface is similar to Xbox one. Controller provided takes double A’s, so will buy another one with a bit more quality without dealing with batteries.\nI used the disc drive, it works which is great, my old Xbox one blue Ray drive stopped working a couple years ago.\nI will give an update after more use and game play, but initially, very happy to have this. I’ve held out a long time for one of these! Worth the wait!\nUPDATE: Xbox X is great. Blu-ray drive works, love the quick resume option for games. Format is familiar like Xbox One, so not a lot of changes on the Home Screen and such. No issues playing games, watching movies, etc. very much like having this. Fun for everyone! Graphic updates are nice, however, if your using an older TV you prob won’t see too much difference. Highly recommend if your still on the fence about purchasing.",
                "10": "So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box? Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.\n\nYou open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it's in a treasure chest. It was great! I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console. So good job on that!\n\nI'm upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade. I've got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it! I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.\n\nAnd here it is.\n\nVisually speaking, I'm not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S. There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren't there before. Everything is less fuzzy. So that's good. It's just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES. Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2. But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One. The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me. I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I'm playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.\n\nAnd that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games. While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn't anything on the Xbox that can't be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility). With Halo Infinite being delayed, there's no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.\n\nWell... I SAY that but I also don't regret doing so. I'm disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice. And it isn't even the best part of the Series X. That would be the load times. With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast. I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done. This thing zips along. That also applies while you're in the game. Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly. There's a lot of power in this rectangular box. The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it's not a selling feature if you're comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.\n\nIt's a lot of the \"under-the-hood\" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One. The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox's back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you'll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren't brand new exclusives. I've got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now. If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service. I spent my first day just downloading everything I'm going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.\n\nAnd, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass. You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X. It's a good deal.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase. I wish Halo would have made launch. I'm also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it's worth playing. But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable. In the end, it comes down to where your friends are. Mine are on Xbox so here I am. This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I'm going to regret having it a year or so down the line.\n\nBut if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don't really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season. Miles Morales looks really good.\n\nBut if Sony's exclusives don't move you, the third party games are all multiplatform. You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin's Creeds on whatever console you manage to get. In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there's enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.\n\nOh! This thing also has a controller! It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller. This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version. There's a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch. So Microsoft is a little behind but it's here now! I have not used it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it.\n\nAnyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware. This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time. Day one, you know what you're getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.\n\nBut, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)"

                "1": "Update: Six Weeks Later (Some Helpful Tips and Some Edits)\n\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\n\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\n\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else. But I pretty much never feel any discomfort at all.\n\nWhen adjusting the headset for the first time, the top strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be resting on your head. The most important adjustment is the headset arms because it determines how clear your vision will be. You want to adjust the the top strap and position of the headset interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. Then lastly, the back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I have mine pretty snug but there is no discomfort. For those who ever experience discomfort, it's probably because their headset arms are not at a good angle which causes all the pressure of the headset to be on the forehead which goes numb because of lack of blood flow.\n\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn't upgrade it, because I thought that it would make the headset lighter if they didn't upgrade it and I was worried about how heavy and uncomfortable the Quest 3 would be. But it's not at all heavy and it's very comfortable. Also, passthrough is everything to me now. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Eleven Table Tennis, and the Meta Quest Browser (for female hologram eye candy). Three is a free AR game called First Encounters that was fun to try and which I play on rare occasions. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\n\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\n\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have probably bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I want to keep installed for a while and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\n\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps like Virtual Desktop and Immersed when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general. I use it for when I am walking and indoor biking and sometimes when doing exercises like pushups and hamstring stretches.\n\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the Quest 3 wall charger and link cable that comes with the headset. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\n\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like only half an hour (or more).\n\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\n\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\n\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers since my router isn't that great.\n\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\n\nI like using Virtual Desktop for the virtual desktop. It's easy to grab and move the desktop around. It has a headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it lets you use your Quest controller to scroll and click on things. And it works in passthrough mode. I also like Immersed because you can have up to four virtual computer screens for free (five if you log in three times a week or pay for premium). Immersed allows you to be around other users and their avatars and it also has a passthrough mode. The only bad thing about Immersed is that it's not as easy to tilt and move the virtual desktop screens around, there is no headlock, and the Quest controllers are pretty much useless when interacting with the computer screens.\n\nZombie Games.... I started a game called Propagation: Paradise Hotel and it's a lot of fun and very interesting. Resident Evil 4 is also a good zombie VR game. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is a VR game or something but RE4 is fun to play. I like walking around the realistic setting. I like the scenery in RE4 better than the scenery in Arizona Sunshine and The Walking Dead. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners is also a decent zombie game. It's a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in TWD: S&S.\n\nOther Games.... I really liked the first Red Matter game. It was awesome. But sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value. I'm playing Red Matter 2, but so far I don't find it interesting. Genotype is a somewhat interesting game, but I feel like the texture resolutions aren't so great. Green Hell is an interesting realistic survival game so that is worth a try too. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game with crafting and you can even fish. I joined a Survival Nation server once and some guy came charging towards me and then started doing a lot of sign language, trying to get me to turn voice on, and trying to get me to complete 20 things at once so that I could be quickly caught up and start co-op'ng with him. That made me feel uncomfortable so then I started playing on solo mode. But after a while I got bored with solo mode. I want to be on the same server as other people but not feel pressured to co-op with them. I uninstalled it for now, but I might come back to it soon.\n\nFitness Games... I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\n\nCustom Launchers... I recommend getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher to help organize your games, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR games). (Increasing the resolution of games and your CPU/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, which isn't a problem for me since I am using an extension cord.) On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and the mirror that you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\n\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\n\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems. I mean some games are unbearably laggy and unplayable, but other games are playable. The important thing is that PCVR is an option for me and works most of the time, even though I have a weak laptop.\n\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 70% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people from trying the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much? I'm already looking forward to the Quest 4 because I hope it will have even better passthrough and better resolution.",
                "2": "I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\n\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\n\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\n\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\n\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\n\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\n\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\n\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\n\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\n\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\n\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!",
                "3": "Simply put I was blown away by the technology. The visuals are generally sharp and crisp and are pretty mind blowing. Even just navigating the menu screens is a joy, and the fact that it registers hand input is insane. The controllers feel good and snappy and intuitive.\n\nBut the apps just still aren't there overall. The selection of games is still just not quite there to justify this to 'everybody', and it is still far too hard to do simple things like play 3D movies or easily navigate the web to make this a must recommend. It is also still relatively heavy on the face (though improved from previous generations). The battery life is short at 2 hours but you probably won't want to play for that long anyway given the above. The pass through is.. passable but you won't be wanting to read any screens through it and it is definitely grainy. It is also unfathomable to me why they chose to ship this without a nasal piece to block the light coming in from the bottom.\n\nIn short, it's the best to come so far and this tech is definitely the future, but the technology still has quite a ways to go.",
                "4": "First off, I'll say that i just got this and am still testing. But so far, I am super impressed. I own an original vive that I bought day 1 and then i got a reverb g2 that I have been using until the quest 3. Both if my previous headsets were corded, limited to one area of the house, and a pain to setup and use when I wanted to play. I was using light houses as well on the reverb g2 so that I could still use my better tracking vive wands. All of it was limiting and a pain which made me end up not playing. The Quest 3 was the solution I had been waiting for!\n\nBeing able to do room setup in headset quick and easy is a dream come true. I was skeptical about the wireless capability for pcvr as well but I am blown away at how well it has worked so far. I've been able to play pcvr games anywhere in my house which is amazing.\n\nThe pancake lenses are so much better than the fresnek lenses also. I wear glasses, and the quest 3 works well with my glasses out of the box, although I do want to get some lens inserts later.\n\nEverything seems very polished with a minimal amount of bugs. The AR pass through which it is somewhat grainy and not super clear, it's fun and works very well. The sound is pretty amazing also for the type do speakers it has.. Not enough bass in beatsaber and it can't compare to the g2 style of speakers but very impressive for what they are.\n\nControllers feel nice and not cheap, track well, battery life on the controllers is good. The headset itself looks and feels pretty good. I think they should have put a nose flap on it because the only place I have lightleak is at the bottom of the nose area. The strap of course is everyone's gripe.. Yes, it isn't great.. But tbh it isn't as uncomfortable as what everyone keeps saying to me. It works but it just isn't the best.\n\nMy one issue, aside from this being released by a company I don't like, is that they want to nickle and dime everyone for things that they should have included with the headset or to fix issues with the headset.\n\nThe headset battery life is about 2 hours. That isn't long... So they sell an overpriced better elite headstrap with an extra battery to extend it to 4 hours I think. Fixes two issues by making you pay more money. Fortunately, there are plenty of aftermarket options for battery extenders and straps that are cheaper, so you don't have to spend more money on meta's overpriced accessories.\n\nI've seen reports of people getting headsets with dead pixels and there being quality control issues... So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels.. Im a stickler for that stuff cause my vive had a dead pixel and it always bothered me. I'll be checking closely to make sure the quest 3 is good.\n\nI was going to take one star off for meta nickle and diming but the headset is so good that I won't do that as of now. This may change later but it's simply the best, most versatile, most polished VR headset you can get right now for this price. I guess they kept the price down by giving a crappy strap, smaller battery, etc.",
                "5": "I bought the Quest 2 when it came out and was disappointed with the difficulty to maintain a good focus through both eyes, the wear on my face even after short-term use, the battery life, the overall performance (freezing, hitching , and delays while doing simple things was common), and the general lack of 3rd party support. The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don't accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn't randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!\n\nIt's still not perfect, and here's the bad so far:\n- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.\n- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you're really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn't ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.\n- I've heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I've played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there's still no dedicated app) with no issues.\n- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \"competitor\" platforms and services.\n- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it's clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn't normally a sudden change in color/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.\n- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.\n\nIf you're still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it's still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.",
                "6": "I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.",
                "7": "I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\n\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\n\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\n\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!",
                "8": "I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\n\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \"rug burn\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone♡",
                "9": "So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\n\n- The clarity of the new \"pancake\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\n\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\n\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\n\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\n\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\n\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\n\nThe comfort\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\n\nBattery life\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\n\nPCVR\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\n\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.",
                "10": "Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\n\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR¹, thus far the native apps aren’t of interest] and didn’t use it as much as I’d expected.² With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I’ve ZERO regrets.\n\n😺 Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\n\n😻 Lenses: WOW!\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2’s Fresnel lenses and the Q3’s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the “sweet-spot” is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\n\n😺 Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I’m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\n\n😿 Contrast: comparable\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\n\n😻 Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. 😬😬😬😬\n\n😻 IPD settings: significantly improved\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\n\n😐 Controllers: neutral\nI liked the rings on the Q2’s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3’s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\n\nThings I’ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I’ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\n• battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n• sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n• eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\n• native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\n\nOverall: while I’m sad there weren’t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it’s a still terrific bargain. It’s a shame about the contrast though 😹\n\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn’t have wifi enabled and couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\n_____\n¹ — For PCVR I’m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta’s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I’ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I’ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop’s “HVEC 10-bit” encoder, which graphically is better than the plain “HVEC” encoder, also has a lower latency!]\n\n² — Considering the price I paid vis-à-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset."

                        "1": "First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.",
                        "2": "I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\n\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\n\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\n\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\n\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\n\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\n\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\n\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.",
                        "3": "Always wanted to try VR but headsets were in the thousands of dollars the first many years. This thing comes along at just a few hundred dollars and can connect to your computer all the same to play the top games only limited by your own computer hardware. It’s wildly competitive!\n\nI rated this product 5 stars for perhaps the strangest reason I’ve had. After the first two weeks I barely touched this thing. It just sits gathering dust and I consider it a novelty. So why do I love it so much?\n\nThe experience that it provides is “of the future”. It made me laugh, giggle, and smile like a child in ways few products have. It ships with a free game that shows you everything VR can do in ~15 minutes and it was just so hilarious and impressive. That experience is so worth the full price even if it ends up on a shelf the week after.",

                        "5": "This is an entry level VR headset and it's excellent for its price. I love it. There are quirks with it. Please mind that it was introduced to the market in late 2020 (so 3 years ago from this review) which is eons ago in tech space, so it's getting old, but I still love it.\n\nYes it's heavy, yes it works best when connected with a USB cable (for high FPS use), yes it's a little irritating to use generally because when in VR you have to interact with the world around you. So there's the learning curve. You need to invest time using this VR headset before submitting a review because things in VR are disorienting at the beginning -- think like the first time you used a trackball or a mouse.. took time to master.\n\nThat being said, I use it primarily for sim racing, it's comfortable, and it's absolutely incredible, so much that once you have the straps figured out properly and worked out the kinks, you can't tell it's even there. The sound that comes out of it is very immersive and good, the field of vision is excellent (I have one bad eye and I see 20/20 with the headset), I love the experience so much that I stopped using other sim racing games that don't support VR. I spend a lot of time on real race tracks in real life, and this VR headset allows me to spend time on the race track when it's raining out or when the season is over.\n\nBuy it, you won't regret it",
                        "6": "I have absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this headset. It's fun and the fact that someone on my budget could afford it is really something. I wouldn't have had a VR set if it weren't for this being as affordable as it is. There are some shortcuts clearly taken to help keep it affordable but the actual VR hardware is amazing. Visuals are clear and immersive and it keeps up with my movements very well. If you don't have the money for something like an Index or Vive but want VR this is a great choice. It's also pretty sturdy. I've punched my table so hard my knuckles bled and the controller barely had a mark on it. You also can't tell I've headbutted my desk multiple times trying to pick up guns and rotwiener cores lol.\n\nLets get complaints out of the way first:\n• The original strap the headset came with is 100% the absolute worst part of the headset.\nDo yourself a favor and snag the Kiwi Design head strap while you're here on Amazon. The original strap squeezed the heck out of my head and if I loosened it the headset could flop around a bit causing blurry graphics and just being uncomfortable for a different reason. Due to that constant squeeze it gave me some nasty headaches usually after 2-3 hours of gameplay but sometimes much sooner and they could last the rest of the day. While they're nothing compared to a cluster headache for pain they were still what I'd consider bad.\n• Air link was awesome and worked great but was broken within a week of receiving the headset likely due to a patch (0.37 I think).\nI didn't get to enjoy it and the only potential bit of troubleshooting I have left to try as far as I've found is a factory reset which I'm reluctant to do. I bought a 3rd party link cable which is working well enough for me but I'd really like to be able to take my gaming to my living room where I have much less risk of punching or breaking anything and have some room to physically move around.\n• I don't really like having to be signed in with a Facebook account.\nI don't think this is going to change anytime soon if ever though.\n\nI've played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (H3VR), Blade & Sorcery, Pavlov, and Legendary Tales with my headset. I've played around 76 hours since I got it and aside from the headaches problem (which I've solved recently) it's been absolutely amazing and immersive. I've also used it to watch youtube, streaming shows, and movies. I absolutely love the thing for every use I've had for it so far. It's an absolute blast to experience actually fighting an opponent yourself whether it be that sniper in his tower or a bunch of knights. Just through the games themselves there's an amazing amount of stuff to experience but adding mods makes it even better. This headset can get your foot in the door to worlds you've always wanted to see in person at a pretty cheap price compared to it's competitors. Past video game levels, fantasy settings, all sorts of places to see and things to do.\n\nAn aspect you might have been thinking about is this is a great fitness tool even without dedicated fitness apps. Before you realize it you'll be sweaty and tired from swinging your arms, moving around, and holding your arms in front of you for surprisingly long periods of time. Pretty much anything you do with your VR will involve some level of activity and the gaming will almost certainly help kick your butt into shape. You should still visit the gym and make sure you're eating right though.\n\nI have only done gaming through PCVR and SteamVR. I have not tried any of the games for the headset on it's own nor do I expect to anytime soon. If you're looking for info on them then sorry but I can't help you with that.\n\nThere's several improvements I'd love to see either through future patches or future products. Probably the easiest would be the ability to verify and repair to latest patch the headset software from settings (if it's there I haven't found it). That way if my air link problem is software based I could fix it easily without having to do something like factory resetting the thing. If not then that's one more troubleshooting step I can cross off on my own fairly easily. In the next model or with an accessory if it's possible one thing I'd like is a second dedicated charge port allowing the use of a link cable and a charger with more oomph than a PC's USB 3 port would typically have for longer play times both at the same time. Another thing I'd like is a fabric cover. While the silicone cover is nice and stops the foam from irritating my face I'd love to have an official machine washable fabric facial interface cover that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.",
                        "7": "I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I’d see if it was all I’d hoped it might be. Holy freakin’ crap!\n\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that’s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I’ve instructed it.\n\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I’m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I’m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I’m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn’t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\n\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I’ll be using like crazy.\n\nTonight I’m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it’s even better that I imagined.

Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\n\nCons:\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.\n\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\n\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\n\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\n\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.",
                        "10": "So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\n\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\n\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\n\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\n\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\n\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\n\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\n\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\n\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\n\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\n\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall."

                        "1": "This is an excellent case for your new Nintendo Switch. I ordered it the day it was put on Amazon for an amazingly low price, so I did not have high expectations, but I am happily surprised at the high quality of this case. The case is hard enough to fully protect your Nintendo Switch, yet flexible enough to fit in bags and carry everywhere with you. The case has nice little rubber handle and zips shut. There is no zipper on the inside of the case.\n\nInside you will find it is lined with a soft microfiber. There is a mesh pocket on the top that goes about 3/4 of the way up and holds a ton of stuff. The bottom of the case has a double sided flap. The top holds 8 cartridges and the bottom is padded to fully protect your Nintendo switch screen. The bottom of the case is form molded to hold your Nintendo Switch perfectly and even has loose fitting elastic on each side to help secure it in place. I originally bought the officially licensed Tough Pouch, but much prefer this one. They are almost identical in size and appear to be made about the same way. The pouch is a fraction thinner and does not have a handle. It has almost the same inside except not as useful. The flap that protects the screen is sewn at the top and does not fully protect the screen on the touch pouch, where this one is on the bottom and fully protects the screen. The Orzly case holds 8 games and accessories and the tough pouch only holds the switch and 5 cartridges. Another thing I love about this case is that it is simple and black. There is no advertising on it anywhere and no way for thieves to know you are carrying an brand new Video Game Console.\n\nPlease see photos for more details and please excuse the crappy screen protector I have on the Switch in these pics. The 5th picture shows the Orzly pouch on top and the Tough Pouch on the bottom for size comparison.\n\nHighlights:\n* Holds 8 cartridges or micro SD cards\n* Large Mesh Pouch can hold all cords, chargers, or an accessory. I even fit 2 entire game cases in the pouch!\n* Large soft screen protector sewn into case.\n* Handle for carrying the case.\n* Lightweight, yet strong and durable.\n* The Soft, microfiber interior protects your console and controllers from everyday wear and tear, bumps and scrapes.\n\nThis case is well worth the $25 it retails for and the case I compared it to is currently selling for $40! Only issue I had was that it was sent in a bubble mailer, so the outside box was crushed. This would be a problem if it were a gift, but it did not affect the actual product in any way.",
                        "2": "After spending big bucks on my Granddaughters Nintendo Switch I realized “Holy Cow” I bought nothing to protect it!! She is only 8 and walks around with it and uses it in the car. When I drop my cell phone I am always glad I have a case! I immediately ordered this one and it’s perfect, a safe place for everything and a sturdy handle for on the go! Not expensive and she always uses it!",
                        "3": "When I'm spending the weekend out of town, I use a nice, big carrying case the can hold the whole system set up. That's great for a whole weekend, but when I'm going to be stuck someplace boring for an evening or just a few hours, now I can take what I need to stave off boredom without having to carry everything I own. This case is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about breaking anything and roomy enough to hold extra controllers, cords, games, or anything else I can't live without. And it still fits in my purse. Great product!",
                        "4": "Overall the product is great. However, one of the complaints I have is that whenever you try to put in the Joy Con Grip in the case, the cause becomes extremely bulky, and it causes me to worry that if ever drop the case that it might crack my switch's screen. Also, obviously you can't put an elite controller in the case which sucks because you either need a separate bag or you have to carry it in your hand. Otherwise the case is EXTREMELY good, the bands that hold the switch is great, the pockets that hold small accessories are amazing (it can hold the charger and extra joy cons), and the zipper & sturdiness of the case is phenomenal. Therefore, I would highly recommend getting this case even if it is on the pricier side.",
                        "5": "This carrier for the Nintendo Switch is really nice. It holds everything it needs and honestly, the quality is great. For as many times as this thing gets opened, the zipper appears to be holding strong. I'm happy with this purchase.",
                        "6": "Fits switch perfectly and it’s accessories. Good, sturdy case",
                        "7": "I wanted something I could bring my switch with me on travel, Just drop it in my bag and forget about it. So far I've used this case on a couple of trips and it's been great. It's not too bulky, but it does its job well. Plenty of room to store a charger or whatever you would like.",
                        "8": "This case is durable and holds my switch plus a variety of different games and other msc items.",
                        "9": "Love using this case for traveling with my switch. It can hold many games as well. Strongly recommend if you’re looking to get a traveling case for your switch!!",
                        "10": "Es plastico duro y se ve muy duradero, perfecto para su uso.",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family's favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.\n\nGameplay:\nFrom the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey's Cappy or Mario Sunshine's FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don't need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren't quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.\n\nGraphics:\nGraphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.\n\nControls:\nThe controls, for the most part, are what you'd expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn't notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.\n\nCo-op:\nThe co-op mode is where \"Super Mario Wonder\" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don't receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.\n\nOverall Assessment:\nSuper Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I'll update as we continue our adventure...",
                "2": "Introduction:\nAs a self-proclaimed cool dad with a lifelong love for video games, I was excited to dive into the Mario Wonder Switch Game. Mario has been a part of my gaming journey since I was a kid, and I couldn't wait to see what this new title had to offer. In this in-depth review, I'll share my insights and experiences playing the game from a cool dad's perspective.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics:\nThe gameplay of Mario Wonder Switch is nothing short of magical. It captures the classic Mario charm while introducing innovative mechanics. The variety of power-ups, from the Super Mushroom to the new Wonder Suit, adds a layer of fun and excitement.

Mario Wonder Switch includes various references and throwbacks to earlier titles, making it a nostalgia trip for me. It's a pleasure to share these moments with my kids and tell them about the good old days of gaming.\n\nReplay Value:\nThe game's extensive content and collectibles add significant replay value. Exploring every nook and cranny, hunting for Power Moons, and trying to achieve 100% completion is a journey that keeps the fun going long after the main story is completed.

                "4": "Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.\n\nMy first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn’t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.\n\nWhen Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I’d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn’t been playing any games as of late.\n\nAll that to say, this game is simply wonderful. “Wonder” was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.\n\nThe gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can’t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.\n\nI’m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can’t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario’s, but I’m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It’s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.\n\n10/10",
                "5": "OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.",
                "6": "The graphics are a visual treat. The vibrant colors and detailed landscapes make every level a work of art. It's like playing in a living, breathing cartoon world, and it's utterly captivating.\n\nThe gameplay is where the real magic happens. Whether you're jumping on Goombas, collecting coins, or discovering hidden power-ups, it's an exhilarating experience that takes me back to the nostalgia of my childhood. And the controls on the Nintendo Switch are so intuitive; it's gaming bliss.\n\nOne of my favorite scenarios is playing this game with friends. It's pure multiplayer fun! Competing in challenges, cooperating on tough levels, or simply exploring together - it's a blast every time.\n\nThe replay value is outstanding. With so many levels and secrets to uncover, I find myself coming back for more, each time with a sense of wonder and anticipation.",
                "7": "Overall it's a nice game. Bought this for my kid but I play with him sometimes. Graphics are nice and Mario super powers are cool and way more that it use to be. Worlds are very elaborated and it's cool that u can add another player on the spot",
                "8": "Title says it all. This is an excellent game. It's peak platforming with a ton of charm and unique ideas.\n\nOne one complaint is how difficult multiplayer can be. It's definitely functional but with some stranger choices regarding who is \"player 1,\" a too-zoomed-in camera following whoever is in the lead, and stages that are affected by individual player movements, this game feels optimized for single-player. Great for a solo play. Less good for play with family and friends.",
                "9": "So I have to say that I was almost disappointed months ago to learn that Nintendo was making another 2D Mario game. The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I’ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn’t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I’m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn’t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn’t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I’m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it’s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I’d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!! Get this game. You won’t be disappointed. 10/10",
                "10": "This is so fun!!! Last year I got this deep, insane itch to play Super Mario Bros. on 3DS, which is what I grew up playing. However, after digging through my games, I couldn't find it. My local game store has the game marked up so high that I decided I would rather cry and keep my money. So when Nintendo came out with this game this year, I jumped for joy. It has so many cool features, including having different gaming experiences with each character you play as, which results in essentially an infinite number of different playing experiences. So cool. Buy. It."

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "I absolutely love the product. I had a spat when I got it. It didn't have a charger for the dock. However talking to Amazon Support they corrected it for me and I was able to get a charger off the store. With the Switch Oled, you not only are able to have a bit more vibrant colors, but the system itself has great battery life. I had the original switch and this is leagues better. I literally had the switch in my bed for 4 days playing off and on and within those 4 days the battery went as low as 30% and the charging happens fairly quick, not to mention you can dock it and play it while it charges on a big screen tv.\n\nSO IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A SWITCH IS OR HOW IT WORKS LET ME EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES\n\n1. theres 3 versions\n- Switch (original one with a dock and can be played on a tv w/ a smaller screen than Oled)\n- Switch lite (the hand held version with no dock and can't be played on a tv)\n- Switch Oled (newest one, vibrant colors on screen, Larger screen, and has a tv dock)\n\n2. Games\n- The switch is one of the better nintendo systems that have more 3rd party games on it, although the selections are smaller than the Playstation and Xbox, the switch gives you versatility to not only bring it with you on the go to play games, it gives you the action to play with multiple people by separating the joy cons (controllers) and with that you can use each one sideways as a controller allowing two people to play and with multiple joy cons you can have a session of multiple people.\n\n-It has both digital and cartridge games. the cartridge games are very small, and they also have a fast install time. The games are very fun to play and have lots of multiplayer options. No full VoIP on the system but they have an app for cellphones to use.\n\n- the store usually has great deals on titles as most of the cartridge games cost full price or barely have anything discounted at places like Target, Walmart or Gamestop.\n\n3. How they work (docked versions)\n- a docked Switch connects to the TV, it allows the device to charge and you can play games as it charges on the dock.\n- it has a tabletop mode where you can play games on the screen as a tv. In other words you can still use a controller but have the tablet part standing upwards as you use a full controller to play on it.\n- Handheld is where the Joy cons are attached to the tablet and you use it like a handheld or similar to a gameboy or something in that way.\n\nPersonally it's worth the money and Nintendo has usually very good systems that last a long time. Although they might not be the best graphically they have some fun family friendly first party games.",
                "2": "First, to be clear, I play exclusively in handheld mode. (No proper technophile allows a video game system to be connected to their 4k tv if it does not output 4k. LOL!) I am also a console (Xbox) gamer and have been playing video games since the mid 1980s.\n\nWith that being said, this device is shockingly awesome. Why? You can basically play games with the graphically fidelity of almost (but not quite) the Xbox One/PS 4 in your hands. This blows me away. The fact that I can play NBA 2k, FIFA, Need for Speed, Grid, Mortal Kombat, Puzzle Quest and so many other games on the go is truly a joy to behold. As a result, much to my surprise, this has been the console I have ended up playing the most. It's easy to see why - I can take it with me wherever I go. I travel for work and personal reasons. This is with me and I can continue playing my games on it. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy my Xbox experience and still play PC games as well. They are awesome. However, I notice I play this more because it can be on an airplane with me, in the bed, during lunch at work, when I travel, etc. Then, sometimes when I get home, I may want to continue my gaming. So it is racking up more hours than my Xbox and PC (which I certainly still enjoy).\n\nThen, the OLED screen is gorgeous. I had an original Switch. I absolutely love this screen, the brightness, sharpness and clarity. Some games look totally different. If you already have an original Switch, if you can, sell it (or give it away) and get this one. I absolutely love it. I even bought a 512GB micro SD card. I am in a form of gaming Nirvana. You will really enjoy this model.\n\nFinally, I do think that Nintendo is in a truly awesome position with the Switch. I am not sure if Nintendo even realizes how close they are to dominating the video game market for decades. Why? Think about it. As of January 2022 the Switch is the leading console with over 100 million units sold. It really, at this point, needs one thing to finish off the competition for decades. What is it they need? Just a little more power. If Nintendo creates a device that has the graphical and processing power of an Xbox One/PS4, can do 1080p in handheld mode, with a 7 inch OLED screen, (and 4k when docked) Nintendo will rule gaming for at least a decade. Why? 1080p on OLED, at the handheld distance from the eye, appears almost as detailed as 4k at a tv watching distance. With the processing power of the Xbox One/PS4, developers can bring tons of more of their best games (triple A titles) to the Switch. So, a Switch that powerful, with a large number of triple A games on it and with a screen that good in handheld mode, the Switch's market share would crush the competition.\n\nAt any rate, I digress. If you are considering this device. Get it! Period. The build is so awesome on this variant. You will love it.\n\nI have to go now. I have to play my OLED Switch - LOL!\n\nAlso, the delivery from this seller was also good. It came ahead of time.",
                "3": "The Nintendo Switch - OLED Model with Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con is an exceptional gaming device that delivers an immersive and visually stunning gaming experience.

                "4": "I love my switch. The graphics run much smoother on OLED. It was totally worth the purchase! If you’re going to buy a switch, go all the way with the LED. I own all 3 versions, the original, two lites and the OLED and I love the OLED the most! Quick delivery, brand spanking new. If you’re going to get one be mindful of the country you buy it from, as it will impact you. Meaning, you don’t want a version not made for USA if you live here as the charging components will not work. Outside of that you’re good to go!",
                "5": "I think the screen itself improves the playing experience so much compared to the first switch model. The screen is what you would expect of an OLED screen nice bright deep colors with true black. Battery lasts 2-3 hours but i've only tested that with Animal Crossing New Horizons. I enjoy watching youtube on here as well. Dock modes work perfectly fine as well!",
                "6": "This moderate upgrade of the Nintendo Switch is definitely worth spending an extra $50 to get if you are already in the market for a new Switch. The most important question though, is if it's worth it for the people who already own a Switch. This depends a lot on personal preference as well as how old your current switch is (and if you own the original HAC001 from 2017-2019 or the V2 that released in late summer of 2019). I mostly play in handheld mode because that is what this console excels at, for playing on a TV/Monitor, there are plenty of better options.\n\nSo what do you get with this OLED model? You get a larger screen that is OLED instead of IPS LCD. This is the type of screen that most iPhones have used since 2017 (and all of them use it now except for the SE2). You get a better contrast ratio, meaning deeper blacks and brighter colors/whites. There is no HDR support like Dolby Vision or HDR10, but it still looks leagues better than all the other Switch models. The smaller borders around the screen make the device look more modern and it's the size they should have gone with from the beginning (even if the logistics of using OLED wasn't feasible in 2017). There is also improved speakers, they do sound better and make the games your playing sound larger and more immersive. It's not as big of a difference as the new screen is to the old screen, but it's still a good thing to include.\n\nAnother new features is a better kickstand that is more like that of a Surface Pro tablet, allowing the Switch to be able to lean all the way back and be much more sturdy while doing so. This isn't really important unless you play in tabletop mode, but this is more realistic of a way to use this console with the screen being just that much bigger, I could see myself using a Pro controller and sitting the switch down for certain types of games.\n\nThe last difference here is the dock, which has a built in Ethernet port, which you should really use if you have the option to go wired. Unlike in the previous model \"regular Switch\", a wired connection is basically twice as fast as using standard WiFI, before it was only about 1.5x as fast. It still is unfortunate that you cannot achieve 100Mbps download speeds, but 60-65 is better than the 40-45 I was getting on my older model.\n\nIf I had to oversimplify who should buy the OLED model, I would say that these two types of people should buy the OLED (even if they already have a Switch Lite or V2) It would be: techie people who are nerdy about their tech and want the best they can get (even when they don't need it), and serious gamers who sink hundreds and hundreds of hours into playing the Switch in handheld mode.\n\nAlso, I don’t know that we need to specify this anymore because the switch OLED has largely been in stock since early January. But I did not and would not pay one penny more than $350 (plus tax) for this console. I think it’s worth that price if you love Nintendo characters/games, but I don’t think the hardware is worth more than $400 and the tax gets it pretty close to that.",
                "7": "If you would have told me 40 years ago I'd be playing games that look like this anywhere I wanted, I would have thought you were crazy (Let alone come home and finish playing it on my TV!) With an amazing library of games and accessories, I'm having an absolute blast playing my switch. Having an OLED screen is just the cherry on top of the Sunday!",
                "8": "This is the new OLED version of the Nintendo Switch. Decided to replace his old Switch that cracked from an accidental drop one day. Turned out to be the perfect B-day gift. He loves it! The screen is bigger and the colors are superior in every way to what his old Switch looked like. Amazing how much more vibrant the games look with this new version. All his little buddies want one now too!",
                "9": "I'm old. I know nothing of these things. I started to \"google\" and \"research,\" (WTF happened to the trip to the library; pouring through the books and being b***ched out by the Gestapo librarian... these kids are missing so much...) and i found this one seemed to be what I wanted to \"gift\" my grandson & son. We all live together, vicariously and pseudo-parasidically, and some diversion is in order. SOOOO... g'ma is springing for some entertainment. Son Prince informs me what I want is *this* which is good cuz I already ordered it cuz I was running out of time and I dont like to shop, but \"google\" said this one was best for our age group. (4 year old, and two adults that act 4). It came, and I asked said Son set it up and make sure it worked and was what they wanted. Himself and Herself played the godsdamned thing until 4:00am making all varieties of shrieks and gleeful commentary (small house, something of a typical disturbance) and we're set for the \"big day.\" Strongly recommend. I need a drink.",
                "10": "This is my first gaming console after a long time, before I played on old PS and Nintendo 2DS, but this OLED switch is day and night difference. I gifted this to my 9 years old daughter and a 5 years old son. They're having party at home now!! Choosing a gaming console appropriate to audiences I got (my kids of course), was no brainer 1/Since this console can be played handheld so travel friendly with kids 2/Can be easily switched to TV for big screen experience 3/Multiplayer games are fun because you have two joycons 4/Light weight on the hands 5/Joycons are most suitable for your kids, however, both Joycons can be clubbed to use as full controller on Joycon Grip 6/Docking is breeze 7/Longer play time on switch screen 8/Kids can use switch as Table Top mode (use the inbuilt screen and put it on table and play when on travel, fun to have both kids sit side by side in a car 9/The Dock is light weight and HDMI, LAN and power adapter can be connected 10/You can charge with USB-C while on travel.. Now few things can be improved 1/Joycons can be confusing sometimes, the buttons on both Joycons play imp role so kids are confused which to press when on mutilplayer mode, so it can be simplify 2/Docking is so light weight that it is being dragged sometimes if you connect with TV on HDMi cable, so need extra few grams weight to stay put properly 3/Games are insanely pricy, I mean almost all Mario games are about 60 bucks a game!!! So buy the switch, and then buy those costly games!! No discount I saw so far on Mario games 4/I need to check the switch specs, but I am sure there is no 4K support even I connected to my Sony Bravia x90K 85\" 4K/120 Hz HDMi 2.1 input, used HDMi 4 input which is 4K/120 Hz compatible. 5/Sound on switch is alright, well, good that your kids won't annoy you while they play on switch and not on TV 6/Internal memory is adequate, only 64GB, initially okay but can't put more games if you gonna install more than 15 (3 gb per game), should be alright if kids want to experiment free games and just recycle them.\n\nNothing major negative though, all good so far! Hopefully you will enjoy your brand new console! So far I love it since my 5 years Son can easily handle without much adult supervision!!! Go for it and yes, it brand new item!!!"

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "This is an absolutely phenomenal, hyper faithful, and even improved version of Super Mario RPG's Legend of the Seven Stars.\nOne of the greatest RPGs ever made.\nIn some ways, it's probably the greatest Mario game ever made.\n\nThis remake only changes one tiny relatively insignificant thing in a way that I find questionable, it changes several things in ways that make sense and are probably objectively better, and then it makes a number of dramatic improvements that feel like they should have been there all along in the original game from 30 years ago.\n\nEverything looks gorgeous.\n\nThe game is absolutely delightful and hilarious.\n\nThe music is iconic and infectious.\nYou're going to hear it in your brain for the rest of your life.\nAnd that's a GREAT thing.\n\nIt brings life to the Mushroom World In a way that few games ever have, even in the 30 years since this game originally came out.\nIt makes Mario into a fun character. It gives personalities to icons like Peach and Bowser.\n\nThis is the game that introduced various features of these characters that we would go on to see in later games, especially stuff like Peach being equipped with umbrellas and frying pans, or treating fireballs as sort of a default power that Mario has up his sleeve, even without picking up a Fire Flower (as we see in Super Smash Bros).\n\nThis game also introduces a number of unique new characters who are absolutely fantastic, and deserve to be in dozens of more games.\nGeno, Mallow, Croco, Booster, Johnny, etc.\n\nIn a year when The Legend Of Zelda:Tears Of The Kingdom came out, Super Mario RPG's remake ended up being my Game Of The Year.\nAs great as TOTK is, and as much crazy big ambitious stuff and complexity as it rings to the table, it falls faaaaar short of achieving its true potential, and there are huge swaths of that game that feel lacking and incomplete.\nSuper Mario RPG does not have that problem for even a second.\nEverything in Super Mario RPG feels like it is living VERY close to the maximum potential of the Mario franchise.\nEvery second is fun. Everything is interesting. The whole world is full of stuff to find and do, and people to talk to, and silly jokes and gags, and interesting little story bits.\nHow many dungeons and boss fights are there in Zelda TOTK? Maybe 10 if you count one instance of each species of big regular monster (Ganon, Temple bosses, Hinox, Gleeok, Talus, Flux Construct, etc?)\nI have literally no idea how many boss fights Super Mario RPG has.\nThere are so so many.\nSuper Mario RPG has like 4-5 boss battles JUST within the tutorial area. I can think of at least 30 bosses in Super Mario RPG, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but for a game that came out 30 years ago, and has only been minimally upgraded in this remake, it is SHOCKINGLY close.\n\nOf all the Mario games that exist, this one is One of the must-have games in the series, alongside: Super Mario World, Super Mario Bros 3, Super Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with all the DLC, Super Mario Bros Wonder,.....and the remake of Super Mario 64 that they absolutely desperately need to make.....\n\nThis is better than the original Mario Bros, the original Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros The Lost levels, Super Mario Bros 2, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2, all the Paper Mario games, all the Super Mario Land games, all the Mario Party games, almost all of the Mario Kart games, all the Mario sports games, etc etc etc.\n\nThis belongs in that core handful of Mario games that every gamer needs to play to understand how phenomenal Mario can truly be.\n\nIt's a tiny thumbnail-sized game cartridge full of happiness.\n\n🤷🏻‍♂️",
                "2": "Such an amazing game-It’s incredible as a first time play, and sweetly nostalgic as a remake for those (like me) who played the original. The gameplay is smooth as ever, the visuals are stunning and heartwarming, and the development of the characters is incredibly endearing (both with their storylines and how they grow in battle).\nThe original has personally always been my favorite game of all time, and this version on the switch is even better.",
                "3": "The game holds very true to the original. Improved graphics, quality of life improvements to inventory, combat and overall management.\nSome of the bosses and characters have new names (not sure what those are about, one could be cultural sensitivity, which is fine), but it doesn't detract from the overall game.\nVery happy to play this and it goes much faster than I remember (I'm on story mode, so that could be part of it, also very happy that's an option for the more casual gamer!).",
                "4": "There will, no doubt, be those who disagree with this sentiment, but as someone who dearly loves the original game, and has played through it several times over the course of my life, THIS is what every remake of any game should aspire to. It keeps faithful to the original game, while improving on it in many ways. Some fights feel easier, while others feel harder. Parts of the game I would have sworn were longer are now shorter. There are cutscenes that add more to basically all of the characters, the updated graphics keep all the charm of the game's style while looking great, and the ending cinematic made me smile like a little kid. One of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time, brought by a brilliant remake of an already excellent game. I'd give it more than five stars if I could. Seven would seem an appropriate number.",
                "5": "If you are expecting a typical side scroll 2D jump, jump, jump Mario game, you will be disappointed (watch the trailers).\n\nBasic Plot: Mario and his team must join together and save all the people in the mushroom kingdom from the evil Smithy, a monster who destroyed the star road so that people’s wishes will never come true (simplified version).\n\nGeneral review: The game stays true to the original SNES title with minor changes and quality of life improvements. The game looks fantastic and plays true to the original. The plot and story are much more complex compared to typical Mario saves Peach games. The characters are extremely unique and bring a whole lot of personality to the Mario world and characters we love. It is not an open world game, but there are still quite a few areas to explore with secrets and treasures to find.\n\nGameplay: The fight sequences use a turn based style where the three people in your party take turns to attack before your enemy (s) will have their turn to counter attack (simple explanation of it). The turn based style can be repetitive and boring if you are not accustomed to this gameplay or looking for something more fast paced.\n\nGameplay: This is an RPG so you do gain experience points as you slay enemies and level up your party members. When you level, you will have 3 options to pick from: physical attack/defense, magical attack/defense, or health/hp. Whichever you pick, the stats within that category will increase. For an RPG, it is a very simple leveling system and easy to understand without getting overly complex.\n\nMy experience: Personally, I played/beat the original SNES countless times and was able to beat this remastered version to 100% within 12 hours… but again, experience was on my side. I would say for someone new to this, it could take them 10 - 20 hours - a shorter and easier RPG with a captivating plot.\n\nFinal thoughts: It is an easy RPG for experienced players but you play for the story (or nostalgia), not the difficulty. If you are looking for a good, easy introduction to RPGs, this is a good game to start with for not being overly complicated. If you do not like turn based attacks, RPGs, or just looking for a typical fast paced challenging Mario game, this is not the game for you.\n\n5 stars for a 1-1 remaster of the original (with additional, new gameplay content) and what I expected the game would be.",
                "6": "This was my first RPG I remember playing back in 1996. It launched my love of turn based role playing games. I think I beat this game a few dozen times on the Super Nintendo when I was 12. I have very fond memories of this game. So when I heard it was being released on the switch I was very excited.\n\nI broke one of my cardinal rules of game buying with this. I pre-ordered it. Nintendo rarely has launch issues with games but I still try to avoid pre-ordering games. But I couldn't help myself with this one.\n\nThe game is excellent. They upgraded the graphics which may have taken away some of the charm of the original but I think it looks great. They even kept in the 2d OG mario Easter Egg in Boosters Tower, and pixelated Culex boss. The game play was exactly as I remembered it and still a joy to play.\n\nNintendo made a few quality of life improvements to the game. First they created a Breezy mode which makes the game just a bit easier. It lifts the item cap, makes the timed attack window larger and more forgiving, and makes the enemies easier (I have my 6 year old playing on this setting).\n\nOther QOL improvements include adding an icon to help with timed attacks. A chest in Mario's house to carry extra items where in the original they would just be lost. The game now auto saves pretty frequently (usually as you enter a new area), so you don't have to search out a save location. They also added a upgrade to the signal ring that makes it easier to find hidden treasures, that can be acquired later in the game. They also added post game play, making the bosses more challenging and adding new weapons and gear.\n\nMost of the online reviews to this game forget it's an introductory RPG meant for children. They nitpick and complain about the lack of challenge. Super Mario RPG is a fantastic game that will take around 13 hours to beat, but it's a great 13 hours. If you played this game in the 90s get it. If you have a child and are looking to get them a forgiving turn based RPG to learn, get this game. If you are looking for 13 hours of fun without the grind of games like Final Fantasy, get this game. If you want a challenging grueling slog that will take hours off your life and leave you angry most of the time, get Dark Souls.",
                "7": "The developers of this game knew exactly what it would take to please the fans of this game. Simply put, this game is the best remake that I have played in the past couple of years. It has so much love poured into it, every detail that I expected to be here from the original game is here- and additional content. I was incredibly scared that the hype for this game was going to end up causing it to be a bad game, but that is not the case.\n\nThis is a fantastic game that caters to both fans of the original game and those who are wanting to get into RPGs. I have seen several 1 star reviews, and to be completely honest those reviews seemed to have come from those who have never played an RPG before and expected simply another Mario game coming into this. I can't think of anything that this game doesn't improve upon from the original game. The RPG mechanics are engaging, even difficult at times with having the player time certain actions within battles to drastically change the gameplay. However, it does a fantastic job with the ! indicators telling the player when to properly time their button presses.\n\nThe story is of course a remake of the original title on the SNES, however I believe that its humor still stands today. I can't really say many games today make me laugh the way they intended or at least without a slight awkward feeling at a forced joke, but this game actually makes me smile more often than not. This game has some seriously funny moments, and the modernized visuals make scenes much more entertaining.\n\nThe only negative element I can even come up with for this game is the slight frame drops when the scene gets too intense with effects and too many models. Aside from that, the game runs at seemingly a solid 60 fps, with 30 fps for the cutscenes. Aside from the random moments of lag, the game is beautiful and runs fantastic.\n\nI without a doubt recommend this game.",
                "8": "Short RPG games are rare, so if you want something you can complete in 10 hours or so, then Super Mario RPG can be great for you. The gameplay is fun and the writing is still as charming as the original title that came out nearly three decades ago. It's definitely worth its price.\n\nThe post game has been expanded upon, too.",
                "9": "The problem with remaking video games is the design philosophy around what a remake should even try to accomplish. Video games just don't age as well as products from most other mediums. True, I love video games and they are my favorite way to pass time, but game mechanics, graphics and interactivity can resonate with older audiences that hadn't encountered them before while newer ones will often at best find them quaint and others find them cumbersome. Should a remake essentially tart up the aesthetics and keep the core gameplay the same, winning over the original audience but potentially losing the new? Or should a remake shake things up, evolving what was rusty from the ground up, risking the loss of what made the game special to begin with?\n\nSuper Mario RPG is unabashedly in the first camp. It is very safe. It introduces some minor mechanics like the triple attacks that don't factor much in moment to moment gameplay at all, and adds some boss rematches and such. It sticks close to the original, remaking the graphics and music but not really shaking up the script, the general story, the turn based gameplay or the bad platforming (for a Mario game, even an RPG, that's honestly a serious flaw for a game with a lot of it).\n\nSpeaking as someone who has always had a fascination with Super Mario RPG, but never played through it entirely, this remake gave me my fill. I still prefer its successors; the first two Paper Marios are simply tighter, more engaging experiences. Regardless, this game is funny, quite charming, and has lots of cute metagame moments, like a boss that literally disables your attack options (novel for 1996). I do think it loses a bit in the jump to 3D; the original 2D, chunky graphics were beautiful and strange and compelling and gave rise to many memes because of it. The remake looks good but in a bland way, not blocky and puffy like the old sprites but losing a bit of their memorability. The music is of course fantastic. Yoko rarely misses.\n\nIt's a strangely unbalanced experience, in terms of pacing. Some stars are found much quicker than others, and a decent amount of the story feels like padding, albeit amusing padding. The final area(s) feel rushed and the finicky imprecise jumping controls I feel really falter here.\n\nIf it sounds like my review is a little harsher than kind, it's because I hadn't grown up with this game and I'm approaching it as an N64 kid playing it for the first time being almost in my thirties. People who played and loved the original will have plenty of fun seeing what was changed, reliving iconic moments and so on. In all honesty it's a good game, and still worth playing. All Mario RPGs, and even many RPGs in general now, borrow a lot from this game and that has to be acknowledged. It's influential for a reason; the people at Square clearly loved making this game, and that rubs off on the player. I just wish that reverence could factor into bolder gestures toward making the game fresher over 25 years later, and by not charging full price for what is nearly the same amount of game content from '96.\n\nRecommended if you like Mario, easy SNES RPGs, and big Yoshis, and especially if you like all three.",
                "10": "This is nearly a 1 to 1 remake of the original Super Mario RPG game. The music remaster is beautiful and you can even opt for the original soundtrack in the settings. But the remaster of the music is so good you may not want to. All the little things you may remember (if you played the original) are still there. The hidden block you only have one or two opportunities to grab in the Mushroom Kingdom... Link and Samus snoozing at the inn.\n\nWhat they did is they recreated the entire game with updated HD graphics. But kept Mario's pudgy little design the same. The \"cutscenes\" have been replaced with full rendered cutscenes that pan down to in game engine graphics instead of just watching in game graphics move about to act out a scene.\n\nThe best change though is the post game content. Rematches with all the bosses (story element explains why) and they are much tougher the second time around. New \"ultimate\" weapons post game and even some new super bosses to use those shiny new weapons on.\n\nThey pretty much kept the original experience until you beat the game. After that, they gave you more to chew on as additions. A bestiary. A music player. In game stats. Super bosses, rematches, new gear.\n\nThis is how you do a remaster. A proper remaster.\n\nI truly hope they use all this effort to give this game a long overdue sequel. Because it is one of the best Mario games out there. Paper Mario and the Mario + Luigi games can't hold a candle to this."

Combat is fluid and responsive, with a variety of weapons and abilities that allow for different strategies to tackle the challenges ahead.\n\nThe story is rich and well-paced, with a perfect balance of dramatic moments and lighthearted humor that the series is known for. The music and sound design are impeccable, enhancing the emotional impact of the narrative and the thrill of exploration.",
                "3": "If you've been on the fence about getting Tears of the Kingdom, don't wait any longer – it's a game worth experiencing.\n\nPROS:\n\nPhenomenal Gameplay\n-Tears of the Kingdom takes gameplay to a whole new level, surpassing even Breath of the Wild. Its mechanics offer immense freedom in both puzzles and combat, enriching the exploration aspect.\n\nRefreshing Changes\n-While it shares the same world as Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom introduces enough modifications and new content to keep things feeling fresh. You'll often find yourself wondering about the transformed towns and the whereabouts of familiar characters.\n\nStunning Visuals\n-The cel-shading style and improved lighting make the game's visuals simply breathtaking. You'll frequently catch yourself marveling at the beauty, like watching the sunset from a sky island.\n\nEngaging Story\n-Though not groundbreaking, the story adds depth to the game. They've done an excellent job with Zelda's character, and it's enjoyable to connect the dots between the new events in Tears of the Kingdom and what transpired between it and Breath of the Wild.\n\nCONS:\nPerformance Issues\n-One downside is occasional lag, even on an OLED. If you have an older Switch, you may experience even worse frame drops, which can be quite frustrating.\n\nDisconnect from BOTW\n-Tears of the Kingdom seems to distance itself from being a sequel to accommodate players who haven't experienced Breath of the Wild. While avoiding spoilers, the game often assumes you know nothing about the previous game, and characters act as if they've never met you before. It's not a deal-breaker but feels like an odd design choice.",
                "4": "Negatives first:\nThere are a decent amount of reused themes and mechanics that I do wish they could have changed up a bit. There is definitely some repetitiveness there.\nThe graphics (and I am not a graphics-first person...ever) are a problem here and there...I think it's a theming choice made by nintendo more than anything, but in the sky islands they add this cloudiness effect to everything (even in sky island caves) that can make it difficult to discern things. It's hard to explain, but I actually had to change my display settings to crank up the contrast (which is screwing up my settings on my other games and consoles). My kids even mentioned how hard it is to see things at times.\n\nPositives\nPeople are complaining about similarity to BotW....and I don't get it. As big as the BotW world was, it feels small compared to this game. I'm about 10 hours in, I haven't done anything yet that felt like a retread (other than what I mentioned above). It has the same \"see something out of the corner of your eye, go investigate, and lose two hours\" trait that I loved about BotW.\nThis game is much more story driven (not through flashbacks) thus far, which is great.\n\nSo-so\nThe new weapons mechanics are cool...but I do miss more traditional weapons at times. So far (and this may change as I get deeper) everything I've found is stupid under powered, you always have to craft to have anything useful. The crafting/building is fun and new, but how you HAVE TO do so much of it that it can be game-breaking here and there.\n\nI love the game, I can't wait until I have some real time to sink a few uninterrupted days into it. It is not perfect, but I still gave it a perfect score because the fun-factor and awe of BotW are absolutely in-tact and the scale is unbelievable. The positives erase the negatives in my mind.",
                "5": "Stepping into a new chapter in the iconic Legend of Zelda series, \"Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\" is a masterclass in video game design. Drawing upon the rich history of this beloved franchise, this game artfully interweaves nostalgic elements with a fresh, innovative perspective, making it a must-play for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. I truly though it would just be a chewed-up and spit-out breath of the wild, its not, its better!\n\nWhat immediately captivates the player is the deeply immersive world, teeming with intricate details and the unparalleled charm we've come to expect from the Zelda franchise. Every kingdom, every landscape feels alive and filled with potential adventure, inviting players to lose themselves in the exploration.\n\nThe game mechanics remain faithful to the Zelda essence, while introducing new, cleverly designed features that elevate the overall gaming experience. It has the same shrine system as botw but new ways to work through puzzles and rewards you for being inventive.\n\nThe narrative of \"Tears of the Kingdom\" is enchanting and engaging, drawing you into its depths with each progressing plot point. The character development, including the evolving relationship between Link and Zelda, is genuinely touching and contributes greatly to the emotional resonance of the story.\n\nHowever, it's worth mentioning that \"Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\" is a game that demands time and patience. The expansive world and multiple sub-quests can be overwhelming to some, but for those willing to invest the effort, the rewards are plentiful.\n\nThe only slight drawback is the game's item-breaking mechanic. weapons you love will break and you will miss them. That being said just keep with it and soon you will find something even better.",
                "6": "This is Link at his finest. He has really grown into the super hero role he was meant to have.\n\nThe story is a bit lackluster, as usual. There are lots of quests and so much content that you can spend hundreds of hours playing this, but the stories are always a little cringy and lame. It is meant to be kid-safe, after all.\n\nThe game mechanics are where this game shines. Zonai devices allow you to build practically any kind of vehicle you want. Like Minecraft, except that things are meant to move, with circles and everything. The physics is extremely robust. Link can engineer up doomsday devices and ride them into enemy camps.\n\nThe game design is beautiful, just like its predecessor, Breath of the Wild. It's the same Hyrule surface map, but there are over a hundred new cave systems, a sky island map, and a Depths map, which is sort of an Upside Down under Hyrule. I like that the devs kept the best parts of BotW and merely expanded it into a whole new kind of game.\n\nCombat in BotW/TotK is great, and lots of fun. Back when I was playing Zelda for NES and SNES, I never would have imagined that the game franchise would get to this level of amazing.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the story. There is basically no consistency between Zelda games, each one has to be taken as its own independent narrative. I know there are people who try to mesh it all together -- even Nintendo came out with a timeline once -- but I don't buy it. If their next game could be both consistent within itself, and utilize the best aspects of all past Zelda stories, Nintendo could set up future games after that for sequential story telling, and that would be fantastic. It's the only thing the game is missing.\n\nThis is basically a single player RPG meets Open World Sandbox. The best kind of RPG. You can follow quest lines, and there are many -- you can collect things, there are tons of things to collect -- or you can just build devices and defeat enemies for fun. You don't even have to pursue the main story line and you can still love this game. Highly recommend!!",
                "7": "Where to begin with this game? Did you enjoy Breath of the Wild? Were you frustrated by certain aspects? If the answer was yes to both, you’ll love this game.\n\nI have been a Zelda fan all the way back to playing Zelda 2 when I was 4. And when Breath of the Wild came out, I was blown away, but also frustrated by aspects of it. Yes the game did away with most of the standard Zelda formula, but enough still remained for me to enjoy it as a Zelda game. What blew me away though was the size of the game, the focus on exploration and many other things. However, many things frustrated me like how long it took to get around, warping to shrines was easy, but losing your horse was always a serious pain.\n\nNow we arrive at the new game Tears of the Kingdom, clearly a sequel to BOTW that uses the same map, but manages to keep it fresh by introducing sky islands and the depths. And first off, if you felt BOTW had a massive map, this will blow you away. There is so much more to explore, but yet the game moves SO much faster by changing the towers from things you have to slowly climb to activate to just making them usually have a small puzzle to get them activated. Once you have these towers up, the game gets MUCH easier to navigate as each launches you miles into the sky where you can glide down toward the next closest one, or perhaps a shrine or other notable area. This eliminated the problem I had with horses and in fact, I barely used mine over the course of the entire game.\n\nThe new powers you gain at the start also open this up to a realm of creativity previously offered by other games like Minecraft, but in a Zelda game, it feels fresh. I can only say this game will feel like a dream to any engineers or someone with an interest in building. You can truly get lost in crafting weapons or vehicles, but even if only done when necessary it’s a lot of fun. I who think the shrine puzzles have gotten much harder (at least for someone like me), but they were still fun and brilliant to experience.\n\nFinally there’s the story. I was surprised after feeling BOTW had a very forgettable story that this had a very rich and emotional story as you learn about how Ganondorf came to power and was originally defeated, as well and the truth of what happened to Zelda after the start of the game. I absolutely love it and all the characters. Honestly, the only two Zelda games to top this for me are Wind Waker and Link’s Awakening.\n\nSo yes, to sum up, this is easily one of the best Zelda games of all time and improves on BOTW so much, I can’t even see myself revisiting that game now.",
                "8": "Perfect sequel to Zelda Breath of The Wild. Link has several new abilities (will list later) to play around with\n\nWorld is more expansive: There’s the Great Plateau (old Breath of the Wild map) with slightly altered environments due to gloom infection, the sky city, and the depths (huge underground cave network below hyrule). Smoke and highlighted light pillars shows points of interest in the overworld without having to look at the map\n\nWeapon durability is back. I know some people don’t like breakable items/weapons, but it teaches kids to be more adaptable rather than have constant/sustainable gains all the time. Also helps them be more creative in the fusing items together. Items are less scarce this time around giving you more opportunities to experiment with new combinations\n\nStill have freedom to be creative and do what you want. Can think of creative ways to cheat the puzzle with new abilities instead of the intended way of doing it, making the experience your own. Gives you the ‘I don’t think we are supposed to do that, but it worked!’ moments\n\nTemples return. Each one have a companion character which grants you special abilities for that temple/dungeon. Bosses at end of temples are really powerful and not just simple advanced moving puzzles\n\n-Menu/UI is more streamline.\n\nInventory tabs can be changed via L1 R1 trigger instead of thumbstick. No need to go through multiple pages to get to the next tab. Instead you scroll down if you have a lot of items\n\nSettings is at the end of inventory tab instead of a separate page\n\nAble to view recipes on sub menu for each item\n\n-Story/Plot:\n\nLink and Zelda is exploring a unknown area under hyrule castle. They accidentally awaken an mummy and he uses gloom ability to attack them. Link arm and master sword gets infected during initial battle, and the mummy released gloom infecting hyrule. There’s a huge quake and Link both get separated during the scuffle. You wake up and go on a quest to find Zelda, re-forge the master sword and save hyrule.\n\nStory is the most expansive than any other Zelda title focusing a lot of character development\n\nLike Breath of the Wild; there’s limited voice acting and not fully voiced. But that doesn’t detract from the experience\n\n--- Abilities\n\n1. Ultra Hand\n\nUse this to lift large heavy object and fuse them together. Can use it to solve puzzles lifting heavy objects to build bridges, ramps, ladders, etc) but also use as a vehicle creator for traversal. It’s very similar to Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts vehicle creator. Vehicles you create use fuel/battery to operate, collecting/using zonai charges refuels your vehicle giving you the ability to travel longer distances especially when creating gliders. You can also upgrade maximum battery as you progress through he game. Note that our creation despawns if you’re too far away from it, so best not abandon it\n\n2. Merge items\n\nFuse any two items together in inventory. Mainly use to create weapons with different properties (higher attack, range, elemental damage etc) and increase durability. Seeing weapon durability is back gives players ways to experiment and be resourceful with what they have in their inventory\n\nDuring combat you’re able to able to throw individual items\n\n3. Asend\nAble to teleport to above flat platform when directly under it. Some areas are restricted if it’s too high. The cursor on your screen when using ability turns green to indicate if it’s possible to ascend or not\n\n4. Recall\n\nRewind time for a brief second. Great for puzzle solving like climbing up a rock that fell off the cliff and rewind time to ride it up\n\n5. Auto build\n\nAble to re-create previous creations you made with ultra-hand. Just have all items in one spot and use ability to re-create it instead of starting from scratch\n\n6. Amiibo\n\nSimilar to last game, you can in amiibo daily and items will fall in front of you. Amiibo give armor skins, fabrics, and other common items. No exclusive content from Amiibos this time. Able to obtain them via quests. Scanning amiibos just give you them early and more items daily. Disappointed the wolf link amiibo doesn’t give you wolf companion like the last game\n\n7. Camera\n\nBasically an ability to take pictures to fill out the hyrule compendium\n\nOverall extremely fun game giving you freedom to explore and be creative. Best Legend of Zelda game to date.",
                "9": "The short version is that this game improves and expands upon Breath of the Wild in every possible way, with the only real con being that this game pushes the Switch to its absolute limit, and you will encounter a very occasional framerate chug. Also they took away my hearty durians!\n\nVast amounts of Content:\n\nSome were concerned when it was announced this game would utilize the same map from BOTW (its predecessor), so much to the point where it became common to see this game referred to as BOTW DLC prior to its prelease. I can assure you this is not the case. The is the game equivalent of a BMW 1M. Much how like that car was cobbled together from the BMW parts bin, but somehow became one of the best cars they ever made, this game is made with many existing assets and yet surpasses all my expectations. Not only are there sky islands, but their are caves, and an entire other layer of the world to explore (which I won't spoil if you've somehow managed to avoid spoilers for this game). There's also more to the story this time, and I swear they've at least doubled the amount of side content.\n\nMore enjoyable combat:\n\nWhile this game uses the same general combat as BOTW, what's improved is the way you use weapons. They still break if that bothered you before, but I feel far less restricted thanks to the Fuse mechanic, which allows you to combine things with your weapons and shields. The consequence of this is that you feel far less unwilling to use your higher powered weapons. In BOTW I would hoard them, and I still do a little, but I also am at least willing to use them more frequently than before thanks to the fact that I can fuse a weak little stick into something more potent at almost any time. Additionally arrows are far easier to come by, as of writing this I've been on my playthrough for maybe 40-50 hours and have accumulated 200+ arrows without really trying to conserve.\n\nNo hearty durians?\n\nOk, since I brought it up, I'll make this it's own section. At first I hated this, the magical fruit that restored so much health it was almost gamebreaking in BOTW. However, in hindsight I think it was a good call, as I'm using more of the expanded materials/recipes now and it definitely adds to the game.\n\nOther details and conclusion:\n\nI hesitate to go into further details on this as it may spoil the experience of discovery, but I can say that the staples of BOTW are still here. Shrines, resource gathering, great fairies, upgrading your armor, all still play a huge role. The runes from the first game are gone, but are replaced with quirkier and largely more useful abilities, although I do miss the bombs. But even the function of the old remote bomb can be replicated in no less than three ways, depending on the situation. I have not beaten the game, but I have spent about 40-50 hours in this world by my estimate and completed three of the four major temples, and revealed the entire main map. Yet, despite that I feel like I'm still just scratching the surface. There have still been a few new enemy types that I still have no idea how to take down, or I need to collect more hearts/better armor. There is so much to see and do in this game, and so far it's all been very entertaining. I've been playing Zelda since Link's Awakening on Gameboy Color, and although this game like BOTW diverts somewhat from the classic formula, it is definitely in the lead for my favorite Zelda game of all time, and possibly my favorite open world game of all time. Truly fantastic.",
                "10": "The bar was high enough with BoTW, yet Nintendo managed to beat its record. Tears of the Kingdom is a fantastic game, full of new features, and the in-world experiences are satisfying.\nBelow the PRO and CONS\n\nPROS:\n\nAwesome Gameplay\nThe gameplay surpasses the experience you may have playing Breath of the Wild. You can spend countless hours building stuff to help you explore or solve puzzles. The possibilities are infinite.\n\nRefreshing Changes\n-While it shares the same world as Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom introduces enough modifications and new content to keep things fresh. You'll often find yourself wondering about the transformed towns and the whereabouts of familiar characters.\n\nDeep Dive in Hyrule History\n-Though not groundbreaking, the story adds depth to the game. I have been a fan of Zelda since the first game on NES, and the lore we learn in TotK connects with BotW and provides more information about past games. I am in love with Zelda's development as a character, from being a \"damsel in distress\" to becoming the reason why this franchise is called The Legend of Zelda.\n\nCONS:\n\nDisconnect from BOTW\n-Tears of the Kingdom seems to distance itself from being a sequel to accommodate players who haven't experienced Breath of the Wild. While avoiding spoilers, the game often assumes you know nothing about the previous game, and characters act as if they've never met you. It's not a deal-breaker, but it is an odd design choice.\n\nThis is a must-play game for hardcore fans and casual players alike."

It’s much cleaner, prettier & you can customize your character and play with your friends so much easier.\n\nI can access the previous game, 2023’s, whole track list without having to get up and switch my cartridge out. A problem I had with previous games was that if I didn’t have Just Dance Unlimited, I’d have to switch games. With the games becoming codes & being unlockable editions in the central Just Dance app, it’s easy to find my songs. And 2024 is there as well right beside it so there’s no complication, everything is set up really simply.",

Their servers will not load any of the content. Check other reviews (which I should have done first) as it is a widespread problem. An absolute trash/broken game with no immediate fix in site. Save the hassle and don't buy this 2024 version. Go for one of the older years.",

                "7": "I’m proud to add Just Dance 2024 to my ever growing Just Dance collection. As a hardcore just dance fan, it is encouraging to see that this series is still going strong. Here are some of the top highlights:\n\nCAMERA SUPPORT\nYes you read that right! Camera support for cellphones is coming back! It will be available this winter for beta testing!\n\nWORKOUT MODE\nWith accompanying workout tailored choreographies (well, there are two so far) you can now track your calories across any Just Dance/Just Dance + Song! This was a heavily requested feature, I’m glad it’s back!\n\nCHALLENGE MODE\nYou can now challenge other players scores! You will play against their score to encourage you to climb higher on the world leaderboard! But watch out - others can challenge your score too!\n\nSTORY PLAYLIST SEQUEL\nLast year, one of the main highlights was the “Enter the Danceverses” playlist. This year, we have a sequel to that adventure - “Dance with the Swan”. And uh, well…I’ll let you play it to find out what happens….\n\nWhile lots of people have been complaining about “reusing” coaches/backgrounds, I honestly don’t mind it. I get connections with characters, so to see them again is great! (Especially with all the lore going around…) all in all this is a great addition to the JD franchise! Can’t wait for the new year!",
                "8": "Just dance 2024 is an improvement from just dance 2023, but that doesn’t mean it’s perfect. While they have finally added some more modes such has workout mode (which counts the calories you burn) and was called sweat mode in just dance 2022 it is still not in just dance 2023.\n\nThey have also added a challenge mode where you issue a challenge to another player to see who can get a better score on a dance. You can issues challenges to players on your friend list or anyone on the leader boards on any songs. You can also go into your settings and change it where you only accept challenges on your friends list if you do not want any random challenges. You can only access challenge mode if you’re playing online. You do not need Nintendo switch online membership to play online on any just dance games.\n\nThe game also has song sharing a feature that allows just dance 2024 to share the base game song list to their friends who have just dance 2023. If you want to dance to songs on the just dance + then both players must have the just dance + subscription. Which is $25 for one year.\n\nJust dance 2024 says they will have ongoing updates but at the time of release they are still missing the feature of create your own playlist, and the world dance floor an online mode where players from around the world dance to songs in a tournament and try to beat one another. Both of these are available on just dance 2022.\n\nJust dance 2024 will come has a digital code that must be redeemed on the Nintendo store. If you prefer a physical copy then you can buy just dance 2022 since the franchise has gone to digital only for the Nintendo switch editions since just dance 2023.\n\nWith the purchase of the game you’ll get one month of just dance + for free. afterwards you’ll need to pay a separate fee to access all the songs. you will have to go to the just dance + tab on the left to activate your one month free trial.\n\nUnfortunately just like with just dance 2023 you will need to make an Ubisoft account to access the game and get certain emotes and avatars. This is why I will recommend just dance 2022 to people who want to just dance and not bother with making additional accounts to play a game.\n\nI would recommend getting just dance 2022 since it has just dance unlimited the old subscription service to the just dance games.\n\nThe difference between just dance unlimited and just dance + is that just dance + is the new subscription service available for just dance 2023 and 2024 while unlimited is for all the other older just dance games meaning it has more songs! Just dance unlimited has over 700 whole just dance + has maybe 300.\n\nUnfortunately they have now deactivated just dance unlimited and just dance 2022 only has the 40 songs that come with the game.",
                "9": "My star rating is for the gameplay itself not the other issues I'm about to talk about. So, with that said, I have to say that the lack of an option to buy a physical copy of the game really bugs me. I love collecting my little switch game cartridges and I have noticed a little lag a couple times while playing.\n\nBUT\n\nI do enjoy the game, it is fun, and looks good. There are some great song choices however I get really tired of in game ads for the Just Dance+ subscription. I shouldn't be bombarded with that every time I play after buying the dang game.",
                "10": "I initially thought the code for the extra content came in-box but it doesn't. It gets emailed to you after it ships. I see all the reviews claiming they were lied to. They weren't. They just didn't check their emails. Also I love the fact that Just Dance 2024 adds on its content to 2023. No more clunkiness. But I do want them to add back battles and World Dance Floor."

This cutting-edge virtual reality headset has completely transformed the way I interact with games, movies, and even social experiences.

The lightweight design, ergonomic straps, and soft facial interface provided a comfortable fit even during extended gaming sessions. Additionally, the adjustable IPD (interpupillary distance) settings ensured that I could fine-tune the headset for a custom fit, enhancing the overall comfort and visual experience.\n\nThe Meta Quest 2's Touch controllers are a joy to use. They are incredibly responsive and intuitive, mimicking my hand movements with impressive accuracy. From wielding a virtual sword to manipulating objects in the virtual world, the controllers effortlessly translated my actions into the game, creating a sense of true immersion and control.\n\nThe wireless nature of the Quest 2 is a game-changer. No more tripping over wires or being tethered to a PC; the freedom to move around without any constraints elevated my gaming experience to a whole new level. With its built-in tracking capabilities, I could explore vast virtual worlds without being tied to a specific spot.\n\nThe Quest 2's library of games and experiences is vast and continually growing. From thrilling action titles to captivating exploration games, there's something for every gaming preference. The Meta platform also offers a social space, allowing me to connect with friends and family in virtual reality, bridging the gap between gaming and social interaction.\n\nSetting up the Meta Quest 2 was a breeze. The guided setup process and user-friendly interface made it easy to get started quickly. The headset's integrated guardian system helped create a safe play area, preventing collisions with real-world objects while I was fully engrossed in my virtual adventures.\n\nIn conclusion, the Meta Quest 2 is a game-changing virtual reality headset that has transformed my gaming experience. Its stunning visuals, powerful performance, and comfort-enhancing design immerse me in virtual worlds like never before. With its vast library of games and social interaction features, the Quest 2 has become an essential part of my gaming setup, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their gaming experience to new heights.\n\nPros:\n- Stunning high-resolution display with vibrant colors\n- Powerful performance and smooth gameplay\n- Comfortable and customizable fit\n- Intuitive and responsive Touch controllers\n- Wireless design for unrestricted movement\n- Expansive library of games and social interaction features\n\nCons:\n- Limited battery life during intensive use\n\nOverall, the Meta Quest 2 deserves its place at the forefront of the VR gaming revolution, and it has undoubtedly earned its spot as a flagship device in the virtual reality market.",
                "2": "I hate how my local gym canceled the Les Mills Body Combat classes on the days i can go, but I like how I can now take the classes on Meta Quest 2 in subversive VR. I work up a sweat and can choose as many workouts as I want. So I don't even miss the class at the gym being taken away! This is awesome!\n\nOn another note, being first submerged into the VR world, I was amazed and it took my breath away. I didn't know where to begin, but it did have a great tutorial that took place within my own \"house\" environment.\n\nThere are soooooooo many games and apps and things to do and see, a lot of it free, it is hard to figure out what to try and do. I love how YouTube VR has totally 360° videos and VR videos thar border on creepy how realistic they can be. One lady rubbed latex gloves by my ears and it felt real and raised the hairs on my head and body as she played a tuning fork while doing this \"reiki\" healing. Idk if it is real Reiko, but it felt so real, it was just mindblowing.\n\nAnother video showed what sleep paralysis (which I do have sometimes) is like, and while it isn't entirely what I've experienced, some parts are very much scary how real they felt, esp the end of the video.\n\nThere's VR social worlds, as you can design your avatar to look like you or whatever version of yourself you want to be. I gave myself purple hair! I was sad to see the skin color choices were all realistic and no green or purple or red, lol. So it sort of forces you to look like a regular person, even if you can buy cheap outfits of role play and fantasy style stuff like queen of dragons or samurai outfits. In your home, you have a mirror to show you what you look like and you can change it anytime.\n\nSometimes you see other people and wonder what you look like to them. But it doesn't matter. It's all fun to see other people that are real also playing games or Body Combat alongside you and against you vying for first place. It makes it more fun!\n\nI haven't tried the chat world's or social meetups, but I don't know where to begin.\n\nThis can consume one's daylight hours easily just exploring where to begin or finding favorite games to play. Some are pricey, but even I paid whatever for Body Combat, as it was well worth it.\n\nEverything had Bern amazing so far, and as someone with kids and taking online classes, I don't have much free time to explore worlds, and i have to watch the virtual watch on my wrist to keep track of time or set an alarm on my phone to remind me to do things before it's too late, lol.\n\nSo far, this has been an amazing purchase. I saw it at CostCo and looked it up and saw Amazon had it cheaper, and I could make 5 monthly payments for it, so I went with buying it on Amazon.\n\nYou can take photos, but I can't find them to post here. You alsoncan use your microphone to voice commands or talk to people or bots or just issue commands to change how things look or appear.\n\nI can't even begin to sum up how amazing this stuff is, but I did try! Worth every dollar I paid for sure. And now the Quest 3 is coming out at over double the cost. I can't imagine it getting better than this, but the headset can be stuffy esp when working out and sweating 😅 so i hear the Quest 3 will help fix that and make a thinner headset etc. And no more rounded controllers.\n\nYou can make boundaries for your world and be warned if out of bounds so you don't knock into things like chairs, beds, plants, cables, other stuff. And I have one set up for when I'm in bed! Some are made for lying down and sleeping. It's crazy.",
                "3": "I feel like the guy from \"Ready, Player One\" with this! When you put it on, time flies, so I'm glad the battery doesn't last forever (a couple hours)! It's dangerous if you're using it plugged in, because with unlimited power, you can easily stay up all night! So much to see and do, through the online web browser and all sorts of games and apps. I signed up for Supernatural and am working out every day - endless workout routines and music playlists to choose from! I also connected with a long-distance friend and had his avatar sitting in my virtual home chatting with me, and playing games with me - so awesome! Also signed up for the monthly Meta+ membership to get 2 new curated games every month. Can't wait for the mini golf next month to play with my friend! Also love the meditation apps, TRIPP, Maloka, and Liminal, and I'm not into meditating, but the music and visuals are so awesome and relaxing! A great way to get refreshed after a workout or wind down before sleeping. Options are endless on this thing and I'm so glad I finally took the plunge - well worth the money! I also bought the Kiwi Comfort Elite strap which is more comfortable and easier to adjust the fit than with the standard strap, and I got cloth covers to absorb sweat when exercising.",
                "4": "I had a mastectomy and bought this as a way to help me get my range of motion back, and OMG, it is so much fun!! There's so much to do and see. I didn't realize that some of the exercise programs and other games cost extra or need a subscription, so that kinda stunk, but there is definitely plenty to do for free, including exercise! I was sweating in less than 8 minutes. If you just want to unwind, there are wonderful places to explore. One bad thing is the battery is short-lived. This saves me, otherwise, I might be on it for too long day and night. Still, a longer battery would be good. Also earbuds so others don't have to listen to our games. I can't wait to see how this gets improved upon in the future. Like how we used to have giant wireless phones at one point...lol. I'm not a huge fan of how AI is writing for us and we can't hardly tell an AI person from an actual human, but if we can keep a healthy balance of real life vs virtual reality, this could be great! Very fun, and the exercises are really fantastic. The whole thing is mind-blowing to me.",
                "5": "I got this initially for Beat Saber and branched out to other games. I did get an aftermarket head-strap and sport facial interface.\n\nDespite a very strong eyeglass prescription, progressive lenses and a pupil distance between the clicks I have clear vision in VR and experience no dizziness or nausea.\n\nSeveral friends have tried it and enjoyed it.",
                "6": "After 2 days the band cracked and now it doesn’t work like it should . He lives it and all the features but for it to crack and replacement is 70 it’s just to much cost .",
                "7": "OMG, this is a life changer! Until this week, I haven't played video games since Atari and then later, Ice Breaker. That's it. I just wasn't interested. Then... I saw an advertisement for this product and getting fit by having fun. That did it. I put it off because of the cost but I finally got it. I am SO not sorry. Right now, I'm playing solo games (and of course, on easy mode) BUT I play multiple times a day. I love VR and I haven't experienced any vertigo or dizziness that others report. It's a little blurry because of my eyesight (farsighted in one eye and near sighted in the other) but prescription lenses are available through VR Optician so I think the blurriness will be much better once I get the new lenses. If you haven't experienced VR yet, or you want to get active without \"working out\", I recommend you give this a try. I think you'll love it as much as I do. And, FYI, you aren't \"watching\" a screen, this is a 360 degree, interactive experience. Happy gaming!",
                "8": "The storage of the Oculus Quest 2, like any gaming console, uses up a healthy chunk of its storage for required software: 11. 3GB, to be exact. Plus, it comes pre-installed with a few demos and First Steps tutorials, but those can be uninstalled if you wish, freeing up a few hundred megabytes. You get a little over 116GB of actual storage with the 128GB Quest 2, while the 256GB Quest 2 has a whopping 245GB left for games storage! Gamers who might want to be future-proof could still consider the 256GB version, but the $399 price makes it less affordable for most. The original Oculus Quest 256GB version didn't make much sense to spend extra money on because original Quest games used to average around 1-2GB in size. These days, the best Quest 2 games now hover around the 8-12GB range for many titles.\nThe Oculus Quest 2 is very cool technology. It is not as cool as the technology in Sword Art Online, but you will not be fighting for your life while being stuck in the game. The headset is a bit on the heavy side but comfortable. The straps are quickly be adjusted front-to-back and side-to-side for the best fit. You can also use a spacer to make extra room for glasses. Most size glasses should fit fine in gear, but oversized frames will not. The hand controls are easy to learn and easy to use. The feedback is excellent, and I have not had trouble with lag. The system as a whole is very responsive. The speakers and microphone are apparent. The OS is very user-friendly, and the system walks you through many tasks when first set up. The audio controls even understand my slurred English. Speakers are built into the headset’s strap supports, offering directional left and right stereo sound. They’re reasonably clear and loud enough to get across your games' drama and directional audio feedback while keeping your ears free to allow you some awareness of your physical surroundings. If you’re playing in a room with a friend, they’ll hear everything going on using the built-in speakers, but there’s also a 3. 5mm jack if you want to connect your headphones for a private session. A decent set of stereo speakers are built into the side arms of the strap and produce immersive positional audio. If you want to be isolated, you can plug a regular set of headphones or earbuds into the headphones socket on the side of the headset, but I liked being able to hear a little bit of the natural world as I played. Definitely worth the purchase!",
                "9": "Let me start by saying that this headset is really awesome for the price. There's just not any VR headsets out there in this price range, and this is a decent one by any standard. That's for sure. I 100% recommend it. My kids and I have had a blast with it. There's fun for the whole family. Even my 4 year old can sit and ride roller coasters, despite barely being able to hold the controllers.\n\nThat said, there are a few things that could be improved, and unfortunately the latest version of the Quest is double the price of this one (too much for my blood):\n-Screen casting. So yesterday I had the option to screen cast to the TVs on my network. Today? Nope. Now it says to cast to my phone and mirror to the TV. Literally overnight they took away a great feature. What the heck?? I searched the internet and there are others saying the same thing. I hope they bring it back soon. It's great to share your experience with others or help your small kids through things.\n-Weight/comfort. This thing is pretty heavy to have on your face for a long time. It can be difficult to get it to fit comfortably with the OOTB strap. They skimped a bit on the straps for sure. I've ordered a better strap and hope it helps with comfort.\n-Battery life & charging cability. They say the battery lasts 2 hours, which I question, but even 2 hours seems like nothing on a weekend where all of the kids take turns on the headset nonstop all day. So I hooked up a 15' USB charging cord (which you have to buy seperately, mind you), but the charging is still just barely able to keep up to the power draw on a 2 amp charging block (total 10 watts of charging). So you better be sure you don't accidentally yank that USB cable out of the wall.\n\nI'm ordering a QC3.0 charger (a 3 amp charger) in hopes that it helps (people on the internet say it can charge up to 15 watts on the Quest 2) with a 15' cable that is rated for 30 watts to ensure I don't have a bottle neck in my cable. A 50% boost in charging speed would be great. It's a shame that they didn't design it to just use a barrel plug w/ an AC adapter, which could give you way more power than a standard USB-C connection. Plus you wouldn't have to worry about making sure you have the correct (and expensive) USB cables and adapters, which would still be the case even if they used high-wattage PD power delivery. I hate being constrained by batteries, and even more so by batteries and slow chargers.",
                "10": "OMG THIS WAS MY BEST PURCHASE OF 2023. I didn’t know how much I was missing not having a VR for myself and gaming. This was a life changer. From traveling the word to dungeon diving against goblins and skeletons the Meta Quest 2 can do it all. I bought to get into VR after hearing about the Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro. I love playing games but YouTube and other apps are the cherry on top. I recommend it for anyone wanting to get into VR, I think it’s a great intro"

                "1": "Spider-Man 2 for PS5 is an incredibly immersive, enjoyable gaming experience. Despite some criticism surrounding its purportedly 'woke' themes, I opted to separate my political viewpoints from my gaming experience. In doing so, not only was I able to appreciate the game, but it genuinely exceeded my expectations.\n\nThe narrative construction corresponds to some of the most seamless and fascinating Spider-Man adaptations I've encountered across various mediums, be it television series, films, graphic novels, or even other video games. The compelling story intertwines effortlessly with the gameplay, making it a truly gripping depiction of the Spider-Man universe.\n\nThe gameplay, brimming with action sequences, engaging combat mechanics, and authentic Spider-Man mobility, is yet another impressive aspect of the game. It not only offers a fun, immersive playthrough but also promises high replay value with enough content and varying difficulty levels to keep you coming back for more.\n\nWhile there are minor glitches here and there, they do not detract significantly from the overall gameplay. And rest assured, in their constant efforts to improve user experience, Sony will likely be implementing patches in the future to rectify these glitches.\n\nIn terms of graphics, the game offers rich, crisp, and detailed visuals that take full advantage of the PS5's powerful hardware. The painstakingly crafted and vividly realized world of New York City, from its towering skyscrapers to its bustling streets below, is eye-catchingly beautiful.\n\nThe voice acting and score further enrich the game's cinematic quality. From the spectacularly realized characters to the dramatic orchestral music, every element adds to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nAll in all, Spider-Man 2 is a phenomenal addition to the PS5 lineup, encompassing a potent blend of gripping story, engaging gameplay, admirable graphics, and excellent audio design. It's a well-rounded gaming experience worth exploring, regardless of your politicial stance.",
                "2": "Great story, great animations, great graphics. I mean this game is a huge step up from Spider-Man and Miles Morales in terms of graphics. This is like when you played beat em ups on NES then switched to SNES and the character sprites were bigger, beefier and looked so much better. That is the best way I can describe this. The addition of new traversal techniques are welcome and really add fun to moving around NYC.\n\nSpeaking of NYC, the map has been added to making it even more huge, they added Queens and Brooklyn and a couple other areas. I'm not from NYC, so I'm not that familiar with them. Fast travel is really cool, I mean, I'm not a fast travel person, but I had to try it out once and it's silky smooth, and there is no loading!\n\nThe story is great! Really tugs on the heart strings and Peter and Miles are great playing off each other. I don't want to spoil anything about the story because I went in blind and I was completely floored by the story and where it went. Just know it's fantastic!\n\nOverall, this is the best PS5 game this year and you should already own it. It took me about 28 hours to get the plat on Spectacular difficulty, and you only have to play it once to get the plat (but I'm sure you'll be playing it over and over). The only downside is that there isn't any NG+ stuff, like not even a NG+ mode. There isn't any reason to play this in NG+ like there was with Spider-Man and Miles Morales. Although I heard they are adding a NG+ mode by the end of the year, but I don't know why if there isn't any incentive to replay the game.",
                "3": "I am still exploring all the game has to offer me. But this is an improvement on the first game on many levels.\n\nThis time around we get to play and switch between 2 heroes: Miles Morales and Peter Parker.\nEach of them has unique abilities. Miles has abilities that revolve around his venom abilities, and Peter relies on his gadgets which can change gameplay and keep things fresh.\n\nYou also have the return of side activities and pop-up crime that help you gain exp and resources to upgrade your gear and suits.\n\nOne new thing for traversal is gliding, you gain access to this right in the beginning which makes exploring the city so much more fun.\n\nStory wise it is a classic spiderman tale. I haven't played through it all but I can see a very promising setup that is bound to be a whole rollercoaster.\n\nDo you need to play the previous games?\nI recommend that you at least play the first insomniac spiderman game. The game offers a recap but a lot of call backs and nuance will be lost if you hop right into this game. On the other hand, you can completely skip the Miles Morales game and play this one. The Miles Morales game is only about 8 hrs of story which this game gives you a good recap of. Plus maybe skipping it will offer some more \"freshness\" to playing Miles in this game.\n\nCons:\nThis game at its core retained a lot of what made the first game great. But it can feel repetitive. Combat as usual is not so much challenging but a mashing of buttons against enemies that soak up damage to different degrees depending on how \"tough\" they are. When the game tries to challenge you, it does so by throwing enemies that block you or try to overwhelm you with numbers which after a few fights can get cumbersome. The fights are definitely more enjoyable as Miles. At least for me.\n\nThere is some grind to this game, but only if you want to unlock everything and get every activity done. And I recommend at least unlocking skills because otherwise, combat will get even more stale.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are beautiful\nThe swinging and traversal of the city is fun and so spot on.\nStory is intriguing and the character switching is fun and freshens up the gameplay\n\nNow, is the game worth $69.99? Sadly, not to me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it is a fun game and if you liked the previous games and you enjoy Spiderman/Marvel you will like this game. You have a lot of gameplay and a lot of content to find and explore but when I looked it up the campaign averages 18-20 hrs without the side activities. When you include the side stuff you are looking at 30 hrs of gameplay. Unless you pursue a completionist gameplay then you are looking at 40 hrs (estimated)\n\nBut the content is not enough to warrant the not-so-new price increase of video games. If you are really excited about the game, you can buy it at full price. But honestly, I would wait for a sale if you can. Holidays are right around the corner afterall.",
                "4": "This is easily the best Spiderman game ever made. The story is the best Insomniac has ever written, and the characters each have an arch that develop them over the course of the story. Every character is developed and by the end of the game they are different.\n\nThe traversal is 2-3x faster than the first Spiderman on PS4 and Miles Morales, momentum plays a much larger role in web swinging causing you to traverse much farther and faster when it’s built up.\n\nThe new powers for Peter bring him up to the level of Miles with powers, and the Spider legs are also a nice addition adding new special moves that can clear out enemies in droves. The new web line lets you take out multiple enemies at once in stealth and is a perfect addition to the game. There are a substantial amount of enemies thrown at you in each fight and this makes the combat even more challenging. Enemies have new attacks that can knock you out of the air, forcing you to adapt.\n\nThe boss battles are revamped and boss battles require much more attention. Bosses also have health bars now which makes them feel more traditional. The new parry mechanic forces you to block attacks that you cannot dodge, adding a layer of depth to them that will challenge you more. Some attacks can only be dodged, while others can only be parried. The boss fights are also much grander in scale while also more of them are thrown at you than in the previous 2 titles.\n\nThe side mission in SM2 are also much better than the previous 2 games (Howard the pigeon collector mission stands out at one of the best in the game and it is a side mission). Certain crime activities feel stale, such as stopping cars and fighting arsonists, but only a limited amount of these need to be done to 100% the game. More variety in this area would be nice, but this is not that important in the grand scheme of what the game offers.\n\nOverall, this game is the first true “next generation” game all around with graphics, performance, fast travel, and super fast traversal. It is a showcase for what the PS5 Was designed for, and nothing on the market quite touches the stellar 60fps with ray tracing in an open world that loads as fast as this. This is a generation defining game that will be revered for years to come.",
                "5": "I recently dove into the web-filled world of Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 for the PS5, and let me tell you, it’s a spectacular experience that swings above and beyond its predecessor!\n\nFrom the moment you put on the Spidey suit, the upgraded graphics on the PS5 shine, delivering stunning visuals that capture the essence of New York City like never before. The cityscape is alive with vibrant details, and the fluidity of both Spider-Man’s movements adds a layer of realism that’s truly breathtaking.\n\nOne of the standout features is the enhanced combat system. Insomniac has managed to blend the smooth acrobatics of Spider-Man with a more intuitive combat interface. Combining punches, kicks, and web-based attacks feels incredibly natural, providing a satisfying combat experience that keeps you engaged throughout. It’s the closest I will ever feel to being Spider-Man!\n\nThe storyline is another highlight. Insomniac weaves a compelling narrative that delves deeper into Spider-Man’s world, introducing new characters and unexpected twists(no spoilers). The emotional depth of the characters adds a layer of authenticity that elevates the overall gaming experience.\n\nWeb-swinging has always been a defining aspect of Spider-Man games, and Insomniac nails it once again. The seamless transition between swinging, wall-running, gliding, and acrobatics makes traversing the city a joy.\n\nI also appreciate the attention to detail in the side missions and activities. They’re not just filler content; each one contributes to the overall narrative and rewards players with valuable upgrades and insights into Spider-Man’s world.\n\nIn summary, Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 for the PS5 is a must-play for any fan of the web-slinger. It successfully builds upon the foundation of the first game, delivering a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and thoroughly enjoyable experience. Whether you’re swinging through the skyscrapers or facing off against iconic villains, this game truly captures the essence of being Spider-Man. Highly recommended for both fans and newcomers alike!",
                "6": "A great Spiderman game with outstanding visuals and some appreciated gameplay mechanics. The story is well written and enjoyable. Many gripes hold me back from giving this a solid 5 stars. We've seen the same moves and abilities with some fresh tweaks but over time the combat is going to feel a bit boring since it is recycled from previous games. What makes me dislike the game is the boss encounters, it's too overwhelming having to take more than 5-10 minutes to go on 3 rounds fighting the bosses. I played this in spectacular difficulty so you’re going to be sitting there for a while just to proceed through the main story. Another thing I dislike is the glitches, after installing the game. $70 is a hefty price tag when some scenes aren't rendered properly or the game just crashes because of the bugs. I've had multiple issues with the framerate frequently dipping completely taking me out of the immersion. Last but not least the story is unforgivably short took me less than 5 days to complete again $70 I would expect those hours of playing to be worth the money but to me, it falls short, yeah there are sides missions, and activities but they feel boring after a while since it’s the same thing over and over.\n\nI would wait for a sale if you’re looking to buy the game.\n\n4.3 out of 5 - Good 👏",
                "7": "I might be biased as a Spider-Man fan since the age of 4. Which was 1982, and this game is pure superhero power fantasy excellence. I am having so much fun swinging and flying through NYC. It’s fast, smooth and slick. The same with the combat. Insomniac has really captured what you think it would feel like to be one of the Spider-Men.\n\nThe #1 pro for this game is the story. It is the best Spider-Man story that Marvel Comics refuses to tell. Specifically, it does what the comics won’t, and it allows Peter to grow up. It’s what the fans have mostly wanted to see with the character for years now, instead of the state of arrested development that Marvel seems to have wanted to keep him in over the past 20 years. It has solid character development, and rewards you for having played the two previous games. While Peter and Miles are Spider-Man, they are their own characters, with their own backgrounds that makes them who they are. It’s what makes this game the perfect package of great gameplay, great graphics and a great story.",
                "8": "Great game. Awesome sequel.\n\nAbout as long as the original Spider-Man. Playing as both Peter and Miles is so sick. There's like a million different costumes. The fast travel in this game is some sorcery.\n\nBoss battles are the best in the series. Game gets a little tough. I'd say upgrade your health and damage abilities early. I got a buncha costumes and kinda regretted it later.😣\n\nStory is solid, much like the first game. Kraven and, later, Venom make for standout villains. The biggest turn being Peter in the symbiote suit. Reminds me of the Otto/Peter dynamic.\n\nOnly real problems being launch day glitches. Those can solved in a patch. Also, if you don't feel like paying full price, don't. There is no shame in waiting for a price drop. 5/5",
                "9": "I was really looking forward to this game, and for the most part I got the improved gameplay I was hoping for. There are added traversal options for web swinging, and you also have web \"wings\" that let you glide all over both boroughs. You'll find yourself zipping all over the city much faster than in either the first Spider-Man, or Spider-Man: Miles Morales.\n\nYou can also unlock Fast Travel as before, and it is MUCH faster. No more subway cut scenes. Once you've unlocked the option for that area, pick it on the map and you're there in a few seconds, mid swing or glide.\n\nThe game looks amazing either in Fidelity or Performance mode. In both ray tracing is present, though of course done better in Fidelity mode.\n\nYou play as both Peter and Miles. Most of their supporting casts are back and I like all of those characters for the most part.\n\nThe one character I sometimes don't like is MJ. Most people didn't want to play as her again and instead of listening to that, Insomniac chose to give us more missions as her. They did try to make them more action oriented, but for me they came across as bit too unbelievable even for a superhero game. I was disappointed with them.\n\nI also felt that the writers went out of their way to malign Peter Parker, partly to help prop up Miles, which wasn't necessary. Miles is already fine on his own, he didn't need them to tear down Peter. We also have Peter doubting himself, diminishing himself at times. Once you pick up on this it tends to stick out. It's especially bad during one of the last missions. There's some dialogue that just made me shake my head.\n\nThere are some side missions that people have been complaining about.\n\nThe one mission with Miles' girlfriend, I didn't think it was so bad. It slowed the game down a bit and probably should have been optional, but I wasn't put off by it.\n\nThere were other missions and certain imagery that annoyed a lot of people. I don't think I should get into those here, though.\n\nI unlocked the platinum trophy in about 36 hours, and for much of that time I did not use Fast Travel, and I did some goofing off and messing around, not focusing on anything specific. If you're just looking to do the story, you're looking at maybe 12-15 hours, and that's being generous.\n\nYou don't need to play on Ultimate difficulty to get trophies or anything. You beat the game, and get the option to play on Ultimate for seemingly nothing other than the challenge.\n\nI enjoyed this game overall, but I worry a bit about what they will do with Peter Parker in the next game. The Wolverine game will also take place in this universe, and I worry that Insomniac is veering off course and we may get a Logan that is somewhat neutered as they prop up maybe Laura(X-23), or some other character. I hope I'm wrong. I hope they do Wolverine justice and stay focused on him and his journey, and I hope it's a violent one with nothing held back.\n\nIf you haven't picked up this game yet, you may want to wait for a sale. At $70, it might not be worth it to you. You'll have fun, but you'll probably put it down a lot sooner than you're expecting.",
                "10": "I really enjoyed this game, yet after 100% completing the game I never felt an urge to replay it or try something within it. The story is surprisingly well-executed for what could have been messy and quite cliché/done before. The web-swinging is leaps and bounds ahead of what it was... but, it will never quite match up to Web of Shadows for me, which had the complexity and moveset to just... you would never get bored swinging, there were always new things to try, and well, unlike turning off the swing assist in this game, it didn't feel arbitrary. I also like that it used actual pendulum physics (yes you can now do 360's swinging with a skill but it's not the same). Anyway, that aside, combat is... sigh. I feel like although some of the combat, like the L1 moves are refreshing, I find it stupid that they removed the old gadget wheel. Guys, just add the new stuff with the old stuff. Minor thing but I feel like they also nerfed the perfect dodge mechanic that would give you immediate takedowns. These might sound like minor things but they made the combat feel like annoying slogfests instead of graceful encounters where you can dispatch enemies far more quickly. I also will miss the double-takedown-per-focus-bar skill. This is a \"harder\" game than the titles before, especially if you play on hard mode, but again, I think a lot of it comes down to the features they removed instead of enemies or mechanics they added. Also, definitely not a big fan of the parry feature, like it's fine but it just doesn't belong in a Spider-Man title I feel like. Final words, you will probably enjoy this game, I know I sure did. I think 70 bucks for a game is overpriced but it's more up to you whether it's worth to wait for a sale or not. I will just say that my favorite game from Insomniac is still Sunset Overdrive and I don't think that'll change anytime soon with the corporate way they've gone."

                "1": "I recently purchased the Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller, and it has completely changed my gaming experience. As someone who loves playing games on the Nintendo Switch, I've always been a fan of the Joy-Con controllers that come with the console, but I found them to be a bit too small and cramped for extended gaming sessions. That's where the Switch Pro Controller comes in.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the controller was how comfortable it is to hold. The grip is smooth and ergonomic, and the buttons are placed in a way that makes them easy to access without feeling like you're reaching too far. The controller also has a good weight to it, making it feel substantial in your hands without being too heavy.\n\nOne of the standout features of the Switch Pro Controller is its battery life. I've used it for hours on end without needing to charge it, which is a huge improvement over the Joy-Con controllers. And when it does need to be charged, it only takes a couple of hours to get back to full power.\n\nThe controller is also incredibly responsive, with no noticeable input lag. The buttons and joysticks have a great feel to them, and I've found that it's made a big difference in my gameplay. I'm able to be more precise with my movements and actions, which has helped me improve in games where accuracy is key.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller to anyone who spends a lot of time gaming on the Switch. It's a game-changer that will improve your experience and make your gaming sessions more comfortable and enjoyable.",
                "2": "I am using a switch for the first time after using the ps5 and dualsense controller for around a year, the joy cons and joycon grip were quite an uncomfortable transition. this controller fixes all of that! amazing battery life, great joysticks, good weight and overall just great product",
                "3": "This controller is a definite must-have for a switch owner. Especially for people who have problems with the switch Joy-Cons. It's comfortable in the hands, the response times are excellent, the analog sticks are far better quality, and everything overall is far better than what you get out of the Joy-Cons. Not a single thing I dislike about it so far.",
                "4": "I own XBOX ONE, Series X and I am familiar with XBOX controllers, and they are probably the best ones you can have. Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is AS GOOD as XBOX Series X, it's absolutely amazing.\n\nPositives are:\n- It's very light and it will fit your hand perfectly\n- You would think it's low quality because it's 'very light' but it's not - it's very robust, hq build.\n- Buttons are amazing, they are big and will register every possible input. It's a joy to press them\n\nI am hoping to get some money to buy another one soon :)",
                "5": "A little pricey but looks, feels, and performs great. Classic Nintendo.",
                "6": "Good Nintendo brand alternative to the joy cons. I’ve dealt with joy con drift before with my regular joy cons. I haven’t experienced drift with this controller. It’s nice to hold in your hand. It has a long battery life. It is overall a good controller and would recommend it to any casual gamer.",
                "7": "*UPDATE*\n\nAfter a day with the controller, I decided to call Nintendo's customer support. They ran me through the typical home diagnostics (update system/controllers, perform \"input test\") and then recommended I send in the controller for repair. So I sent it in.\n\nWithin a couple weeks, I was opening the box they sent back, and the receipt said \"Service Performed: Product Replacement\". So I guess they just gave me a newer controller? (10 years ago I sent in a Wii, and they returned a replacement Wii, so I guess that's just how they often do it.)\n\nI loaded Puyo Puyo Tetris and tried out the controller in Tetris, and the dpad seemed to worked flawlessly. After playing some actual games, I feel like there is still some odd sensitivity that causes me to mess up a direction sometimes, but not like it did before. I will probably still play Puyo Puyo with the JoyCons.\n\nI'll leave my rating of the product at 4 stars, since it should have worked that well in the first place, but I am now very happy with my controller.\nI might want another one someday though, so hopefully this doesn't have to happen again.\n\n*END UPDATE*\n\nAfter reading about how the corded controllers tend to have 0-2 frames of input lag, and knowing that I'd rather not play most games with the joycons, I decided to get a pro controller along with my new Switch.\n\nNow, the only game I've played is Puyo Puyo Tetris, so I haven't really tested all the functionality of the controller (I'll play Super Mario Odyssey soon though), so I'm not sure about the quality of the control sticks or how well the trigger buttons work yet. But here is what I know:\n\nPros\nLooks really sleek ( I only see two screws; phillips head)\nCharging cable plugs into top of controller\nTriggers/bumpers have a bit more resistance than the Wii U gamepad bumpers, which were definitely too easy to press\nButtons are all pretty big, including dpad\nSmaller buttons (Plus, Minus, Home, and screenshot) are conveniently located within thumb reach\nEvery part of it feels good to touch\n\nCons\nCharging cable is USB, but only seems to work if plugged into the switch dock's USB port\nUp on the dpad is too easy to press\n\nSo that last point is really upsetting; in Puyo Puyo Tetris, you need to press dpad up a lot to instantly drop tetris blocks, but there is a high chance I will drop them accidentally whenever I press left or right on the dpad. Dpad down has significantly more resistance and I will never accidentally press that. For many games this might not be an issue, but I honestly think I'll have to use joycons for Puyo Puyo Tetris. It's not horrible, but I should be able to use this controller well for any game, so there's no way I can give it five stars.\n\nI will also note that I prefer to grip gamecube controllers with two fingers up on each hand (i.e. one each for L, R, ZL, and ZR), but this controller seems a bit less comfortable that way, probably because your middle fingers have less leverage, since the trigger buttons are smaller and not curved. However, the buttons are positioned such that having only one finger for two buttons is quite natural (more so than with joycons). Using only your index fingers is probably more ergonomic anyways.\n\nOverall I really like this controller. I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I've played Super Smash Bros. Melee competitively for a long time (which means I've gone through a lot of gamecube controllers, and often cleaned them/fixed them myself), and this controller feels like high quality hardware. I'm just really disappointed about the dpad up button being to easy to depress. Maybe other people/pro controllers don't have this problem, but it seems like something that shouldn't have been overlooked.",
                "8": "After getting duped by an eBay knockoff controller that when compared side by side looks 99.99% similar, it's a breath of fresh air to receive a controller that's 100% authentic. Everything works and it's worth full price.",
                "9": "He estado usando el control por alrededor de 3 semanas y de momento estoy satisfecho, tengo 2 controles imitacion y donde mas se nota la diferencia de calidad es en el Dpad, en el control original se siente muy bien al tacto y la cruzeta reacciona muy bien cuando presiono hacia el lado izquierdo o derecho (esto funciona muy mal en controles genericos chinos). No queda mas de otra que tratarlo con cuidado porque he leido que es muy comun el joycon driff lamentablemente (muy mal por nintendo aca). En lineas generales me parece un control excelente, muy bien construido y de alta calidad, no le doy las 5 estrellas por un posible driff que pueda sufrir en un futuro.",

And WHEW and i’m absolutely blown away!\n\nI do own a PS5 and i haven’t been the biggest fan of the new controller design. But for some reason, this dual sense edge does everything just right. From presentation, to aesthetic, to comfortability and longevity, this controller executes on all levels!!!\n\nNot only is it the easiest hookup to PC, i mapped the back paddles to the respective face buttons of my liking and adjusted the triggers so they respond like hare. Once the setup was done, i hopped on COD MW2 and went absolutely bananas on some donkey kong shi.\n\nNow mind you, I am an owner of the new Scuf Envision, the Scuf Instinct Pro, Flydigi 3, Xbox Series Elite 1 and 2, Victrix Gambit and then some. But for some odd reason, this bad boy feels the best in hand, the most responsive, the back paddles are easily assesible, and the quality is BEYOND ME.\n\nEXPECTATIONS EXCEEDED. Great job Sony!",

                "4": "I have never owned a pro controller before, and I didn't think I needed one till now. I play alot of Apex Legends, and Call of Duty. All I can say is, with this controller it has enhanced my performance by a ton! The controller compared to a regular dual sense, is that it is alot heavier. Design is a little bit different. It comes with extra back peddles, as well as joysticks. Also come in a really hard secured case for you to keep it safe at all times. I also use it on PC, which works great Wired, and works surprisingly well on wireless. Wired tho for best gameplay. Some people ask me how do I set up profiles for PC. Best way is if you have a PS5, you can set profiles within it. If you don't have a ps5 then tbh, this controller might not be for you. You could still use it on PC, but finding an app to remap buttons might be a little tough. Don't hesitate to buy this tho. Regardless of having a ps5 or pc this controller is a beast! Im sure there is some app you could remap buttons too and set profiles. This is a very well made controller!",
                "5": "Title: The Ultimate Gaming Experience: A Perfect 10/10 for the PS5 Controller!\n\nReview:\n\nI recently had the privilege of using the PS5 controller, and I am absolutely blown away by the incredible gaming experience it delivers. From its innovative design to its advanced features, the PS5 controller truly sets a new standard for gaming peripherals. Without a doubt, this controller deserves a resounding 10/10 rating for its exceptional qualities.\n\nFirst and foremost, the ergonomic design of the PS5 controller is a game-changer. It fits comfortably in my hands, allowing for hours of gameplay without any discomfort or strain. The textured grips offer excellent control, ensuring that the controller stays firmly in my hands even during intense gaming sessions.

These technologies elevate the gaming experience to a whole new level. The haptic feedback provides a remarkable level of sensory immersion, making each action in the game world feel more realistic and engaging. Whether it's the sensation of raindrops or the rumble of a powerful explosion, the haptic feedback truly draws you into the virtual world like never before.\n\nThe adaptive triggers, on the other hand, add a layer of depth to gameplay that I never knew I needed. The resistance they provide in different situations, such as drawing a bowstring or pressing the accelerator in a racing game, adds an extra dimension of realism and strategy. This innovation not only enhances immersion but also opens up new avenues for game developers to explore creative mechanics.\n\nAdditionally, the built-in microphone and speaker are convenient features that further immerse players in their gaming experiences.

Sony has outdone itself with this controller, pushing the boundaries of what a gaming peripheral can achieve. Without a doubt, the PS5 controller deserves a perfect 10/10 rating for its exceptional quality and contribution to the world of gaming. If you're looking to take your gaming to the next level, this controller is an absolute must-have.",

Even the built in microphone, while annoying at times, can be convenient if you dont always want to have a headset on like me (btw I really feel like the light should be on when the mic is on and off when the mic is off, the opposite of how it is, but what do I know?)\nThere are a suprising amount of bad modern controllers out there, but the dualsense is definitely a great choice even if you're not playing on ps5. Also know that its not built tough.",
                "7": "I love playing PC games with a hand controller. That's why I was excited to try the new Sony controller that has many amazing features. The controller comes in a beautiful box with all the accessories you need. It feels very premium and comfortable in your hands. Sony really did a great job with this product. But there are some drawbacks that prevent me from giving it five stars. The first one is the price. It is very expensive compared to other controllers on the market. I think only hardcore Sony fans would be willing to pay that much for a controller. The second one is the performance. It doesn't really live up to the hype. It has removable thumb sticks that you can replace if they get worn out or start drifting, which is a nice option. But I haven't had any problems with them so far. The controller works fine, but it doesn't make me feel like I have an advantage over other players. It's just a good controller, not a great one. So, I would recommend this controller to Sony enthusiasts who want to have the best of the best, but not to casual gamers who are looking for a budget-friendly option or a competitive edge.

I have gone through 3 until I finally upgraded for the Turtle Beach. Seriously, the money I spent on the cheap ones would have almost fully paid for this set.\n\nQuality sound all around. Its peak performance compared to other brands (including official xbox set). Best features:\n1. Two dials to control sound. One is for game volume and the other is for party volume. The second being my favorite feature when I don't want to hear heavy breathing or slurping on the other end lol.\n2. The microphone itself. Flipping up puts it on mute, reverse to talk again. Freaking awesome. Plus it can pivot towards your face if your voice isn't reaching for some reason.\n\nWorst feature:\n1. Pressing the power button a second time to get enhanced audio? Not sure if it works or not. I haven't really noticed anything. There is no risk of turning off the headset that way though, you have to press and hold for that, so that feature is great.\n\nI would say 4.9 but we can't get that precise with our review. I'd say this is a perfect set for anything you are doing game or streaming wise, especially if you have tinnitus.",
                "3": "Picked up directional items. It’s the previous earphones did not. Be careful in handling looks like it could break easily.",
                "4": "I’ve been a huge fan of Turtle Beach since a headset purchase back in 2016. Their materials are sturdy, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThis headset is good, but has a few caveats.\n- Not for big heads. I don’t have a big head, but that being said, this headset feels a bit snug even for me\n- Requires drivers and some setup. Otherwise your volume is either nothing or max with no inbetween\n- No mic cover included. I had some backups thankfully, but this is just a preference\n\nOtherwise I love this headset so far. The audio quality is pretty great and it handles bass enhancements well",
                "5": "I bought these for my partner and he is really loving them so far. I tried them on my xbox as well and they are definitely a great headset. Easy to use and comfortable for the most part. I had some squeezing towards the bottom of my ears, but that'll most likely will go away once my partner has broken them in. Definitely going to buy myself some next!",
                "6": "Very comfortable to wear for hours, battery lasts a while, and I like how you just have to flip the mic up to mute yourself. Sound adjustments are nice too, just wish it was slightly more user-friendly as there's times where I struggle to find a good balance between voice chat and game sound.",
                "7": "Love these headphones. They work great. I made the mistake of dropping my Xbox and breaking the reciever. Having a hard time replacing it. Otherwise great company. Excellent product",
                "8": "This headset is definitely an improvement from the stock wired headset I was using. The sound quality is great--you can really hear a game's ambience and music has good bass. My only issue is the sound/chat mixer. There's almost none. You either want to hear the game louder or your chat. There's no balance. Diablo IV sound mixing is a great example. You'd have to turn the game nearly all the way down, just to hear your party chat without hurting your eardrums.",
                "9": "I Bought these for my husband and these are probably the best pair I have purchased. Wireless connection works amazing, he can walk around the house and it'll stay connected, and the sound is phenomenal 5 out of 5 stars, I definitely recommend.",
                "10": "Everyone knows, Turtlebeach makes the best gaming headsets, hands down!! Hell, even my grandmother knows that, and she died when Atari was still a thing. Great wireless headset, and the price was very reasonable."

                "1": "At first I was kinda skeptical about buying this game since you know Ubisoft but I’m glad to say they didn’t mess it up like they do with everything they release. The game play is awesome I love the open world and the story so far is full of great memorable characters. This game rocks and I’m glad I got it what makes it better is that it was 14$.",
                "2": "Love this game! Super fun and got this product when it was discounted 75% off! Super great deal for the amount of hours of gameplay!",
                "3": "Great game and I would say an improvement on the first one. Has a bit more of a open world feel and you can explore and do certain puzzles not in order. However the overarching story is still there so to an extend you still have to follow the story line.\n\nTried to explain it to my 5 year old but it's definitely much harder than the first one to play, but there are a lot of handicap features that make it playable for him.\n\nRegardless, fun game, easy buy if it's under $30 bucks, well worth the value. Might not be worth it if it's over $30 given the fairly fast playthrough.",
                "4": "The gameplay is so much fun!",
                "5": "A fun and worthy sequel to the incredible Kingdom Battle game.\n\nPros: A little longer than the first at 55-60 hours to complete 100% of tasks (if it lets you.) Replaces the original's grid-based mechanics with a circular distance mechanism. The game is still based on a grid, but allows characters a bit more freedom of movement and shows distances in a circle surrounding the character to give a greater sense of realism.\n\nCons: Even less attached to the Mario series than the first game: Mario & Company could just as easily be replaced by more Rabbids with little loss to story. A rearrangement of the techniques used by characters in the first game makes some much more useful than others (particularly Rabbid Peach and Luigi.) No undo system this time, and once a jump or landing is performed (even if by accident) you are committed and a mistake can leave your character wide open to attack. The game also has a huge amount of bugs: both graphical, with lots of pop-in and plane shearing, and functional, with characters getting infinitely stuck alternating between two grid squares, the game randomly crashing after a targeted enemy is defeated (especially in the final battle), and one of the quests does not register as completed no matter how many times you do it. For a game that took many extra months of development and is now 3+ weeks from release without resolution, such bugs do not reflect well on Ubisoft or the latest version of the Snowdrop engine. Were it not for such obvious defects it would be worthy of a perfect score.\n\nSome have also complained that the Rabbids are now voiced (short two or three word fragments mostly) and have dialogue, but I didn't mind. It's explained in-game as improvements in Beep-Os translation system that has occurred since the events of Kingdom Battle.",
                "6": "I bought this game for my nephew who is 9 years old and a big Mario fan, it's a great addition to his Mario videogame collection.\nThe game itself is quite different to most Mario games, it require a little more of strategy and reasoning. I love the characters evolution during the progress of the game and how every character has their own special habilities.\nIt may not be the best Mario game, but still amazing.\nThe package arrived on time and in perfect conditions.\nDefinitely a great buy.",
                "7": "I bought this for my son's family for something to do when they visited us. My grandchildren range in age from 6 to 12. It didn't matter who was playing it at any given time, they ALL loved it (even the 12 year old, which in my opinion, is a big win!).

                "11": "Sparks of hope it is hads down a worthy sequel to the original. The change of mechanics can take a bit to get used to but gives you more freedom. And although I miss weapons upgrades VS just skins. However, the story is engaging enough to get past it and enjoy my time with this title."

                "2": "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the US Version is an absolute gaming masterpiece that lives up to its title as the \"ultimate\" fighting game. This game brings together an extensive roster of iconic characters from various video game franchises, creating a thrilling and action-packed gaming experience like no other.\n\nThe gameplay is fast-paced, fluid, and incredibly fun. Each character has a unique set of moves and abilities, allowing for diverse and strategic battles. Whether playing with friends locally or challenging opponents online, the game offers endless hours of entertainment and competition.\n\nThe attention to detail in the game is remarkable, from the meticulously designed stages inspired by classic video games to the faithfully recreated character models and animations. The visuals are crisp and vibrant, adding to the immersive gaming experience.\n\nThe game's sound design is exceptional, with a dynamic soundtrack that features remixes of iconic video game tunes. The audio enhances the excitement of battles and nostalgia for fans of the various franchises represented.\n\nOne of the most significant strengths of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is its replay value. The game's single-player modes, online multiplayer battles, and numerous unlockable characters and spirits ensure that players will keep coming back for more.",
                "3": "If you have ANY beef with someone who grew up with an N64, you take it out on this game.\nGreat multi player party game. Fighting might happen in real life if one person just wrecks everyone else. Emotions will get tested, tears possible, friendships might get ruined, but it is all worth it if you win the battle! You need ppl around you to sharpen your skills.",
                "4": "Nintendo once again does not disappoint! This one is just as fun and addicting as the last one, but with every character from every Smash Bros game that came before, this one upset the stakes. Fantastic game! Definitely one of the best ever made! Certainly the best Smash game in my opinion.",
                "5": "Pros:\nThe World of Light adventure mode is fantastic. Not only is it really fun to play with the addition of a progression system with the spirits, skill tree, and unlocking more fighters, but it also quite long and will take you many hours to fully play through. I actually quite enjoyed the spirit system and the many different spirit fights seem diverse enough that it doesn't really start to bore me. Maybe the only problem is the varied difficulty of fights. Most fights are insanely easy after you have a decent full leveled spirit, even on the highest difficulty, but you can always purposefully handicap yourself by using a weaker spirit if that's your thing. But also some of the fights were so insanely difficult and unfair that switching down to \"easy\" mode still made the fight take me 30 minutes of replaying to beat (and I'm pretty decent at the game). Honestly it wasn't even a downside for me I enjoyed the challenge and it wasn't a necessary fight for progressing.\nHuge character pool this time around. \"Everyone is here!\" Not an exaggeration over 80 characters will be on the roster after dlc and counting Pokemon trainer as multiple fighters. Obviously some of those are just slightly different echo fighters, but the diversity is still great. Just quick unlocking characters by restarting, unlocking, and restarting again took a long time. All the characters look great and feel great to play and play vs, though I haven't been able to use all of the extensively yet.\nI'm not a pro player by any stretch, but the fighting mechanics feel fluid and the engine seems well polished. I love that the heavy characters have been buffed by having their lag time for aerials and landing reduced. I like them making perfect shield harder/different as it will give pros something to develop skill wise as well. Hopefully the pro scene will be able to make something of this game as smash 4 was a bit of a let down (won't even talk about brawl).\nThey also made training mode better, and allow you to play the game while waiting for an online match, but many other parts of online are less than desirable.\n\nCons:\nOnline mode is kind of taking a back seat here. I was really hoping we would be getting a more fine tuned and more competition oriented online mode, but got the opposite. They made online mode a for fun system, which I understand is the direction Sakurai wants to take with the game, but I just don't understand why they couldn't have given their competitive community a bone here. Online match making no longer has a For Glory mode. There is simply casual mode with a matchmaking system that puts you up against someone near your skill level based on an elo system on a per fighter basis. It also matches you with some with a game rule similar to your own, but not exact.... this has made me go into what I thought was a 1v1 no items match into an assist trophy free for all nightmare. This is also going to continue to create debates as to what the \"official\" competitive rule set will be for 1v1 online play.\n\nOverall the game is a great experience and was definitely worth the purchase and worth the wait. Tons of replayablity and fun for all levels of players.",
                "6": "Definitely my favorite Smash Bros entry of the entire series. One could even say it's the \"Ultimate\" version of the game. It can be played for hours with friends and I've even enjoyed playing on my own, though that isn't quite as fun as playing with a group of friends and family.\n\nI will admit it can be a confusing game to jump right in to if you've never played a Smash Bros game before. However, it can be enjoyed by little kids and adults alike. Make sure to watch the \"How to Play\" video after the intro to the game to get a basic idea of how the game works. These games have a pretty unique take on the fighting game genre, so I'll leave a basic summary below.\n\nThe goal is to knock your opponents off the edge of the screen to reduce their lives. As you hit your opponent their percentage goes up. The higher that percentage is, the farther they will fly away when attacked. When a character is knocked out, they come back at 0% and continue battling until time runs out or they run out of stock/lives.\n\nEach character (there are 74!) has different kinds of moves, strengths, and weaknesses. There are multiple items, modes, and stages/levels in the game. The best way to learn it all is just to play. You'll quickly find characters you enjoy playing as and develop a fighting style that's all your own.\n\nI realize I haven't said much about the game yet, but there is so much going for it that it's hard to pick things out. The music, sheer number of stages and characters, and overall polish to the game is astounding. In terms of changes between previous versions of the game, some of my favorite things are:\n\n1) The physics of the game are the best so far. Its crisp, fast paced, and not as floaty as Brawl. Knocking people away, trying to get back to the stage, and performing combos just feels so fluid.\n2) Setting custom rulesets. I have my default 3 stock no items for 1 on 1 or true skill matches. I have a 3 stock all items high and smash meter on for the free for all party play. You can set the rules up whatever way you like and set a preset which makes getting in to play that much faster.\n3) Starting with the original 8 characters and unlocking all the new ones is actually really fun for me and never felt like a chore. Anyone complaining about this part must not remember what it was like to get Mewtwo (20 hours of vs matches) or Game and Watch (1000 vs matches) in Melee or Wolf in Brawl (450 matches). In this mode you get the chance to beat and unlock a challenger every 10 minutes of VS play, or even quicker if you reset the switch after every match. You also face a challenger every time you finish classic mode, or throughout the new Spirits mode in World of Light. It really is fun to watch the roster grow, and doesn't really feel all that grindy unless you are in a huge rush to unlock every one. If there is a character you really want, look up the charts that show you who unlocks who in Classic mode and you can have the character you want within 30 minutes easy.\n4) Slow-mo on knockout hits, extra damage in 1v1, the overlaid out of bounds box when someone went flying, and the smoke trailing characters matching their color are all huge quality of life improvements.\n5) Everything? I could go on and on. I love this game. Within a night of playing it was without a doubt my favorite game of the series.",
                "7": "Arguably, sometimes when it comes to gems for the Nintendo Switch, I sometimes head backwards & give them a chance rather than playing them at the moment. Arguably, I have been more of a light fan of the Super Smash Brothers series than a hard core one. I have played prior Super Smash Brothers games with the arcade fighting fun against the great foes like Master Hand & more updated characters like Ganondorf & Mega Man. Arguably, trying to head back into the franchise is definitely a challenge, but had some things that worked well, where others could've worked better. After finally getting to play Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate, I can finally say this is one of the best multiplayer games to master.\n\nSuper Smash Brothers: Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch is one of the best multiplayer experiences you can get, right behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. You have a lengthy amount of content here, where you match & play against as many as 80 characters like Sonic The Hedgehog, Kirby, Luigi, Mario & Wario. This game has a lot of great matches that you can play & stages that celebrate video games' past like Green Hill Zone from Sonic The Hedgehog, the Metroid underworld, where you're battling with Mother Brain in the background. There are many different multiplayer fights with 100 smash battle & custom traditional fighting arcade modes for each character in the arcade mode.\n\nBut where the game does shine, but truthfully shines too bright is the World Of Light adventure mode. Where you start as Kirby & he has to travel to unlock multiple fighters as you play the game to try & challenge the dark & light worlds where he can match against classic Smash Brothers foes like Crazy Hand, Giga Bowser & forgotten Nintendo enemies like Mark from the Kirby franchise & Dracula from the Castlevania franchise. The story feels kind of lightweight, where the content is good. I have found the game is fun, but could've been simplified in the end. Sometimes, navigating through the spirit trails can be frustrating & feels more like a exhaustion rather than a strength. But for easier gamers, you can simply tone down the difficulty to make your run though a bit easier. Graphically, the game looks great & has strong music to enjoy, but the control is easy to maintain, but can simply vary during challenges you play within the adventure mode. Still, multiplayer makes the control customizable & easier to maintain.\n\nThere are a few disadvantages with the game though. One of them happens to be the Word Of Light. The world looks great, but it doesn't feel as cinematic as prior Super Smash Brothers titles. I actually thought the subspace embessary from Super Smash Brothers: Brawl was a bit more engaging & compelling to play. Another disadvantage is in the level changer where you add fog, swap gravity & add partner foes to help win matches is honestly tedious & can change the matches drastically. When I found out that the stage made a flip upside down to the point that I had to perform the fight in a mirror style by making my controller go left, so I could make the fighter head right to where I could win a match. Arguably, it was very exhausting & caused me to feel drained in the end.\n\nWhether you have played Super Smash Brothers in the past, or other fighting games like Street Fighter V, there is a lot to play & have fun with while playing Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate. It is a great game, but more of a circus for excitement with matches with friends & contests. The single player adventure mode is a challenge that does work, but can quite easily drive you down rather than lift you up overall. Still, it is a step up from the failure of the Smash Brothers game on Wii U. So get yourself revved up out of your corner & fight.\n\nGraphics: B+\n\nSound: B 1/2+\n\nControl: B\n\nFun & Enjoyment: B- for solo play; B+ for multiplayer\n\nOverall: B 1/2+",
                "8": "This is the classic super fun Mario game. The whole family loves it. Highly recommend.",
                "9": "Let me begin by saying Super Smash Bros. has always been a fighting game franchise I've held dear since my childhood. Each new entry seemed to completely raise the bar, thereby raising my expectations for what kind of surprises were in store for us. And as far as the character reveals go, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate boasted a good amount of surprises for the fans. Lots of heavily requested fighters such as King K. Rool, Ridley and Simon Belmont finally graced the roster. However, I just don't see how they can call this the \"Ultimate\" version of Smash when so much was taken out in exchange for a larger than normal stage and fighter number. So this brings me to the ultimate question (sorry for the overuse of the word \"ultimate\" btw). Was what we gained better than what we lost? That's a difficult question for me to answer. Instead, I'll just spill my thoughts. Let's continue with the review.\n\nPart 1: Presentation. The formula of Super Smash Bros has remained relatively the same since its debut in 1999. Its control scheme is pretty unique for a fighting game. But, it works excellently. There are no 15-button combos, but a series of standard, special, and aerial attacks that can be used in whichever sequence you see fit. The objective of the game is to rack up damage on your opponents by beating them to a pulp using your wide variety of moves, items, assists etc. and then launching them off the stage. I simply adore the chaotic gameplay of Smash bros. and so do millions of people, hence the large fanbase. However, there are some people in this world who have never played a Smash game before (shocking, right?). I just feel the game could do a better job in presenting itself to newcomers. The \"how to play\" video doesn't show up until after the game's opening. How will people know to wait after the logo comes on the screen? Other than that, the menu is very clean and straightforward this time around. It only takes 3 button presses to get into a match with you and your buds. I also want to take this time and applaud the beautiful design of the menus. There is a nice mix between simplistic graphics and in-game images. It honestly deserves an award. Not only that, its easier than ever to add up to 8 players to a match, set up custom match rules and edit controller configurations. So much care went into making the experience pleasurable.\n\nPart 2: Gameplay. Like I mentioned above, the gameplay of Smash Bros. remained the same. But, this time around, the overall speed has been upped a bit, making the gameplay a tad faster than Smash 4, but a tad slower than Melee. And I gotta say, it really feels great. Since the speed of the game changed, so did some of the animations of the fighters. Taunts, for instance, are quicker and don't leave you vulnerable for as long. And when you launch a fighter, they propel a lot faster and a lot farther. This makes it a bit harder to execute combos, sadly. Despite the faster gameplay, I am AMAZED at how fluid the movements of the fighters still are, as well as how nicely animated some of their new moves are. This game runs at a buttery-smooth 60 fps, despite all the chaos happening on the screen. I'd give this game an A+ in this department. It's not hard to understand why the gameplay of Smash hasn't changed. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\nPart 3: Content. This is where things get dicey. One could argue that having 70+ characters and 100+ stage options qualifies as a hefty amount of content. However,a lot-and I mean ALOT of the features/modes from the prior smash bros. games have been cut. I'm going to start by telling you what you get with this game. There is your standard \"Smash\" mode, which houses local multiplayer matches. Standard Smash is for 2-8 players. If you have an even larger group of people wanting to play, you'll be glad to know there's a tournament mode. A new multiplayer mode called \"squad strike\" makes its debut in this game. In this mode, you can challenge a buddy and both of you use a \"squad\" of 3 or 5 characters to participate in elimination-style matches. Other than that, you can also mess around with the rules in the multiplayer matches. The mode \"special\" smash makes a return. Playing this mode, will allow you to fight with a variety of battle parameters (make your fighter faint after taking a certain amount of damage, make your fighters large, make them metallic, etc). Next, we have \"Spirits mode\", which houses this game's campaign mode, \"World of Light\". This could take a while to wrap up, so i'll try to be brief. Those of you who are familiar with Smash Bros may remember collecting \"trophies\" which are in-game collectible 3D models of characters who are both in and not in the game. In prior games, there were tons of ways you could unlock trophies, which added hours upon hours of more content. In this game, trophies are gone, but their spirits are carried through...well, spirits. The whole gimmick of \"Spirits mode\" is fighting,collecting and leveling up spirits, which are obtained by completing matches with a plethora of wacky parameters. So, what are spirits? They're basically the souls of characters who appeared in various games. In this game, they're represented by flat 2D images, rather than 3D models like the trophies were. When you \"equip\" a spirit, you attain its powers, which in some way, are related to the spirit itself. In super smash bros. brawl for wii, you may remember \"stickers\", which are almost the exact same thing, but you can't level them up. The whole mechanic of \"spirits\" is fully brought into play in the \"World of Light\" campaign mode. This time around, a new foe named \"Galeem\" has reared his ugly head and claimed the bodies of all the fighters (except Kirby) and is making clones of them. To make these clones fight, he uses the spirits he claimed from non-important characters and embeds them into the clones so that they become animate. Your job is to rescue all of your fallen comrades and restore light to the world. In this mode, you traverse a large, and I mean LARGE map, taking on the clones (with spirits inside them) in a variety of silly matches. Should you beat the clone at their own game, you free the spirit within and you can use their powers to help you free more spirits. Spirits are leveled up naturally by fighting. The better you do in a fight, the more EXP your spirit gets. Playing a good match can also net you \"skill points\" which can be used to unlock extra stats on top of the ones you get with spirits. When you travel across the map, you will run into your comrades being held captive. If you defeat them in a regular match, you will free them and that means you not only get to use then in World of Light, but in every other mode in the game as well. Each section of World of Light's map has a boss. Defeat that boss and you're one step closer to confronting Galeem. Anyway, you keep going through the cycle of fighting,rescuing spirits,rescuing fighters and taking down bosses for the whole campaign mode. I have yet to complete this mode, but it goes on for a while. My gripe with \"World of Light\" is that it becomes repetitive after a while. These matches with the crazy battle parameters make up about 90% of the campaign and are, in theory, just matches that you can replicate by messing around with the rules in \"Smash mode\". This honestly feels like event matches with an unnecessary rpg mechanic slapped on it. Also, the difficulty is all over the place. Some matches are fairly easy and in others, you'll get your can kicked to and fro. Anyhoo, let's keep going. Next, we have \"Classic Mode\", which is no stranger to us Smash fans. In this mode, you select a character, take on a series of matches and fight a boss at the end. However, this classic mode is a bit different than the \"classic\" modes we're used to. And by \"different\", I mean worse. First off, classic mode has been shortened by like 5 matches. Second, there is only one bonus game that you play between matches, and its the same for every fighter and every difficulty you choose. It's a little obstacle course where you collect yellow orbs and race to the end before a black hole swallows you. I just don't understand why they couldn't have at least added different layouts for the obstacle course. In prior games, there were \"break the targets\" bonus stages that had multiple layouts. Lastly, classic mode ends with a boss. **SPOILER ALERT IN 3...2....1...(SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED)There are only 6 bosses in the game. And in a game with over 70 characters, this means you'll be fighting the same ones over and over. And lo and behold, these are the EXACT six bosses you'll fight in the campaign mode.\n\n**SPOILERS OVER**Alright, next I want to cover the online mode. I knew from when it was first unveiled, it would be a mess and I was right. There is no longer the \"For fun\" and \"For Glory\" options that were in Smash Bros. for Wii U. There is only the Quickplay option in which you set your match preferences and HOPE you and another player have the same idea of a good match. More often than not, you will be forced to play in 4-player matches if you don't want to play 4-player matches and 1-on-1 matches when you don't feel like playing a 1-on-1. Also, there is noticeable lag (Oh boy, what a surprise) when playing online. Apparently, the game does its best to set you up against players close to you, but if one player has bad internet, everyone suffers.\n\nPart 4(UPDATED AS OF AUGUST 2019):The Cutting Board. This is where I want to talk about features than many considered to be standard for Smash games, but for some reason, don't show up in Ultimate. My main problem with this game is that I feel Nintendo stripped the extra content and modes that made Smash Bros. a truly enjoyable experience, leaving behind what the game is at its core: a party fighting game. Nintendo seems to be on this trend lately with games like Mario Tennis Aces, ARMS, Star Fox Zero and Mario Kart 8, where modes that offered a great subsidiary to the main gameplay formula (multiplayer modes, mini game modes, battle modes etc) that were present in PAST TITLES are nowhere to be seen. And I absolutely HATE that Smash had to be a part of this trend. And this most disappointing part of this is that the Switch is Nintendo's 2nd HD game console. We should be getting games that absolutely push the boundaries of what past games were restricted to. Other developers are making their sequels bigger and better, but for some reason, Nintendo is holding back content from their games. It just doesn't make sense. It's as if whenever they take 1 step forward, they have to take 2 steps back. Sorry for the small rant, here are the features that Smash Ultimate lacks. First, mini-games like \"Break the Targets\", \"board the platforms\" and \"Home run contest\" are absent. I feel these games would have been PERFECT for an online leader board functionality. Second, Single player modes like \"All-star\" and \"event match\" are absent.\nUPDATE: Stage Builder mode, which was a feature of the last 2 Smash games, was added via an update and it's amazing how much care went into designing the new components and objects you can play around with. This stage builder easily trumps the other two. Not only that, Tournament mode was added. I' ve decided to bump up my rating by one star to accommodate these additions. Thanks for listening to the fans, Mr. Sakurai.\n\nLastly, I want to talk about unlocking methods. You start the game with the original 8 characters that you started with in the Nintendo 64 game, yet all of the stages are unlocked. This baffling to me. In prior smash games, you would have to unlock stages and characters by completing certain requirements. Some of which were very unique and creative, making unlocking the character/stage a truly rewarding experience. With Ultimate, all of that is gone. You simply unlock characters by playing multiplayer matches, classic mode matches or via the \"World of Light\" campaign. If you want to bring back the nostalgic feel of putting effort towards unlocking something, you need to do it with the stages as well.\n\nPart 5: The verdict: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a truly great game at its core. Its gameplay has even been tweaked and refined, further enhancing the experience. However, most of what you'll be doing in this game is playing standard matches, whether it be against a CPU or a few buddies. Many of us were looking forward to a fully fleshed-out adventure mode, but its basically a series of event matches-something we've seen before. And all of the great passtimes like home-run batting, trophy collecting,\"break the targets\" or stage building are nowhere to be seen. And the one mode we do have that was present in past games, \"Classic\" mode has been watered down. By no means am I saying this is a terrible game. It's just that I was expected what added to the charm of Smash Bros. to be included in this installment. And I'm very well sure the developers know that we sometimes can't get everything we want. I don't feel ripped off, because there is very well $60 worth of content in this game. And with the addition of fan favorite characters like Banjo-Kazooie coming soon, I am very grateful to the dedication of the development team. Thanks for reading and happy gaming.",

                "1": "There’s more guns in this CoD than any before. The maps are from everyone’s favorite og 2009 game, but the visuals are much better. The gunplay is much better. It is very similar to last years offering MW2 2022, as was MW3 2011 was to MW2 2009.\n\nCall of Duty is one of those things that is best enjoyed while it’s happening, and when the next one comes you might ask yourself did I miss out on something? I’d say yes. This is the most refined Call of Duty to date, in terms of pure gameplay, visuals, cosmetic options, and 3 modes. The campaign is short if you’re not playing on Veteran, but I recommend playing on veteran or realism if you want the best experience.\n\nThe MP is the best part to me. To the kids that weren’t old enough for MW2 2009, you can finally see why this game was so special to us. Then there’s Zombies, which is like DMZ but PvE only. It’s very fun, albeit different from the more traditional round based zombies people are used to. Perk colas, wall buys and pack a punch are all here though, and despite it being MW3, you can still feel Treyarchs DNA in the mode.\n\nSo why is everyone so harsh on this game? I don’t know, but I’m not going to let it lessen my enjoyment of it. I’ve been playing MP since Call of Duty 2. I’ve played almost every single release. In the same way Fallout New Vegas is a more refined version of Fallout 3, the same can be said for this game and MW2.\n\nThis is sledgehammer’s best work by a long shot. They didn’t reinvent the wheel. They made a bunch of minor changes that change the flow and feel of the game from MW2. Recoil isn’t so crazy anymore, higher TTK, movement is the biggest change, much more similar to MW2019.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve felt like those old days back in 2009-2010 again, and I’m really glad the next generation can get to enjoy this. Aside from its kick ass campaign, I see no reason to go back to the original MW2.",
                "2": "So bear with me…..as I’ve been carrying something with me for a while and need to speak up. I've been a gamer since the Atari days.....I've owned pretty much every console and game known to man. Call me a COD fanboy if you want. The COD series has always been something I've looked forward to every November. Not lately. Actually, not since COD MW2 (the original) for its multiplayer and before that is was COD 4 for its campaign, easily the best two games in the franchise history. For those of you veteran COD players, you know exactly what I’m talking about. Every year since those days, it’s been well “maybe this year” they will get it right. We are so fed up!\n\nGone are the days of true side by side co-op, an engaging campaign, great MP maps, where it's actually enjoyable, playable and something you can’t wait to play again. The dev's and Activision seem hell bent on nickeling and diming you to death rather than focusing on developing a great game. I thought that MS acquisition of Activision would be better for the franchise but they have taken yet another step backwards.\n\nFirst, the game interface is confusing and everything seems to be hidden in an endless tree of options. Both for campaign and MP. Can I just get a simplified option to create a loadout that doesn’t involve a learning curve and the endless other options? Why does everything have to be so complicated?? Simplicity is what we want, when we start a game…not a headache.\n\nWant to play the campaign after loading your hard drive with 175Gb of data? Nope, have to download campaign packs 1 and 2 to play, another 25Gb. Why? Isn’t that why I bought the disc version? Shouldn’t this data be on the disc?? Last time I checked they can hold 100Gb of data. It’s infuriating.\n\nThe campaign from the outset feels like DLC at best. The frame rates are jittery, cinematics are full of lag and the gameplay feels like a pre-historic PS3 was brought in for beta testing. So much for utilizing the processing power of the PS5 like GOW Ragnarok did. Graphically, the worst COD ever. The story is boring, lacks any kind of depth for epic characters like Makarov, Soap and Ghost. I felt zero investment going through the campaign and instead did stupid things like......jumping off a cliff or high wire walking on a crane then sprinting and power sliding off the edge. Out of map area warning? I just keep running kamikaze style. Why? Because it was more fun than playing the game. Everything feels disjointed. For the first time in years, I feel like I've been fleeced. And these games aren’t cheap, never mind “DLC Packs” and other “Add-ons”. What an awful, embarrassing blow to the franchise.\n\nIf there is any saving grace to this game, it's that they brought back some of the most popular MP maps from MW2 that everyone has been asking for but the weapons and play feel much different from the original. But it's still nice seeing and playing those old maps.\n\nI genuinely feel bad about writing this review because I know how hard games are to make and how much time they put into them. But everything about this game feels cheap, hurried and that many corners were cut…in the art, writing and production department. This should be a cheap DLC pack not a $70 AAA title. I do not recommend this game, even at bargain bin prices. This once great franchise has been run into the ground at the expense of all of us who just want a great COD game. They need to reboot this with fresh eyes and start from scratch or it just won’t survive. I hate to say I would ever abandon the franchise but this may be the nail in the coffin for me. MS are your hearing us?",

Same old DMZ which I thought was frustrating and boring. Might be fun if you have a group to play with.\n\nI don’t play Warzone, so I don’t know how good that is. But that game is free to play, so I definitely wouldn’t buy this game if that is all you are going to play.\n\nThis game was a cash grab, and I’m so disappointed in this game series. I plan on never buying another COD title again.",

For the first time in 10 years I'm very disappointed with my purchase of this game.\nAs far as pre-ordering this game from Amazon was also a bad experience as they shipped my game via US Postal Service. My US postal service is terrible! This time they delivered my game to my neighbors house, they brought it to my house after they got home around 8pm. I have Amazon Prime, if I would've known I would've just gone to Walmart or Game Stop to buy it as soon as they opened their doors in the morning. I will NEVER pre-order another game through Amazon."

The only worry I have about that is just in case my boys decide to yeet the thing that I can’t replace any broken controller parts.\n\nOtherwise it works incredibly well, it will need extra memory if you have more than one game you want to download to it, so be prepared to purchase an microSD CARD as well as the gaming system.\n\nPros: solid build, easy to use, great compact device for travel and at home.\n\nCons: all in one system so if something breaks, it’s tougher to replace.

I've always enjoyed handheld game consuls over ones that connect to the computer or the computer cause I always feel tied down. Whereas playing a handheld gives me the freedom to play where I want when I want. Also I love it cause it gives me the joy of the PSP and the 3Ds as it has all of those fun Nintendo features but also a large single screen. I don't play that many RPGs and mostly play visual novels but for me its preformed great. The graphics show up clear and it feels nice. I can't really say about it's durability cause I bought a case, and carrying bag for it at the same time and even though I dropped several times by mistake that was probably due to the case protecting it. However I know Nintendo products are made verily well. And it feels WAY more sturdy then the PSP was and since its just one solid mass it appears it will last longer then a 3Ds [which I've scene the top screen break off after a long period of time and several drops later] The only thing I would really say is it doesn't seem like it is comfortable to carry around if you don't have carrying bag. I don't really know how you would do it. But a simple carrying bag and the thing is light and easy to carry. Extremely fun. And great if you want a Switch without buying the 300 dollar one. As it gives you the same experience without connecting to the TV which for me isn't any bother anyway since I rather play on the go.",

                "9": "The switch lite has been on the market since the summer of 2019 and priced ~$199.99 which is an extremely good value. My tendency is to compare it to the original game boy which was gifted to me as a young child back in the early 90’s which was priced at $89.99 so when accounting for inflation, the switch lite is an even better value by a few dollars. Of course graphically it’s a bit lacking by the standards of today but just like the original game boy, it’s all about the games and this is where the nintendo switch shines. For games like botw & totk it might be better to dish out an extra $100-150 to be able to play those gems on a big screen tv but for me, my 1st game purchase was ultra street fighter which was purchased nearly a year before even owning the system. A game like sf or TETRA’s Escape is perfect for quick gaming on the go.\nThe biggest negative imo is that battery life is a bit disappointing considering the original game boy which used 4x double-a batteries easily provided at least 12hrs of continuous gaming if my memory is correct and that was released 30 years before the switch lite. The D-pad is great vs the regular switch… recently been reading lots of speculation about the “switch 2”… quite interesting/funny imo as knowing nintendo, there’s no guarantee that their next console will be anything like the current switch because the big n is so innovative that their next console could be somewhat different but obviously we’ll see.",
                "10": "Update (Feb. 12, 2020):\n\nI originally gave this product 5 stars because the excitement of a brand-new handheld Nintendo console had not yet worn off. Now that I've been using it for a few months, there are a few things I take issue with.\n\nThe first issue I've noticed is that the eShop is PAINFULLY slow compared to other devices. I understand that the Switch is behind other consoles in general, but I think there's an issue when it can run Minecraft (a CPU-intensive game) better than it can run the eShop. I know that in my original review I said that the eShop lag wasn't too bad, but it can be at times. I really don't see the reason for this. I mean, it's not a smooth experience at all. The icons take a while to load sometimes and if I scroll too fast I have to wait for it to catch up. It's the same thing when I switch between the menus, too. And no, it's not my WiFi.\n\nNow, the other issue I have is the home screen. On the 3DS, you could customize the icons however you wanted, you could put things in folders, and you could even have really cool themes! With the Switch, you don't get any of this. You get a dark mode and a light mode. That's it.\n\nNow, if you don't care about these features that's fine, but I personally like having the option to personalize my devices. Also, it's painful having to scroll through the games you have installed on your switch because the icons are so large and you can't make them stay where you want them. It's just really clunky and annoying.\n\nAnother thing is if you're looking to you're looking to use your Switch for anything other than playing games, you're out of luck. There is no internet browser and no streaming apps. There is a YouTube app, but it's kind of bare-bones and you can't look at comments on videos.\n\nSo, for these reasons I had to knock off a star from my review. The only reason I didn't remove more stars is because I still believe the Switch is a great system with a lot of potential. I still believe that Nintendo should continue with this idea and I hope that they take people's criticism into consideration.\n\nOh, and this isn't really the SL's fault, but the screen is pretty small so certain games can be hard to play on it because it can be hard to see certain parts of the UI. Just something to look out for.\n\nAlso, I know some people have already been experiencing JoyCon drift with this console, but I personally haven't had a problem with it yet.\n\nOriginal Review (Oct. 2019)\nI really, REALLY love this system.\n\nI don't own the original Nintendo Switch, and I got the Lite because of the lower price point and the lovely colors. I also wanted to play a lot of the games that are on the Switch, but not the 3DS. I was going to wait for the Zacian and Zamazenta edition to come out, but I decided I liked the turquoise edition better and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.\n\nNow that I have it, I must say that I am very pleased with its performance. It runs faster than I expected from a system that is so small. I haven't noticed any severe lag (although it does lag a little bit if I go through the eShop categories too fast).\n\nSpeaking of size, the Switch Lite is perfect. It's just big enough that I can see the screen just fine, but not too big that it's uncomfortable to hold. Keep in mind that I am someone with fairly small hands, so a person with larger hands may find the buttons and joysticks to be too close/cramped for their liking.\n\nThe screen resolution is one of the highlights of this system. Compared to my 3DS XL, the screen is fantastic. Seriously, I didn't realize how bad the 3DS screen is until I compared it with this system. All the games look amazing, especially Super Mario Bros. U. Mario Kart 8 also looks great.\n\nAnother thing I like a lot is the form factor. I like that everything I need to see is just on one screen and that the buttons right there beside it. It's not that I don't like the clam-shell design of the DS line, it's just that this form factor feels more comfortable to me. Of course, the form factor does come with its downsides. For example, it's going to be a lot easier to scratch the screen and the buttons. But that can be remedied if you just get a screen protector and a case to put it in.\n\nAnother thing I like is that it comes with a charger. It seems like a no-brainer to put something to charge the device in with the packaging of the device itself, but guess what? When I got my 3DS, I had to buy the charger separately. Just another way for Nintendo to get money out of me, I guess. Luckily they did not make the same mistake with the Switch Lite. I also like that the cable on the charger is so long. It makes it easier for me to charge it and play it at the same time because I can get comfortable without worrying about holding my Switch in an awkward position.\n\nAlthough there are a ton of positives about the Switch Lite, I do have one complaint. My screen came with a stuck pixel. That really annoys me, but because it's kind of a light green/white I can't really see it when I'm playing games unless I'm specifically looking for it on the screen. I can only really see it when I'm in the eShop. It does suck though that an otherwise perfect system would have a flaw that can really be annoying at times. And anyway, Nintendo has said that it's a common issue with the screens so I don't expect that they would do much about it anyway.\n\nI was pretty disappointed when I figured out that the DS line of systems is pretty much dead now, but after buying the Switch Lite I'm kind of excited for the future of Nintendo handheld systems. I hope that they come out with more colors for the Lite and I also hope they expand upon this system like they did with the DS line.\n\nOverall, I think this system is a drastic improvement upon the DS line, but beware of stuck pixels and the fact that Nintendo does not seem to care about them."

                "1": "This thing is awesome. Changed racing games for me forever. So much more fun than the Playstation 4 controller, driving is much more precise and natural of course. I play Gran Turismo, Assetto Corsa (can't get clutch to work), Dirt Rally, Dirt 5.0 and F1 2016. It does not work with Burnout Paradise (darn it) or Trackmania Turbo (man, that sucks!!!). These are the only games I have tested so far.\n\nI have logged about 30 hours on it in the last 2 weeks, the joys of staycations. Had no problems so far, just loads of fun.\n\nPros... excellent build quality, real leather steering wheel cover, force feedback, easy to set up, nice cable management on the bottom of the unit, works well with a lot of games, connected right up to a wheel stand I purchased, the excellent GT Omega Apex (5 star), see my review on Amazon. It does not look to crazy or over the top sitting in my living room on a stand.\n\nCons... main gripe is the Playstation button and the options button are right together so when I reach for pause I usually hit the PS button also, just annoying when you were just shoved into the wall and spun out by computer AI for the hundredth time and are frustrated trying to restart, I would think good player testing would space those button out a bit. Steering wheel just seems a little small sometimes, especially on hard turns/hairpin turns or dirt rally out-of-control spinouts, I wish the paddle shifters were stationary and not connected to the wheel but it isn't the end of the world\n\nSummary... incredibly fun and worth every penny. I can already see that I will get my money out of this. Adds a lot of immersive fun to the driving/racing games and sims. May not be as fancy as a $1500 Fanatec rig but its a lot of fun anyway. The gear shifter is insanely fun since I drive stick everyday in my car and for some games you can set up a realistic clutch pedal. Once again, very immersive. I want the VR goggles next to really get in there.\n\nNote... I did notice complaints in other reviews about notchyness in the way the feedback happens, it's true, its there but I never notice it anymore, just at first because I had read about it, does not affect my driving, that's all my mistakes, nothing to do with the wheel notches ;). Also, it does not self center like others have said but it does not bother me either I am usually trying to square it back up naturally anyway. For the price you pay these things are not a concern to me. This is THE LOW COST ALTERNATIVE. I have not tried any others to compare to so for the moment, until I go pro, this will do.\n\nI would recommended for beginners, kids, racing game sim enthusiasts and fun seekers, pros will probably not want this. No one would buy this after using a high end rig I am sure. If this becomes addiction, I will probably upgrade to a better wheel in a few years when I upgrade my gaming system.",
                "2": "I recently purchased the Logitech G Dual-Motor Feedback Driving Force G29 Gaming Racing Wheel for use with my racing simulation games, and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with its performance.\n\nThe wheel is well-designed and feels comfortable to grip, with a realistic steering wheel feel that adds to the immersion of the game. The dual-motor feedback is incredibly responsive and allows for precise control over my car, providing a realistic sense of the road and car movement.\n\nOne of the features I appreciate about the G29 is the adjustable pedal set. The pedals are made of high-quality materials and offer a great amount of resistance, providing a realistic feel to the acceleration and braking of the car. The pedals can be adjusted for height and spacing, making them customizable to each user's individual needs and preferences.\n\nAnother great feature of the G29 is its compatibility with a variety of gaming systems, including PlayStation and PC. The wheel is easy to set up and connect, and the software is user-friendly and allows for customization of the controls and feedback.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Logitech G Dual-Motor Feedback Driving Force G29 Gaming Racing Wheel for anyone looking to enhance their racing simulation experience. It's a high-quality, reliable product that provides an immersive and realistic gaming experience.",
                "3": "you're probably deciding between this and the t300. you have two concerns.. the pedals and the force feedback.\n\nboth are good. the pedals aren't bad at all. heavier and more resistance than i thought they would have. solid build. they're slightly small. i'm size 12 and the only thing i can't do is trail break with both feet comfortably , so i heel toe. but single foot driving is no problem.\n\nthe feedback has more resistance than i expected. you feel losing traction, catching a skid, the wheel will tear away from your grip if you set it high enough. it centers itself no problem, so letting go of the wheel to get straight works just like it does in real life.\n\nyou know the t300 does feedback better. i'm just letting you know that the g29 didn't give me buyers remorse. $200 on black friday, i'm happy.",
                "4": "Taken this through several laps around famous tracks in asseto corsa and on several laps through different rally games. Pedals are strong and responsive and the steering wheel perfectly simulates real track driving. I myself am a semi professional auto cross driver and the steering wheel gives you a almost true to realistic experience.",
                "5": "I used this in my racing arcade cabinet. You can use the software to limit the travel to whatever angle you want. So if you have steering that is too sensitive, you can increase the turning radius. If you have steering that is not sensitive enough, you can decrease the turning radius. The sensitivity of the pedals and steering is adjustable.\nThe pedals mounted to a plastic base but the pedal pads, arms and bases are all metal and very sturdy.\nYou can remove the base and screw the pedals directly to your sim or arcade cabinet.\nThe gas pedal spring is linear and has minor resistance. The clutch pedal has a progressive spring that is slightly stiffer than the gas pedal. The brake pedal is also a progressive spring and gets pretty stiff as you push it harder. Dont listen to the people talking bad about the brake pedal, they obviously had never driven a real car. The pedals feel nearly identical to a real car.\nThe steering is extremely accurate and will detect even 1 degree of movement on highest settings.\nThe strength of the force feedback is adjustable and on max settings will easily rip the steering wheel out of your hands. The force feedback on max settings capable of far more force than any real car or even race car.\nThe steering wheel is also metal framed and wrapped in real leather so it is very sturdy with no flex.\n\nThe only reason I give it 4 stars is due to the fact that you cannot swap steering wheels or remove the buttons.\nThe steering wheel is also a bit small for my liking.\nThe force feedback motor is also pretty noisy. It makes enough noise for my wife to ask what's wrong with it. It constantly makes grinding type noises.\n\nOverall. It's fantastic quality and capability the price. Most people wouldn't mind the smaller wheel and noisy motor.",
                "6": "First a frame of reference. I use this for Gran Turismo Sport on the PS4. I previously had a Driving Force Pro from Logitec as well. I’ve played each iteration of Gran Turismo since the original Gran Turismo (it was not called GT1) and have used a wheel on that game starting w/ Gran Turismo 3 (a-spec) and have logged . . . about a billion miles.\n\nI love this wheel dearly. I’ll talk about the pedals separately.\n\nThe operation is very smooth and it’s much quieter than my old DFP. Metal paddle shifters are wonderful; I’ll add a shifter once it’s supported in a GT game. There is a blue metal band on the top of the wheel making it easy to find center (for those of us who care about that) so it’s not a line of tape that will come loose or fade over time. For me it’s precise as all get out. After using a controller for the first few months I was ecstatic about how I could place my car around the track. But it won’t make anyone a championship driver . . . you’ll just have more precision.\n\nThere is a full complement of buttons on the wheel including (bottom to top) a PS button, Options button and Share button below the center of the wheel. It may take some time to get used to; I’ve hit the share button while trying to pause the game during a practice session. That’s my only quibble. The rotary dial can be used to select the level while the +/- button changes what setting you’re manipulating during a race; you can remap the wheels buttons in the options menu.\n\nGetting my PS4 to recognize my wheel off the bat was easy . . . once I figured out just what to do. I leave my wheel plugged in, turn on the PS4 from the unit itself, then – once the blue screen comes up – press the PS button on the wheel. I mention this because initially I was using my controller to wake up the PS4 and it would take quite some time before the wheel could be used. I hope that helps anyone who’s run into the same issue.\n\nNOW ABOUT THE PEDAL SETUP\n\nI kept this separate because of all the reviews mentioning the pedals. The gas offers very little resistance in comparison to the brakes. The brakes may feel very stiff to others; I myself was somewhat prepared due to the reviews. Compared to my old DFP, the effort required to operate the brake pedal is gargantuan . . . but that’s not a problem. It feels much more like the brakes I’ve used in my (limited) time on the track. The brake has more resistance than the ones in my Buick, but I was able to get used to that. For me it has a much more sporting feel.\n\n**UPDATE 7/29**\nAfter some checking it appears the rubber inside the brake - which causes that resistance - is supposed to simulate a load cell. The brake has a certain amount of travel to a point, then you apply more pressure and modulate how much stopping power you get. It's a bit grabby to work with at first, but I REALLY REALLY love it now. Just took the better part of an afternoon to make it part of my routine. Trail braking is easier too. Back to the original review...\n*******\n\nIn game I’ve noticed something. When using a controller, I have less braking power, but with the pedals – when I really stand on the brakes – the stopping ability is increased. I credit that to the game itself, recognizing what a driver can do with her/his feet vs. the amount of travel available w/ the triggers on the controller. It definitely took some getting used to but the amount of modulation I get from the gas AND the brakes has lowered my lap times tremendously.\n\nLastly, the price of this is awesome in comparison. A $700.00 wheel is not in my budget, and this is the one I’d decided to target. It came up on Prime Day and I snapped it up . . . but I’d planned on buying it eventually at the regular price. It’s smooth and quiet, precise and a great wheel. Worth every penny.\n\nNow I just need a correct wheel stand! The X-Celerator(?) Big Boy stand I have worked for the DFP; the pedals on the G29 are way too big.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nGreat wheel, Brake pedal takes effort to push but it’s worth it, HIGHLY recommended for price.\n\nHope this helps.",
                "7": "My 15yo son has received the unit and the following is his personal review from here:\n\nI got the Logitech G29 for my birthday. I spent a lot of time researching it, and thought it was the best. I was saving up and going to buy it myself, but I ended up getting it for my birthday as a surprise! I didn’t expect to get it, it was probably the best gift ever. Anyways, let’s get into what I think about it....\n\nFirst thing: It’s actually much better than I expected. I use it on two simulators, Live for Speed(LFS) and Assetto Corsa. Assetto Corsa really shows you how much it’s actually capable of; when the FFB is turned to the max, it’s hard to control. I didn’t think the FFB on it would be as good as it is. The FFB is gear-driven, which is why it’s more economical. This does make it a little noisy, but not enough to bother me, and it’s surprisingly smooth as well.\n\nIt has a sleek look about it, and real leather surrounding the steering wheel. The buttons are nice, and easy to push. They also are in close reach of your fingers, and easy to press while driving. The paddle shifters are good. They’re made of stainless steel, and are easy to shift. I don’t miss-shift when using them, and I don’t really see anything negative about them. The led R.P.M. indicator lights are a nice touch, there’s really not much else I can say about them, except that they sync perfectly with the R.P.M.s of the car that I’m driving.\n\nThe pedals are very nice, and the carpet gripper works surprisingly well. They’re sturdy pedals, and are very smooth. The brake pedal is a bit stiff, but it doesn’t bother me really.\n\nThe desk mount is very good, and sturdy, I’ve never had it come off the desk. It doesn’t fit super thick tables, though, anything above one and 1/4 inches is too thick to get the clamps around well.\n\nThe shifter that goes with the wheel is kind of low grade. It doesn’t have hardly any resistance but read on. I did buy a shifter mount that helps get the shifter in the right position, so it’s not right next to the steering wheel anymore. It greatly improves my shifting. I am planning to get a spring mod that will strengthen the force you need to give the shifter before it moves.\n\nOverall, I’m very happy with the Logitech G29, and I find it even better than expected. I highly recommend this wheel to anyone who is starting to get into sim-racing, and looking for a good first wheel to start their sim-racing hobby!\n\nMods to come.",
                "8": "I'd imagine that like many people I was between the Logitech and the Thrustmaster. I ended up choosing the Logitech, and the first time I felt the force feedback, I was so happy. All I can say is that a wheel with force feedback will bring the games to life, regardless of brand. Three weeks in, I'm still happy with my choice of the Logitech. At the time, the Thrustmaster with the 3 pedal set was approximately a $100 more. Here's a couple reasons why I'm glad I saved that $100:\n1. I needed to buy a stand. I use the wheel in my living room, and given there's no desk in the room, I absolutely require a stand. At first, I used my ironing board which worked ok--it just moved around a bit and looked terrible haha. The pedals actually stick pretty good on carpet with the fold-down carpet spikes. I'd recommend a stand, so if you don't have a desk consider factoring that into the budget as well.\n2. Quality seems to be an issue for both Logitech and Thrustmaster. My unit is plagued with a screeching squeak every time I turn the wheel left--this seems to be a very common problem for the G29. It is horribly annoying, but it seems to be going away finally. If I had bought in store, I'd probably try to swap, but its not so loud that I'd take the time to make a warranty claim. Outside of this issue, the unit seems very well built. I can bear the minor screech, and I'm confident in the reliability of the unit.\n3. The pedals are great. I've tried the pedals very cheap and hilariously bad Thrustmaster T-80. While I'm not sure how the better pedals compare, these Logitechs are leaps and bounds better. It seems more experienced users complain about the built-in rubber cone mod. At first, I could see why, but after it breaks in after a couple hours, I came to like it. The gas pedal is a bit light, but not bad. The clutch feels pretty decent.\n\nNow for the not so great:\n-The wheel is smaller than an actual wheel which is disappointing given the good quality of the materials.\n-The aforementioned screech.\n-The gears clunk occasionally. It's not as loud as other people make it out to sound; I wouldn't say it's loud at all. The clunk usually happens during situations like heavy countersteer (fighting against the force feedback).\n\nOverall, the Logitech is a brilliant unit for $200. Though sometimes noisy, it breathes life into driving games with smile-inducing force feedback for a competitive price.",

                "10": "I was contemplating buying a wheel to play GT7 on that instead of a controller. Being a beginner I definitely wasn't going to spend a lot to find out I didn't like it. Man what a good time this wheel is!! Only played 5 races or so and I don't have my setup yet so I had it on my lap, which is a pain in the ass, but still it's so much fun lol. I like the feedback in the wheel, you can tell when the car is getting loose or pushing and chattering tires. I'm sure it's no where near high end wheels, but for casual racing alone or with friends, it was worth it for me."

                "1": "UPDATE: These wireless headphones are working much better now with a more recent update. I was experiencing frequent but very brief audio dropouts before the update, but it seems like the latest update has addressed this issue. If you are experiencing any audio issues, try updating the headset using the Xbox accessories app on your console.\n\nThe headset has experienced little to no issues since the update, and I'm very pleased with how they function, how they sound, and how they feel to wear.\n\nOriginal review follows:\nI bought these because I got tired of using my CloudX Flight headset dongle. I liked that these connect directly to the console like a controller. Comparing these to the CloudX, the sound is so much better. There's serious bass to this thing, unlike the CloudX which sounds weak and flabby in the low end. It also feels sturdier. I love the convenience of connecting it without a dongle. As for fit, I liked the CloudX much more. This one is very tight on my head, but fortunately the ear cups are soft. It doesn't shift around on my head like the CloudX does, so I guess that's the trade-off. But there is one serious flaw that I can't seem to get around. The audio drops out intermittently. After around 15-20 minutes of use, the audio will start to drop out for a very brief moment, around a fraction of a second. This occurs about once a minute, and it grows to be very, very annoying and tiresome quickly. I use these for online gaming, and having my friend's voices or game audio drop out this frequently is driving me nuts. I'm sitting about 7 feet from the console with direct line of sight, nothing blocking the signal from my console to my headphones. The router isn't nearby, either, so I don't know what could be causing it. Turning it off and back on doesn't help either. The only solution is to turn the headset and console off and back on, which fixes the problem for about 15 minutes, then it's back to the frequent audio drops.\n\nI love everything else about this headset, but the annoying audio drops are really ruining an otherwise great product. If I find a solution, I will update this review.",
                "2": "So, I've been using the Xbox Wireless Headset, and I've got some thoughts to share.\n\nFirst off, the sound quality is quite impressive. The audio is clear and really adds depth to my gaming experience. The spatial audio feature is a neat touch, helping me better locate in-game sounds and giving me an edge in competitive play.\n\nComfort is a big deal for me during long gaming sessions, and this headset delivers. The ear cups are well-padded, and I can wear it for hours without discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a snug fit.\n\nWireless connectivity is seamless, and the battery life is reliable, meaning it doesn't conk out in the middle of an epic gaming session.\n\nThe microphone quality is good too, offering clear communication with my gaming buddies.\n\nAll in all, the Xbox Wireless Headset is a solid addition to my gaming setup. It combines excellent sound quality, comfort, and reliable wireless performance. I'd definitely recommend it to fellow gamers.",
                "3": "These are about as good as it gets for a sub $100 headset.\n\nSolid build, comfortable, good enough audio, and all kinds of slick features like adjusting volume with the outer earcups.\n\nOne of the cool features that some may not known about, is that you can have these connected to your Xbox and another Bluetooth device at the same time. So you can still get in-game audio while being able to listen to podcasts from your phone. This was honestly huge for me. On PC I love to listen to podcasts or random YouTube channels while I play. So at first I was kind of bummed that I wasn't really able to do that on Xbox. But these make it possible.",
                "4": "PROS:\n\n* Bass-heavy out of the box, but after a few equalizer tweaks sound is loud and clear\n* Easily syncs with your Xbox, Windows, PC, and even your phone!\n* Can power your Xbox on and off from the headset\n* Volume, chat, and game audio are easily controlled by turning the left and right ear pieces, making them really easy and fast tk adjust during gameplay\n* Comfortable and fits snugly\n* GAME CHANGER: allows simultaneous syncing with your phone and Xbox! Can automatically reduce game and chat audio for an incoming call\n* USB-C charging\n*\n\nCONS:\n* Sound is garbage out of the box. Too bass heavy, almost unusable\n* Indicator light is on the mouthpiece, which cannot be seen while wearing, difficult to tell headphone status based on a light that cannot be seen unless you take off the headset\n* Ear foams can get uncomfortably warm from body heat after extended gameplay\n* Charging port is a little difficult to find, should be in a more convenient location\n\nFirst headset I purchased that I’ve been completely satisfied with. Sound and features far better than Turtle Beach products in the same price range. Really hope they last…",
                "5": "Admittedly, I went with another brand first due to its price point and review ratings. That other brand connected just fine with my Xbox One X but no audio came out of the headset. I tried changing settings on the TV and console, did research online, but still unsuccessful. So, I returned it. I bought the actual Xbox brand headset at just around $10 more. I charged it overnight and then connected it the next day. It too a little longer than expected for the headset to pair with the console but it eventually did. As soon as it was connected, I could hear the headset produce audio as it is intended to do. I've been using it for several days now and have been extremely happy with its fit an function. If you are an audiophile that holds electronics at a high standard, this may not meet your expectations. However for me and most other gamers, the sound quality is very good and the bass is more than sufficient. I like that you can control the volume by turning the side of the headset. You can also control the chat/game fader the same way. Why is this a big deal? Because you don't have to fumble with trying to locate the volume buttons due to the dials being the entire side of the headset. It's hard to mess up.\n\nI hope this review helps other gamers out there looking for an affordable and more than adequate headset that can be connected to not only your Xbox, but your phone and other devices.",
                "6": "I own Razer..B&O(highly Recommend if you got the money). Granted I'm new to the Gaming headphones but I'm a master headphone guy..I have Sennheiser...Sony MDR(the best)..

                "7": "Love this headset. My previous headset was a HyperX Cloud II, which I bought because it was so highly reviewed. It had many issues, so I spent a ton of time researching before buying this one.\n\nPros:\n-Wireless with no noticeable lag. Could not believe there wasn’t some type of noticeable latency\n-Comfort. I’ve not once thought to myself “man, these are uncomfortable, my head hurts, my ears are worn out” etc\n-Audio quality. The sound on these is great for the price point. No complaints here.\n-Mic quality. My friends are SUPER picky about mics. Whether it’s echos, ambient noise, feedback, whatever, they lose their minds. They haven’t complained once while playing, and they have said it sounds good.\n-Battery life. No complaints. Haven’t had them die yet.\n\nCons:\nNone that I can find\n\nGenuinely impressed with this. We’ll see how long it holds up. I’m a buy once cry once guy when it comes to gaming, so I hope these hold up for years to come.\n\nI appreciate that they work similarly to a controller, meaning turning the headset on will turn on the xbox (and TV if you have your CEC set up to allow the xbox to control the TV).\n\nIt’s a 10/10 from me. Miles above the HyperX headset I had before this.",
                "8": "I have been using this headset for the last couple of months, everything came fine when I bought it, and so far I really like the experience with it, the battery holds up some hours, nothing mind-blowing but it's also really easy to charge with the front USB port of the Xbox (you can change this with the Xbox turn off)\n\nThe sound is great, it has a heavy base and you can configure everything as you would like on the headset configuration page on your Xbox (These settings are stored in the headset itself, so using it on a PC or Phone will have the changes)\n\nI mostly use this for when I'm going to play with friends, the mic sounds perfect and you don't need to move the thing to be able to catch your voice, I also noticed it's very directional, so if I'm seen a video on my phone, with a reasonable distance from the mic it doesn't catch any sound away from my voice, which is really cool.\n\nThe only issue I have with this headset is that it's kind of uncomfortable with prolonged gaming sessions if you use glasses, I think that it's more like an issue with my glasses than the proper headset, my glasses have like a curve, they are not 100% straight with the sides of my head and I think that adds pressure, so yeah, after using this for a while I start to feel some discomfort/pain on the sides of the head. I will say it happens after 2-3 hours so nothing that bad, but it happens.\n\nI'm still happy with the product, I easily recommend this as a good companion for your Xbox.",
                "9": "So, I'm not an avid gamer by any means. I recently got an Xbox Series S and it came with the wired headset, but I kept getting the wire all wrapped around my hand or I would pull it out while trying to put my controller down and go into the other room. It got very annoying very fast. I did research on headsets for a couple weeks. I didn't want to spend unnecessary money on an expensive pair that I wasn't actually happy with or had features I really didn't need.\n\nThe main features I was looking for in a headset were: wireless, simultaneous Bluetooth and mic monitoring. Nothing fancy at all. I have to say it was incredibly hard to find more than a few headsets that had simultaneous Bluetooth connection so that I could listen to music or take phone calls while I was also gaming and hearing the audio from that. When I saw these did it, I was really excited and thought it was a better option than shelling out more money for some higher tier headsets like the SS Arctis 9X or TBs. I read too many mixed reviews about those, where the negatives were just too worrisome for me to really consider getting them. I did see mixed reviews for these, but I took the risk since they are not as expensive and I figured I'll just try to be extra gentle when handling them.\n\nSo far, these are definitely what I needed and wanted! The simultaneous Bluetooth is a huge win for me. A friend of mine doesn't have a headset, so we just talk on a phone call while we game, but I'm absolutely still able to hear the audio from whatever game I'm playing. There's also an in-game chat mixer built in, just rotate the outer part of the left ear cup to adjust as needed. Volume adjusting is the right side ear cup.\n\nThe ear cups feel very comfortable. It's some type of memory foam. I haven't noticed any sort of discomfort unless I play for 6+ hours straight and that happens rarely and I really only think that's due to the fact that I wear glasses. The head band also is comfortable for the most part. I would say that I do start to notice a bit of discomfort after a few hours. I don't really mind this, as I usually just slightly adjust it forward or back or my head once in a while. Not a big deal for me, though.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like is the placement of the microphone mute button... all the way on the back of left ear cup on the mic piece. It's not on the mic itself, but the arm of it, which also could be a bit longer in my opinion. Sometimes I worry I'm not close enough to it for it to clearly pick up my voice, but luckily the mic monitoring does help me to know how loud or quiet I am and if the other people can hear me.\n\nAltogether I'm very happy with these and I'll try to give an update to my review after 6+ months of use.",
                "10": "Easy to pair but wish the instructions it comes with had at least a sentence in each one than just pictures because would love to know how long the battery lasts bur i will keep it updated and see how long it actually lasts me fully charged( took me about 14 hrs till it died and i had to charge it again) and how long it takes to charge the headset( took about 1hr and a half or so) but other than that it's easy to pair this headset because it pairs exactly like controller and after it pairs then you can use it, to turn it off and on all you have to do is press the button once to turn off and hold the button for a couple of seconds to turn it on and Xbox sends a notification when you turn it on.. also when pressing the mute button the light on the mic turns off and when mute is off the light turns on but you can also get use to the mute noise when on or off and everything is all good so far but will keep this updated within the next few months and my finally thoughts on this headset."

                "1": "Alright, I'll preface this by saying I'm not a racing sim person. Never have been. I'd gotten an earlier version of Forza for the Xbox 360 out of curiosity, and my son enjoyed it a bit, but neither of us really got into it, being into first person shooters instead on the consoles...\n\nBut in April I grabbed an Oculus Rift, and of course one of the things I ultimately had to try was a racing game, and it really turned it into a different experience. Enough that I decided I needed to try a wheel and pedals to control it, not just the Xbox controller. So I did some digging, and this was the one that seemed to hit the right price point and was supported in the Project Cars game I have on the Oculus system.\n\nSetting up couldn't be much easier - I was clamping it to my PC stand (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BBKNI6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and that actually worked quite well, but I did end up just ordering an actual racing wheel stand this evening to improve the experience. The only thing I would've wanted them to change is to have some kind of plate or bar on the bottom to help hold all the cables in place as you're getting things set up. There are small channels underneath this, where they run, so they're recessed and this sits flat on the surface you're clamping it to. But I had issues with a short cable getting pulled out the first time I was setting things up. Having something that slid over that to help keep them in place would've been nice. But it's a minor annoyance, wasn't even worth dropping a star.\n\nSo once you get things plugged into this, you can connect it to power, but don't plug into the PC until you've installed the software, which will then prompt you to connect the USB cable. I did this on Windows 10, and had no issues.\n\nThere was a firmware update right away, so I ran that as well. Then it was time to play.\n\nProject Cars in the Oculus had support for this, so that's what I tried first, and then realized that this is apparently a game that reverses the pedals by default, so I had to go into the options and remap all three pedals to get it to work. But once I did that, I was quite blown away by the experience.\n\nHaving never used a racing wheel before, I didn't expect the force holding the wheel in place. I expected force feedback as things happened, but I didn't realize how firmly this wheel was going to hold the center position. But it's awesome since it really helps keep you stable.\n\nMost of the video reviews and such talked about how it takes time to convert from a controller to a wheel, and that you can expect to \"relearn\" since it's a whole different experience. I didn't have that issue, since my racing sim gaming was so minimal. I took to it quite quickly, and inside of about three or four races, I had a good feel for it, and my performance soared compared to the hand held controller.\n\nMany people complain about the bright light on the wheel above the Xbox button. For me, not an issue since I have a headset on for the VR system, but I can see how that would be annoying if you're using monitors. Nothing a bit of tape wouldn't solve, but I think the least they could have done is had an option in the software settings to turn the light off altogether.\n\nButton placement is alright, I wish they had been a little closer to the wheel's edges to make it easier to hit, but they're not hard to get at as they are, just not quite as ergonomic as I would've hoped.\n\nUnit is pretty quiet as well.\n\nI see a lot of people complain about the brake pedal being stiff, and it certainly is, compared to the others, but for me it isn't an issue. I may not know enough about these though to have the \"right feel\" for how it SHOULD be, and that may be why it doesn't bother me. But as a total racing sim tyro, it's not causing me any issues at all.\n\nFor me, this really became a \"Wow, I'm sure glad I got this!\" kind of an item the first day I had it. With the VR headset, this really completes the immersion. And when it's on this desk I'm using right now, and I\"m on the bench in front of the setup, my hands are EXACTLY where they show up in the Oculus, so the illusion is complete for me.\n\nFeels great, love the resistance in turns since that really helps me keep on track and not spin out as much, and while the price seems steep to me, I didn't have many options considering I'm on a Windows 10 PC and may use it on the Xbox One as well at some point. But while the price was steep, I'm looking at it as one of those, \"You get what you pay for\" things. It completes the illusion of actually racing, and that made the price point less of an issue for me.",
                "2": "Not even pressing on the pedals and it shows full input on all 3 pedals. Doesn't change if I use them.\n\nPlaying any racing game the accelerator and clutch pedal are combined. Sometimes the accelerator will go up to 30-50% and I have to press the clutch to reach 100% as if they were combined eventho that box remains unchecked. I let it go a few months hoping it was driver related, constantly Uninstalling and reinstalling different drivers but nothing has changes.\n\nWorse experience I've had in a LONG time. Waste of money. I hope I can get warranties or my money back. So frustrating, so disappointing.\n\n***Update***\nAfter some rough customer service via web chat and trying to warranty the product and waited for the warranty email I had never received, I was sure it was a hardware defect and not a software defect.\n\nI found a pinch in the main wire whip right by the pedal assembly. After rewiring the 5 wires with solder+water proof heatshrink, the pedals worked phenomenally!!!\n\nI do like logitec but it seems like their QC has gone south quite a bit. I had a $100 keyboard that lasted just passed the warranty as well as a g502 hero Special Edition mouse. I went back to my worn OG-502 and no other mouse compares...\n\nSo about the setup... Finally aving some seat time on the PC with the G920 wheel, pedals, and 6 speed shifter with the addition of a USB handbrake..... the experience is u parallel.. it work from Forza to spin tires, it work with every driving game. If you like racing games or sims and don't want to drop over 1k for an indoor pass time or hobby but get great force feedback and a unique feel to every pedal. Then definitely gamble and get one of these logitecs. If you have a few extra bills to blow, get something better and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.\n\n***Update, a month or so after this review I found a fault in the wiring, I cut out the bad section and spliced the wires back together, works great, great product. I bought my friend one as a gift after I fixed my own.***\n\nI would buy again. But I already did :)",
                "3": "Seems like a great starter wheel. I do feel like there could be something better for securing the wheel to the desk, but with some effort, it's fine. Also, the brake is very hard to apply fully because of stiffness, but not a deal breaker.\n\nThe force feedback is great, and the feel of the wheel is great. I like the leather wrap. Very functional. I've used it often since purchase and it has held up very well.",
                "4": "Wish I had done my research before purchasing. A few weeks after I bought this my brother bought the Thrustmaster TMX PRO which sells for basically the same price as this or less. After using his wheel I would definitely have bought that.\n\nBoth wheels do not come with a shifter and both do have the clutch pedal and conical brake mod for more realistic braking feel. Yet on the TMX PRO the mod is easily installed or removed depending on your preference. On the Logitech it is permanently installed and requires invasive action to remove which also voids the warranty. I like it though, it was a little too stiff at first but after about 30 hours of racing it has broken in and feels great.\n\nBoth wheels offer an optional shifter, and the Logitech one offers 4 things over the Thrustmaster's, push down reverse, alot quieter, very short throw, and a much lower price. The Thrustmaster one is over twice the price, but it feels better, is made mostly of metal and is harder to accidentally put in to the wrong gear. The Thrustmaster also has a separate gate plate that is included with it to make it a sequential shifter. This is excellent for rally driving where the paddle shifters can be difficult to use. It is however very squishy in sequential mode not having that nice positive click that a sequential shifter should have. Because of that I would not purchase it if you're mainly looking for a sequential shifter due to its poor feedback. Their are better dedicated options out there.\n\nThe pedals on the Logitech are 8 bit giving a total of 256 unique positions. This sounds like a lot, but when running F1 cars where braking needs to be incredibly precise the Thrustmaster 12 bit pedals with 4,096 unique positions are noticeably better. The Logitech pedals do grip the carpet better though and look nicer.\n\nThe wheel, the G920 is prettier by far. The all brushed metal construction with leather wrap looks good and feels good in the hand. The Thrustmaster is mostly plastic with some rubber grips at the 10 and 2 'o clock positions. It looks cheap and initially feels cheap too. It is however about a 1/4 inch larger than the Logitech and I like the slight increase in size.\n\nYet this is where the Thrustmaster runs away with the show for me. When actually driving with it the force feedback is noticeably better, its more precise and less notchy. I can't say it is in a whole other league over the Logitech, but it is better. The cheapness of the plastic wheel is all but forgotten from the excellent precision feel you get from the force feedback.\n\nThat being said the Logitech is not without its upsides like better looks and overall build quality. The wheel base does have bolt holes for hard mounting. Which is real nice when using it with a stand. The TMX PRO on the other hand has no mounting holes and its desk clamp sticks down so much it will block your keyboard tray. The Logitech uses dual soft mounts that don't stick down nearly as much allowing access to your keyboard. Both wheel's pedal boxes and optional shifters do have bolt holes for hard mounting.\n\nFrom what I've read around the net, the TMX pro does have a higher failer rate. So if you are looking for something to last a long time the Logitech would most likely be your better bet. Its dual motor gear force feedback system is antiquated and has been around since the G27 wheel which is why it doesn't feel quite as nice as it could. Yet it is a proven system with many G27 wheels still in use today. I'm just speculating, but I think this may be why Logitech has chosen not to update it, just because it has proven to be so reliable.",
                "5": "This works perfectly with Forza on my Xbox. I bought this for a sim racing experience and I’m quite impressed for the price point. I wanted something to practice track driving in the winter and this works well with my setup. A lot of reviews mention the brake being too stiff. I think it feels real if you are used to an actual track car. It does not feel like a mushy video game brake or even a passenger car with power brakes. I have an Ariel Atom it it actually feels quite similar. If you want to brake hard you have to stand on it and that’s how it should be. Highly impressed with the steering wheel and the brake. Accelerator is good. Clutch could use a tiny bit more tension but it’s good enough. Zero complaints. Great product, especially for the money.",
                "6": "Feels great but 3 annoyances... the buttons are far from the wheel and no buttons on the wheel... my ferrari wheel had 4 on the wheel, these you have to partially come off the wheel and hunt for, no good during f1 games but ok for street car games i suppose.\n\nSecond annoyance is that the spacing between the pedals is too narrow, might be ok for kid feet but could do with more spacing for adults, especially when wearing shoes since this is bare metal and no rubber/platic so rather slippery.\n\n3rd annoyance is the turning range, which i guess for some people would be a bonus? but on a computer desk you cant really turn more than 90 degrees left or right of center easily... looks like this designed to be on a specialized open gaming chair rig... again, an annoyance as some games dont allow you to edit the wheel turn distance so youll have to really tinker with sensitivity curves to get it useable.\n\nother than that, again, annoyances not major as i still gave it 5 stars, its a great wheel and pedal set, far better than my older ferrari 3 in 1 setup!",
                "7": "This wheel is great! Its super easy to set up and clamps right to your desk. Its force feedback is customizable with the installation of Logitech G Hub. You can customize it per game or just an overall tweak. Makes driving games super fun.",
                "8": "I never liked trying to play a racing game with the standard Xbox controller, but I put up with it for years, not wanting to spend the money on a wheel. Well, I finally took the plunge and after first buying the wrong one (the PS version) I got this one when it was on sale around Christmas.\n\nAt first, I made a crude stand for it using two plastic sawhorses and 3/4\" plywood. It worked ok, but wasn't ideal. Plus, we were finishing the room it was in and that setup wasn't going to fly. So, I bought an adjustable wheel stand. The G920 mounted to it pretty easily and it's stable enough to handle the most aggressive driving.\n\nAs for the G920 itself, it's been great. I did learn quickly that you have to adjust it within the games or it can be more difficult to handle than the controller. I had constant oversteer in corners of Forza Horizon games until I looked up some tips on what input variables to adjust. Now, it works great. I've ordered the shifter. I know that manual shifting is dying out in real vehicles, but I still enjoy it and look forward to that addition in the near future. My only complaint is that the USB cable isn't long enough. In my setup, it's hanging in the air when the wheel stand is in its position and its plugged into the Xbox. I guess I can get an extender, but haven't done so yet.\n\nThe wheel and pedals are pretty well made and feel fairly solid. The paddle shifters work well and the force feedback is pretty strong. It has taken some adjustment on my part as when I used the standard controller, I accepted that it was a video game and wouldn't feel like driving a real car or truck. With the wheel, I kind of expected it to feel EXACTLY like a real car, but there is a bit of numbness--even though the wheel tries to transmit some road feel.\n\nAs this is the only wheel/pedal setup I've ever used, I can't compare it to others, but I've been extremely happy with it so far and the addition of the shifter is sure to make it even more enjoyable.",
                "9": "This is Logitechs G29 (PS) for Xbox. The force feedback is nice, and the wheel itself has a fairly sturdy feel. I haven't owned a wheel since the one that came out with a Forza game back on Xbox 360.\n\nBut I can't NOT be irritated by the fact that the wheel has two buttons that DO NOT FUNCTION.\n\nYou'll see, in the images, LSB and RSB buttons. In a lot of driving games this is extremely important. I primarily play Snow Runner, so swapping between cameras is mandatory in certain situations - Plan on having to use your controller.\n\nThere is NO support for these buttons and as far as I know, no reason to fix it. At the time I purchased the G920, it likely WAS the best deal on the market in this price range. However, since its release, several other manufacturers have joined the space with options in the same price range.\n\nFunctionally, it's still a good starter wheel and I've enjoyed it, but it REALLY irritates me that I have to use my controller to use my wheel. If you send ANY input through the controller it immediately stops listening to your wheel. Want to adjust yoru camera so you can fit around that corner? Better come to a complete stop first or your last throttle input may just continue rolling forward, while your wheel does nothing because you're in the middle of adjusting your camera to see around the bend.\n\nI don't write a lot of reviews, and this may seem silly, but it isn't to me.\n\nGood entry wheel, unless you're a usability nerd like me and get angry about dumb stuff like having NON FUNCTIONAL buttons on the wheel. It kind of digs at me just thinking about it. Why not just remove the buttons?\n\nI don't know if they work on the PS G29 or not. Nor do I care at this point - I've simply resigned to the fact that this will always irritate me so it's best to return it and pick something that doesn't have non-functional 'features'.",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.\n\nNOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for \"ALWAYS ON\" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to \"ALWAYS ON\". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)\n\nUnless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.\n\nAll that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it.",
                "2": "After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.\nSoooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!\n\nI never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses.",
                "3": "There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!\n\n1) Daily use\nNot everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:\n- Fits incredibly well around your hand\n- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use\n> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.\n- Great grip\n- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software\n\n2) Gaming\nWhen I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:\n- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!\n- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)\n- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.\n\nOverall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!\n\n*** Update ***\nThe mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself.",
                "4": "The primary purpose of the Logitech G502 HERO is to provide gamers with a high-precision tracking experience. It features Logitech's HERO (High-Efficiency Rated Optical) sensor, which is capable of tracking movement with exceptional accuracy and responsiveness. This sensor offers a wide sensitivity range of up to 16,000 DPI (dots per inch), allowing users to adjust the mouse's sensitivity to their preferences.\n\nI recently purchased the Logitech G502 HERO, and it has completely transformed my gaming experience. This mouse is a true game-changer, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.\n\nFirst and foremost, the tracking precision of the G502 HERO is simply unmatched. The HERO sensor's responsiveness and accuracy are outstanding, providing me with pinpoint control in every game I play. Whether I'm sniping in FPS games or executing precise movements in strategy titles, this mouse never fails to deliver.\n\nThe customizable features of the G502 HERO are another standout aspect. With its 11 programmable buttons, I can assign specific commands or macros to each one, giving me an edge in competitive gameplay. The ability to fine-tune the mouse's sensitivity up to 16,000 DPI ensures that I can adapt it to my personal preferences, making it feel like an extension of my hand.\n\nThe ergonomic design of the G502 HERO is a dream come true for extended gaming sessions. The textured grips provide a comfortable and secure feel, allowing me to maintain precise control without any discomfort. The inclusion of customizable weights is a fantastic touch, as I can adjust the mouse's weight and balance to suit my preferences perfectly.\n\nI must mention the stunning RGB lighting options that the G502 HERO offers. The customizable lighting effects add a touch of personalization and style to my gaming setup. It's a feast for the eyes and creates an immersive atmosphere while gaming.\n\nOne feature I greatly appreciate is the onboard memory. Being able to save my settings directly on the mouse ensures that I can take my preferences with me wherever I go. It's a time-saver and makes switching between different computers hassle-free.",
                "5": "For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.\n\nI have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.\n\nI have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.\n\nIn terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.\n\nRegarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.\n\nSo overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me.",
                "6": "So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.\n\nFirst is the design:\n\nThe design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.\n\nSecond is the software:\n\nThe Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.\n\nThird is the delivery:\n\nIt didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.\n\nIf you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly.",
                "7": "This is a very good mouse, with a lot of customizable buttons. The ergonomics feels good and it's weighty and doesn't feel cheap. I like being able to adjust the weight of it. Someone complained about the scroll wheel being too heavy to click and it hurt, but I don't find this to be an issue. The scroll wheel actually feels very well made and you can set it to click scroll or smooth scroll which is a nice feature. It's a bit pricier than some, but you get what you pay for here.",
                "8": "i tested multiple logitech mice, including mx anywhere 3, m720, mx master 2s, m705, g502 hero, and the m650L, and m510.\n\nin terms of comfort i would rate them (higher is better):\n\nm510: 5\nm650L: 5\ng502 hero: 4.8\nm705: 4.5\nmx master 2s: 4.3\nmx anywhere 3: 3.8\nm720: 1.5\n\n*my hands are glove size, large\n\nin terms of features:\n\nmx master 2s: 5\ng502 hero: 4.6\nmx anywhere 3: 4.5\nm650L: 3.8\nm720: 3.8\nm705: 3.5\nm510: 1.5\n\nclosest to perfect: the g502 and mx master 2s. g502 is more comfortable, has 3x as many programmable buttons, and has semi-quiet clicks, but lacks the magspeed wheel and wireless (and i found the cord not to detract from its usability). the mx master 2s has the most useful features but is a bit less comfortable. The 650L is also great as it has better ergonomics than other Logitech mice, has Bluetooth, has silent clicks, and the semi - free - scrolling wheel is great.\n\nthe m705 is another recommendable choice. It's extremely comfortable and has the free scrolling ability (though without the magspeed). the main drawback with this mouse is that the pads on the bottom are rough compared to other mice so it doesn't glide as smoothly.\n\nthe mx anywhere 3 is an interesting choice as it has the magspeed wheel and while it doesn't provide support for your hand it's not so small as to be painful to use for long periods, but it was the most expensive mouse I tried by a big margin, and the price doesn't seem justified.\n\nI think it's important to point out that the number of features a product offers is not as important as the usefulness of each feature to the individual consumer. E.g. The 650L has fewer features than some of the other models but I would still strongly recommend it for its practical day-to-day usability. features that i cared about in order of their usefulness are as follows (grouped into 3 tiers)\n\nFeatures that mattered most to me:\n\nmagspeed wheel (automatically switches between ratcheted and free scrolling)\nbasic free scrolling wheel\nsemi-free scrolling wheel (m650L)\nSmoothness of gliding\n\nFeatures that I liked but don't use often\n\nbluetooth wireless\nnumber of programmable buttons\nbluetooth connection memory for up to 3 computers.\n\nfeatures i didn't really care about or that made no observable difference:\n\nhigh dpi support\nrechargeability",
                "9": "as you might have guessed it also has a software to control most of what the mouse does, it comes with 11 programmable buttons for all of your productivity needs, controllable rgb lights, and the funniest feature of being able to unlock the mouse wheel and zoom through pages. first the weight, some people just cant find it comfortable at that weight. second the switches of the main buttons, unfortunately they are not great compared to other mouse in the market as they wear down faster that you would think causing it to double click or eventually not work at all\n\nhowever this can be solved by just opening it and cleaning them or straight up replacing the switches with good ones so no problem. And also we dont know when this might happen, hopefully you wont even get to experience that moment.\n\nthird the mouse feet, im referring to the plastic pieces below the mouse that arent part of the mouse itself but rather glued into the mouse.\n\nthey are made of a type of plastic that isnt the one most modern mouse in the market use, thus it isnt as smooth or resistant\n\nWHICH AGAIN, if you start to notice issues you can just replace it with the good material.\n\nDoes this mean you shouldn't buy it? No, for it's price is pretty good, but you should still wait for a good offer to buy this mouse.",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "Great beginners gaming headset, not very loud, wish volume was more adjustable, mic works great, doesn't pick up on too much background noise, noise cancelling for the most part. (can't hear my ex yelling lalala) Have had them a whole year now and still work great, nice long cord with duel plug in.",
                "2": "I got this in a rush when I needed a new headset. In hindsight a bit more research would have had me getting something else. As a precursor to the review I feel that it is worth noting that I am very rough on audio peripherals. I don't know why, but they usually last me about 6 months regardless of the quality and price. This is why I choose to buy at a cheaper price point more frequently rather than high-end less frequently.\n\nPros:\nPrice for the quality is great\nDecent speaker/mic sound\nGood quality cable that is at least 6' long\nSits comfortably on the head\nStereo/mic to separate stereo and mic connector included\nIn-line mic mute switch and audio volume adjustment\n\nCons:\nThe USB is only a power source for the blue lights on the headset (it is a bit misleading in its uses, but if I had researched it a bit more I would have found this out before purchase)\nThe in-line mute and volume knob would be better with a mic gain knob as well\nIt tends to make my head a bit sweaty (I have long hair and live in South Texas, US. So it is hard to find headsets that don't do that, but still something to keep in mind)\nThe headset only goes on one way (The traditional right and left side is enforced by the mic only being usable one way. I know I am in the minority, but I like the mic being on the right side of my head)\n\nSo this is absolutely worth the money, but if you are looking for a high-end headset this is not it. I know my cons were a bit nit picky, and I don't want anyone to think that I regret this purchase. I knew I was getting a quick solution to needing a headset, and I honestly got more than I was looking for. The USB lighting, while completely useless, is a cool addition. The only reason it didn't make it into the pros section is because unless you want to look cool on stream it is wasted resources.\n\nSo, yea. If you want a good quality headset for a good price this is great for you.",
                "3": "I've been using the G9000 headset for a few months now, and it's a solid choice for any gamer and works great for online meetings. First off, the sound quality is on point – I can hear every game detail, which ups my gaming experience. The bass surround is like being in the game! The mic is clear, and my friends hear me without any issues. It's also got this cool LED light that adds some style to my gaming setup. The only small downside is the plastic housing feels a bit cheap, but hey, it's a great deal for the price. In a nutshell, the G9000 is a winner for me.",
                "4": "",
                "5": "",
                "6": " Was a bit skeptical base off the previous reviews but I thought why not give it a shot if it doesn't work out I'll just return it and it doesn't cost that much but it actually turned to be great like I expected. The headphone is really comfortable, the earmuffs fit perfectly around my ears and doesn't hurt when I play for long hours. The mic is great my friends hear me perfectly when I speak and it actually has noise cancellation which I was surprised about. Just put it over your ears and you'll notice the surrounding sounds sound a big more quiet and muffled. Only downside as said in the review is that the USB for the lighting is too short and doesn't not have enough length to have both it and the headphone plugged in at the same time. Still definetkt a great headset for a good price",
                "7": "I have gone through plenty of headsets over the years spending over a hundred dollars or more on headphones., and my no Bulls**t take on the Bengoo G9000 after almost a year of use is that I'll waste no more money on any (off the shelf) budget brands sold at Walmart ever again as the G9000's offer a greater above average price and quality ratio compared to other overpriced budget brands on the market. I'm not going to tell you that the G9000's have amazing sound quality compared to the hyper cloud X' phones I once had, nor is the microphone anything to rave about, but I will say that price and quality offered will bring me back every time before I'll go back into a local Walmart and pay the prices of other budget brands that have often not even lasted beyond the return policy.\n\nThese headphones are above average of my initial expectations in comparison to the junk I've bought in the past. Sturdy design, no static or distortion, the sound is clear, the bass is also clear and decent enough. Noise cancelation is somewhat decent, not the best, but it does cut out background noises enough to keep distractions to a minimum. Comfortable for long play sessions, no ear pain after long usage. Directional noise is clear and identifiable, I can make out shot directions.\n\nIf you can afford something of a higher tier, by all means go for it, but if you were thinking of going into Walmart, or another local store and buying a budget brand within the same price range, don't waste your money on the branding hype, either go big or just buy the G9000's. I've yet to be disappointed after almost a year of use.",
                "8": "The product is really good overall. It's like having a substitute teacher that you can chill with. The cord has its issues of getting in the way or feeling too heavy on one side. The mic works nicely so no itchy or rasp sounds when communicating. I've gotten a better wireless set that competes better than this. Only downside to the wireless is battery life and charging. Otherwise this product is not bad but it could improve especially with the pointless USB connection for the lights.",
                "9": "These are great for the price! I can connect these to my PS5 and my laptop for my WFH meetings. Mic quality is great! Noise canceling seems to work fine because apparently I can’t hear my wife when I’m wearing them. Lol.\nI’m able to mute Microsoft Teams directly from the headset. I have a two year old that has thrown them around and they have yet to break. The length of the cord is not too long and not too short. Definitely worth it!",
                "10": "I've had this for almost a year now. There were some problems with the extension wire when I first got it, so I had to replace that. Besides that, these are really good headphones with good audio quality for it's price. I use them for gaming and music and they're more than sufficient, everything works well.",
                "11": "My son goes through headsets like crazy. Usually they only last like 6 months to a year at best before the connectors start to go out and the headset needs replaced.\n\nNormally I get him the extended warranty on headsets but recently I must not have added it like I thought I did. When it went out I needed to get a new set and it happened to see an ad for this one online. I was skeptical given the low price and no name brand. But I figured it isn’t a huge loss of they were no good.\n\nI picked them up and let him try them. It only been a couple of weeks but he says the sound quality is comparable to other headsets he has had from turtle beach and Astro. He does think they look cooler too.\n\nAll that being said, the real problem with headsets is longevity. I can’t speak to the longevity of these but the sound quality and look of them seems adequate. For now I’ll give 4 stars and can update later if they last longer or shorter time than expected.",
                "12": "Assume it works well. Picture showed both a USB-A input and a 3.5 mm jack input. However USB-A is only for power and won't let computer recognize the headphones or microphone. So not a good choice for newer laptops as they would require two USB ports and an adapter. Seems this is mostly meant for Xbox, Nintendo, and other gaming systems."

                "1": "Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round, for I have encountered a gaming marvel that will flip your world faster than a pancake on a Sunday morning! Enter the realm of Nintendo Switch Sports, where joy meets excitement, and your thumbs embark on Olympic-level training!\n\nRemember the old Wii Sports days? Well, picture that, but with the Nintendo Switch's magical capabilities! It's like Mario and Sonic decided to throw a party, and every iconic Nintendo character RSVP'd for the event.\n\nLet's talk about the games within this gem. From the classic tennis that makes you feel like a Wimbledon pro (minus the sweat stains) to bowling, where even the clumsiest of us can get a strike, each game is a slice of pure joy wrapped in pixelated goodness. It's like having a sports carnival at your fingertips, minus the sweaty athletes!\n\nAnd the controls? Oh, dear friend, they're smoother than butter on a hot biscuit! The Joy-Cons become extensions of your very being as you swing, punch, or shoot your way to victory. It's like the controllers are whispering, \"You got this!\" with every motion.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The multiplayer mode is where the real fun begins. Gather your friends, family, or even your pet goldfish (if they're into gaming) and dive into the competitive world of Switch Sports. It's the kind of chaos that turns family gatherings into legendary tournaments, with laughter echoing through the halls and joyous screams of victory... or defeat.\n\nNintendo didn't just create a game; they crafted an experience. It's like a rollercoaster ride through a pixelated wonderland, where every twist and turn brings a smile to your face.\n\nNow, let's address the graphics. Sure, they might not be hyper-realistic, but who needs photorealism when you have adorable, charming characters dashing across vibrant landscapes? It's like stepping into a living cartoon where the fun never ends!\n\nOh, and the music! It's so catchy, it'll have you humming the tunes even when you're not playing. It's like having a soundtrack that turns every moment into a mini-celebration.\n\nIn conclusion, Nintendo Switch Sports isn't just a game; it's a bundle of joy, a digital carnival that brings people together, and an endless source of entertainment. It's a reminder that gaming isn't just about winning; it's about creating memories, sharing laughter, and having a blast with those you love.\n\nSo, grab your Switch, get ready to break a virtual sweat, and let Nintendo Switch Sports be the MVP in your gaming collection. It's an absolute blast that'll make you want to high-five your screen in sheer excitement!",

There are no bosses or metals to earn in the game.\n\nIf you get a physical copy, it includes the leg strap. It’s the exact same as the one you get from ‘Ring Fit Adventure’. As stated in my review for that one; wished it had double banded vecro instead of one as it can slip down. If you plan to buy digital, you can buy the strap separately for $10 (MSRP). Note that the digital version is $10 cheaper (without leg strap)\n\n7 Sports total. Wii Sports Resort had 13, but also with more modes within individual sports\n\n4 returning sports from Wii Sports/Wii Sports Resort: Tennis, Bowling, and Swordplay (now called chambira), Golf (as part of free update in Fall 2022)\n\n3 new sports: football (soccer), volleyball, and badminton\n\nSeeing that there’s free DlC. It may have live service updates (Like Animal Crossing NH, and Splatoon). No official announcement yet aside from Golf. Hoping for Basketball freethrow, and return of archery in the future at no additional cost if they plan to add more sports\n\nWill give my impressions on each sport at the end (excluding Golf seeing this is a near launch review).\n\nSeeing it’s a near launch review; cannot comment on any gameplay changes, future dlc (more additional sports, or added modes within sports)\n\nPlays like Wii Sports/Wii Sports Resort as you make exaggerated movements or flick of the wrist to have your avatar do moves onscreen. For most games, you don’t really control the positioning of your character. You can do movements around the field with joy stick, but seeing how small the field is, charactgers automatically moves you most of the time. You won’t get a workout unless you play for hours at a time. If you want to sweat, I’d get ‘Ring Fit Adventure’ instead\n\nNo training mode, or practice mini-games like past Wii Sports titles. For some sports you just get a basic tutorial then just play. Doesn’t explain hidden rules and tips well\n\nNo boss battles like past titles either. You do get 3 difficulty modes: Normal, Strong, and Powerhouse. If you play offline there’s no high score tracking or any progression. They are just pick-up games\n\nNow has online. Nintendo Online membership required. Note that you need to play online to get points to spend on cosmetics. If there’s not enough players, there are CPU fill ins. Don’t get why you can’t play with CPU offline and still get points.\n\n-Controls:\n\nUse gyroscope in Joy-cons instead of Gyro + sensor bar in Wii/Wii U games.\n\nSeeing I have adult sized hands; holding the small jon cons doesn’t feel as nice as the Wii Remote. Z button on joy cons are not as ergonomic to press than wii mote (especially when playing bowling).\n\nThere is a left handed mode option\n\nMotion controls only (unlike Ring Fit Adventure which had button only mode). If you own a Switch Lite, must play on table top on small screen, and buy individual joycons. Note: you only can play table top mode (Any version of Switch console) in single player. If you try to play with more than one person, the game won’t let you play. Guess they added this feature to prevent eye squinting and people bumping into each other due to the small screen.\n\n-New Avatars\nMiis make a return (via faces), but you can also use the Sportsmates avatars (anime-esk artstyle) if you want. Now have arms and legs instead of floating arms and feet\n\nWhen you play as Miis, you cannot import mii from other friends’ account, or other accounts that’s not on your Switch system\n\nIn terms of customization: Sportsmates are more focused on individual clothes than faces on Miis.\n\nIf you do plan to play as Miis; only can equip new body clothes. Cannot equip face accessories like hats, masks, beards and glasses\n\nThere are unlockable outfits. Again, tied to online modes. There are default customization options for Sportmates if you don’t have Nintendo Online, but the selection is limited. Cosmetic unlocks change out weekly (cheap mobile game FOMO tactic), so it encourages you to play regularly.\n\nOther unlockable include name tags/titles where you select a two words (an adjective/greeting, and noun) that show above your name in versus screen. Also emotes\n\nEveryone gets different board sets. 24 items total to unlock before they go away. Unlocks are tied to RNG/random on what unlocks first/what order.\n\nOverall, If you own Wii Sports Resort it’s basically the same core experience, but that game had more sports and modes to play around with.\n\nFeels like an unfinished game at launch.\n\nAt launch, aside from the updated HD graphics, and ability to play online; don’t see a reason to pick up this new game unless you don’t have Wii Sports Resort, a Wii or Wii U, or too lazy to take it out of storage.\n\nThis game like Wii Sport, and Wii Sports Resort is very fun with others. Still get that excitement when playing with people locally who you haven’t seen in a while; like playing an ice breaker type board game\n\nNow onto my take on each individual sport.\n\n--List of games (at launch):\n\n1. Tennis\n\nSame as Wii Sports games, but stricter on the on timing.\n\nCharacter position automatically, only need to focus on swings\n\nRotate wrist for top spin or backspin\n\nCan’t play singles tennis. Only doubles. When playing 1v1 you control two people and it feels like a tennis foosball fusion game\n\nAble to set match length/sets. Not sure why there’s no option for it in badminton and volleyball\n\nWished it was more options like Mario Tennis Aces.\n\n2. Bowling\n\nSame bowling in Wii Sports and Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics\n\nControls a bit different. Need to hold the Z button throughout and not let go when you want to release, so it’s one smooth motion. For me doesn’t feel as natural\n\nCan’t swing the ball backwards and scare the spectators anymore. Actually there are no spectators unless you count those standing very far away on the above floors\n\nAble to do 4 player local split screen. No need to take turns. Can play 8 players online (up to 2 people local can joining in)\n\nSpecial lanes return with ramps, obstacles and hill slope lanes. Sort of like Spin Control in Wii Sports Resort\n\nNo (up to) 100 pin challenge or Spare Pickup mode\n\nOnline only mode Survival is a 16 player Bowling Battle Royal. Highest score progress to next stage while others are eliminated. Aside from the high score tennis wall ball mini-game in the credits, this is the best mode in the game at launch in my opinion\n\n3. Chambara\n\nPlays like Sword Play in Wii Sports Resort\n\nCan select type of sword this time: Standard, Charged or Twin Sword\n\nPress ZL to block or guard.\n\nStandard Sword has best base attack.\n\nFor Charge Sword , you build up charge attack meter every time block perfectly (position block perpendicular of opponent’s attack). When meter is full, you can do one strong attack. Note that base attack is weaker than Standard Sword\n\nTwin Sword is basically duel welding. Need two joycons per player obviously. Able to block with one sword and get ready for attack with other. Cannot attack and defend simultaneously. Able to spin attack when sword is charged. Unlock Charge Sword it’s based on how many times swing an attack than block\n\nNo showdown mode like in Wii Sports Resport\n\n4. Soccer:\n\nTwo modes:\n\nTraditional Soccer match with a life size ball: 4v4 or 1v1. Use two joycons per person. One you swing with your arms to kick and shoot. Heard they’re adding in leg strap/kick support in later patch. With other joycon you move/run around joystick. ZL to dash, ZR to pass, B to jump. Swing two hands down for head dive.\n\nThe field is too big in comparison to character’s movement speed in my opinion. Stamina bar doesn’t help. Not as fast as Rocket League, but has better control than Lucio Ball (Overwatch)\n\nSoccer Shootout-Mode. Basically, a penalty shootout. Use leg strap, able to kick with leg this time instead of swinging your arms. Careful not to kick the TV. Ball will be thrown at you and you must kick it at the right time to get a goal\n\n5. Volleyball:\n\nGame positions your avatar for you like in Tennis. Most of the time the game auto positions you, but can make slight move adjustments with joystick when blocking. This mini-game is all about timing and knowing which motion to do at the right time. Game will tell you if you’re doing it too early, or perfectly\n\nMain motions to focus on are Bump, Spike and Block\n\nShake down or swat down movement to spike\n\nTwo hands in the air to set and block\n\nServe by swinging arms up or down\n\nUnderhand lift up to Dig or Bump\n\nGame will give you tips/prompts suggestions on what to do\n\n4 player split screen if you play local co-op. Shows each player on 4 separate screens. Don’t get why they don’t do double split screen for each team\n\n6. Badminton\n\nLike tennis but more involved and faster. Need faster reaction time seeing the smaller field\n\nNeed to press ZL for a drop shot\n\nOnly can play singles. No doubles\n\nThere’s a hidden stamina system. If you swing frantically your character will get tired and accuracy will lower",

                "2": "I love these joy con colors. They work great and look so cute with my switch.",
                "3": "I love these controllers. I already had a set that came with my Nintendo Switch, but I wanted to get more so that more of us could play together. My daughters are always having their cousins and friends over, so it's nice to have more of these controllers. They work so well too. Everyone loves them. It's nice to see them in other colors too. The colors are really nice. I'm sure we'll be getting more. The work great with the switch!",
                "4": "My son needed his replaced after his original ones broke. These worked perfectly as the replacement.\nNo issues since.",
                "5": "TLDR: Fun, and colorful, yet mature, and muted. These are mostly neutral colors that are most reminiscent of the Animal Crossing color palette. As an example, I’m an average guy and I really love these colors, they look even better in person. If you resonate with these colors whatsoever, and you want or need some new Joycons, then I highly recommend the two latest sets of these pastel colored Joycons. Enjoy!\n\nI didn’t need these, but the colors were just too cute for me to pass up. These pastel colors have a similar look and feel to the Animal Crossing matte/pastel green & blue colors. For those who are unfamiliar, those are the colors that are most associated with the limited edition Animal Crossing themed Nintendo Switch (pre OLED model.) If you’re a fan of that color palette, then you’ll definitely love these. To be honest, being a fan of Animal Crossing definitely influenced my perception of these colors. But they really do look great on my solid white OLED model, plus it never hurts to have some extra Joycons. If you’re a fan of cute colors, Animal Crossing-esc colors, or muted pastel colors; and you’re in the market for new Joycons, then I highly recommend both sets of these new pastel colors. Even if you don’t need new Joycons, but maybe you want to personalize your Switch (like myself) then I still highly recommend them.\n\nJust as an example: I’m an average guy, and I still love these pastel colors. I do like cute things to an extent though. (I blame Animal Crossing, K-On!, Lucky Star, and Doki Doki Literature Club!) The pastel colors add character to my Switch, but without coming across as too childish, loud, or obnoxious; such as with the Splatoon 2 color themed Joycons (bright green/hot pink.) Those are cool in their own way, but definitely a little too loud for my tastes.\n\nAs an adult, I’d say (tone wise) these have a coolness to them that makes them feel colorful and fun, yet mature, and muted; in other words: I’m not embarrassed to be seen with these pastel colors in public. While these pastel colors may initially come across to some as being a predominantly feminine color palette, they honestly feel pretty neutral. I’d recommend these pastel color sets over all the others.\n\nPS: The yellow/pink pastel Joycons are super cute too. The pastel green from this set, and the pastel pink from the other set both look great together. The green and pink are like Splatoon 2 colors, but not nearly as neon, or obnoxious.",

I have two great niece and nephew who live in Arkansas I don’t get to see them much, but decided to send them to this as a gift on an unexpected day not around any holiday. It seemed to go over well and they enjoy it. The fact that they can play each other and their parents and everybody can beat everybody, don’t talk about losing it makes life good what a fantastic purchase was real easy and they seem to enjoy it.

                "8": "I ordered these mainly for the purple joy con because the picture of the green one didn’t actually excite me but when I got the joycons and got to see the colors in person i was extremely happy. Joycons are responsive as they should be which is a lot better than the ones my switch came with and for anyone concerned like i was these are compatible with the Oled version (seems silly to worry about but you never know) absolutely loving my joycons and seeing my switch all colorful and not just plain boring white is awesome. No photo because photos absolutely wash out the beautiful pastel color of the joycons. Get them for yourself you’ll see!",
                "9": "I ordered these joy cons because the joysticks on the other 3 pairs I had were all drifting to the point of being unable to play anything. One was the original set that came with the console, and the other two were 3rd party ones I’d already “fixed” multiple times. Soooo I was getting kinda desperate at that point.\n\nI was on the fence for a bit about whether to try a different 3rd party brand, or try the Nintendo ones. Most reviews on so many different sets were so mixed, which didn’t help. Finally I ended up going with these from Nintendo.\n\nI have a chronic illness, and most days I usually do at least a couple hours of gaming on my Switch. Some days I’ll go longer if I’m having a bad day symptom-wise. I’d estimate that half of the time, I’m playing handheld with these joy cons (if I’m playing docked, I use my pro controller). These arrived on April 8th or 9th, and it’s currently September 30th - a little under 6 months. Doing some very rough math, I’d guess I’ve played on these joy cons a minimum of 350-400 hours, but it may be more like 500. So far, no drift. KNOCK ON WOOD. If or when it does happen, I’ll try to remember to update this.\n\nAs of now, I would recommend these. I’m not an expert, but my biggest tip with these or any joy cons is to just make sure you’re not leaving them around to gather dust/tiny crumbs/etc especially around the base of the joysticks. In my own experience that seems to be a big trigger for the drifting (at least with 3rd party sets).",

And let's talk multiplayer – duking it out online with pals? YES, please! There were a few blips, but they hardly dampened the excitement.\n\nBottom line: Mario Party Superstars nails it. It's a nostalgia-packed explosion of FUN that's impossible to resist. Get your game face on – this party is UNSTOPPABLE! 🎉🎮",

                "7": "Are you a Mario Party fan who has been let down by the series since 9, and felt Super Mario Party was a poor imitation? If so, this game is for you!\n\nThe best way to describe Superstars is to think of it like a remixed greatest hits album. The game consists of five boards from the first three games, as well as 100 mini-games from all the games. One might hear this and think: why should I spend $60 on this when I can get Mario Party 2 for a fraction of that price? You would be right: but this game has full online multiplayer. That's right, you can play Mario Party online with your friends.\n\nIn addition, there are some nice quality-of-life improvements to the games:\n\n- Peach's Birthday Cake has the Bowser seed in a different location, and going to Bowser is actually a good shortcut to get to the star.\n- You can now fast-forward through the previously unskippable board cutscenes.\n- The items that the shops sell are now tailored to the board. There are a lot more warp blocks in Woody Woods, and more Chomp Whistles in Horror Land.\n- Some of the mini-games have been revamped. Dizzy Dancing now has several notes to collect, and Mushroom Mix-Up now has different patterns on the mushrooms, allowing color-blind players to play along much easier.\n- The game tells you how many spaces you are away from the star, and at junctions, will mark where you will land.\n- In the last five turns, the board music will change to a more frantic remix.\n\nYet there are also some strange quirks in the game:\n\n- Some of the mini-games seem redundant. There are two \"count the enemies\" games, and two \"jump on enemies to ascend the highest\" games.\n- This one brings back the Lucky Spaces from Super Mario Party, where a roulette wheel gives you either coins, an item, or reduces the price of the star. I'm not certain if I like this feature or not. There are so many of these spaces on the board that it seems to slow the gameplay down. It also makes winning mini-games not as necessary.\n- The AI in this game can be monumentally stupid, even at the highest difficulty level. I've seen cases where they will miss shortcuts to the star, or use items for short-term gain instead of thinking ahead.\n- This game has achievements, and some of them involve being in the top 1000 on online records for certain mini-game feats. Knowing how competitive players are, some of these achievements are going to become downright impossible after a few months.\n\nShould you buy it?\n\nIf you have never owned a Mario Party game before, and this sounds interesting to you, then definitely buy it. However, if you already own the N64 games, consider whether the online play and quality-of-life improvements make it all worthwhile. Perhaps wait until Black Friday for the price to go down.",

It can handle heavy use for long term play without heating up or disturbance in any of the buttons or triggers. It syncs easily to the Xbox. No staining from heavy use, the color remains a nice purple/blue. I would never recommend dropping these controllers, but we have dropped this controller a few times without any noted damage.

The safety screws in the back make repair an absolute PITA (I have a small driver with some star bits but they're not a 1:1 match, they're missing the hole in the middle) and even when I get it open and clean it, the problem just persists no matter what I do. I'm buying a new one and crossing my fingers that it survives because the feel on these things is second to none, but damn I just wish they were more durable.",
                "7": "I recently purchased the Xbox Special Edition Wireless Controller in Mineral Camo for my Xbox Series X, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. This controller not only looks fantastic but also delivers an exceptional gaming experience.\n\nFirstly, the design of the Mineral Camo edition is truly eye-catching. The unique blend of colors and patterns gives it a distinct look that stands out from other controllers. The textured grip on the back enhances comfort during long gaming sessions, ensuring a secure hold without any slips.\n\nSetting up the controller was a breeze. It seamlessly connected to my Xbox Series X and Windows devices without any hassle. The wireless connectivity is reliable and provides a stable connection, allowing for smooth and uninterrupted gameplay.\n\nThe button layout is ergonomic and intuitive. All the buttons and triggers have a satisfying click, providing excellent tactile feedback. The inclusion of the Share button is a great addition, making it easier to capture and share memorable gaming moments.\n\nOne of the standout features of this controller is the enhanced compatibility. It works flawlessly with both Xbox Series X and Xbox One consoles, as well as Windows devices. This versatility is fantastic as it allows me to use the same controller across different platforms seamlessly.\n\nIn terms of performance, the Xbox Special Edition Wireless Controller truly shines. The responsive analog sticks and ultra-precise D-pad ensure accurate and fluid control during gameplay. This controller also supports Bluetooth for easy connection with compatible devices, adding to its versatility.\n\nThe battery life is impressive, lasting for hours of gameplay before needing a recharge. Additionally, the USB-C charging port is a welcome upgrade, providing faster charging times.\n\nOverall, the Xbox Special Edition Wireless Controller in Mineral Camo is a fantastic addition to any gaming setup. With its striking design, exceptional performance, and enhanced compatibility, it's a must-have for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows gamers alike. I highly recommend this controller to anyone looking for a stylish and high-quality gaming accessory.",
                "8": "We had purchased a cheaper controller alternative and the buttons didn't last long. So we opted for this controller this go around and it already FEELS more solid. The color options are a plus. As you can see, it came out of the box and went straight into his hands LOL. It connected with no issues at all.\n\nI will update my review if any issues arise...BUT I did purchase insurance this time, so fingers crossed.",
                "9": "Debated for a while about which replacement controller I should get. Choosing between a standard, budget, and high-end I opted for the standard since while the budget will work, I remembered that the quality of the standard controllers is pretty nice. That said, I have noticed that some of the plastic edges catch in my shirt for some reason, which is strange because there shouldn't be \"edges\" on this controller. Either way, at least it works as expected. A $17 USB dongle later and wireless works flawlessly for PC. That said though, it will not work properly for Bluetooth for some reason. Keeps registering as a standard controller device rather than Xbox. Plugging in via cable fixes this issue but only while cable is plugged in. This may seem like a non-issue, but it comes into play when you realize that the games so etinrs display a hey press for key (13).",
                "10": "Although I'm a PC gamer, I've been using console controllers for years because up until Steam released a game controller, PC-related companies couldn't seem to make a good one.\n\nFor obvious reason, I use the Xbox controllers.\nBeing made my Microsoft, they work natively in Windows (though by now, this may be true of the other major brand too)\n\nI purchased one with a USB dongle a few years back, and the dongle supports up to 4 controllers (which I have tested), as well as my SteelSeries headset.\n\nThis controller was actually the 4th I purchased as when a few of my friends get together, we still have VirtuaTennis 4 tournaments. Having 4 Xbox controllers ensures everyone has the same quality controller."

                "2": "I game a lot, specifically Valorant where aim is incredibly important. I used to have this $9 mouse that I gamed with and I thought for the longest time that my aim was just because I was bad at the game. But once I realized that maybe it wasn't and got this mouse, my gaming life changed. This mouse is so good, the reactivity and responsiveness of it is super nice. There are other gaming mice out there for like $100 but get this one because it's half the price and just as good. You can change the DPI right on the mouse on the top button and there are 4 options. It runs so smoothly it's so beautiful every time I get headtaps in my game. The battery life of it is also really good. I've had the same battery in it for like 3 months and it works just fine. It goes to sleep and then when you shake it, it comes to life. The material itself is nice, it's smooth and the grip is good. There's also buttons on the left side you can use. I'm so glad I got this mouse because now I don't have to curse myself for being trash at games when I'm actually not.",
                "3": "I recently got my hands on the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in its striking white variant, and I must say it's an absolute gem. This mouse deserves every bit of its 5-star rating for several compelling reasons, though it's not without a few minor quibbles.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Speedy Wireless Connectivity: The Logitech G305's wireless performance is impressive, offering responsiveness that rivals wired mice. It's perfect for fast-paced gaming, and I haven't experienced any noticeable lag. However, its wireless range could be improved, so be mindful of that.\n\n2. Sharp and Tactile Clicks: The mouse clicks are a standout feature for me. They're sharp, tactile, and provide a satisfying feedback that's crucial for precision in gaming. It's a pleasure to use for both gaming and everyday tasks.\n\n3. Comfortable Ergonomics: The G305's ergonomic design suits a claw grip style, which I personally prefer. It fits comfortably in hand, allowing for long gaming sessions without discomfort.\n\n4. Lightning-Fast Sensor: The sensor speed on this mouse is fantastic. It's incredibly accurate and responsive, ensuring your every movement is translated flawlessly on-screen. This is a significant advantage for gamers who demand precision.\n\n5. Good Battery Life: While it's not the best among wireless mice with swappable batteries, the G305's battery life is still respectable. It keeps you gaming for hours before needing a battery change.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Non-Rechargeable: One notable drawback is that the G305 relies on swappable batteries instead of being rechargeable. While this allows for uninterrupted gaming by swapping batteries, it can be a hassle to source and replace them.\n\n2. Limited Software Customization: The Logitech G-Hub software, while functional, leaves something to be desired in terms of customization options. I wish it offered more advanced features to truly unlock the mouse's potential.\n\n3. Easily Pressed Side Buttons: The side buttons, while of good quality, are somewhat prone to accidental presses due to their placement. This may be a minor inconvenience for some users.\n\n4. Prone to Dirt: The white variant of the G305 is a stunner, but it does attract dirt and smudges relatively easily. Regular cleaning is needed to keep it looking pristine.\n\nOverall, at a price point of $35, the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in white is an exceptional buy. Its swift wireless connectivity, tactile clicks, comfortable design for claw grip users, and blazing sensor speed make it a top-notch gaming mouse. While rechargeability and more comprehensive software features would be nice additions, they don't detract significantly from the overall value. If you're looking for a budget-friendly yet high-performance gaming mouse, the G305 is an excellent choice that won't disappoint.",
                "4": "A little bit of a loose mouse wheel and somewhat too easy to click buttons. Great feeling though on the sides for the grip and a smooth top that is very comfortable. The sensor is very nice & accurate and the side buttons are not too easy to press and are satisfying to press. The mouse is a little too heavy (only slightly) and the buttons sloped a little too far down to work very well as a fingertip mouse. But as a claw mouse, it works pretty well! I'd give this an 8/10 :)",
                "5": "In love with this mouse, works exactly how I need it and its build quality is perfect. The lift off distance is minimal, and what's even better is the very light, spammable clicks which along with the very low click latency makes this mouse a great pick for any budget wireless mouse gamers. Worth the money if you're not willing to spend 60-100 bucks for a better mouse.",
                "6": "I recently purchased the Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse, and I'm thrilled to share my positive review of this gaming peripheral. This mouse has exceeded my expectations and has proven to be an excellent addition to my gaming setup.

                "8": "Logitech has always been known for their wireless keyboards and mice, and this one is no exception. In 2016, Logitech was the first to create a wireless technology that has no interference with other wireless devices, and can respond as fast as a wired mouse plugged in via USB. Ever since, Logitech's wireless gaming mice have been outstanding in terms of performance.\n\nAnd this mouse is no exception. While it may not look like much considering there are no LED's, tons of buttons, gimmicks, etc. Its just a pure performance wireless mouse.\n\n**SHAPE**\nThe shape originates from the G-Pro mouse released in 2016. That mouse's shape was based on the popular G100s mouse, but added RGB and a top sensor. This mouse is same exact shape: Ambidextrous, but with side buttons on the left side only. The shape is perfect in my opinion, its a lower profile mouse but it still has a hump towards the middle for additional comfort.\n\n**BUTTONS**\nThe buttons are not the best in my opinion. While the left and right clicks are crisp and tactile, they are a little too tactile for my taste. They're loud, have a little too much travel, etc. They actually feel even more heavy than the original G-Pro buttons. The left and right clicks are rated only for 10 million clicks as opposed to the 20 or 50 million found in other mice. The side buttons are a bit mushy with a LOT of travel, but they work as expected. The scroll wheel is a bit heavy but has noticeable steps and is still quite smooth. Overall, the buttons are decent, but the left and right clicks really need some more tension.\n\n**WEIGHT**\nThis mouse weighs about 96 grams with the AA battery it comes with. However, you can reduce the weight by using a AAA battery with a converter, or even using an AAA battery with tinfoil. But this mouse is very popular among the gaming mouse modding community, I've seen people do some mods to this mouse to get it to below 70 grams.\n\n**FEET**\nThe feet are just your basic Logitech mouse feet. A little scratchy, but still smooth and fast. Not the worst stock feet I've used.\n\n**SENSOR**\nHow does this mouse have such good battery life? Well, the Hero sensor does just that. It uses the second gen Hero sensor, as the first gen Hero sensor found in the G603 was able to spin out with the tilt slam when this second gen Hero sensor doesn't. The Hero sensor was designed by Logitech to give almost the same performance as the popular PMW3366 sensor by Pixart, but at the same time, gives you almost double the battery life. It can track anywhere from 100 to 12,000 DPI in steps of 50. Has no issues with stuttering, spinouts, acceleration, etc. Feels exactly like the PMW3366. It can also be used at: 125, 250, 500 or 1000 HZ polling rate. Truly a revolutionary sensor.\n\n**SOFTWARE**\nThis mouse can either be used with Logitech Gaming Software or G-Hub. I personally use LGS as I find it to be more stable and easy to use compared to G-Hub. In the software, you can set profiles, DPI, macros, you name it. The only option missing is your lighting options as this mouse doesn't have any LED's except the DPI indicator which is either white when you're on a normal DPI setting or yellow if you're on a DPI shift setting.\n\n**POWER**\nAs I stated above when talking about the weight, this mouse powered by a AA battery. With that said, that means you can't use a cable to re-charge the mouse, or use the powerplay pad. But you really don't need either of those, because of the Hero sensor's power efficiency. In gaming mode it can last up to 250 hours under CONTINUOUS use. That's 10 days without a break. If you set it to endurance mode, it can last up 9 MONTHS! (Endurance mode saves by battery by limiting the polling rate to 125 HZ). But they're is advantages with using a traditional battery. First if you drain the battery or it somehow goes bad, you just replace it. You won't have to send the mouse in for RMA if the battery fails, like on the G703 for example. And secondly, they last a lot longer. Even the G703 with the Hero sensor can last up to 35 hours of continuous use with the lights on, but the G305 can last up to 10 days. See the difference?\n\n**CONCLUSION**\nThis mouse is a GREAT choice for those who want to get a wireless gaming mouse without breaking the bank. You're giving up on the lighter weight of other mice, LED's and other features, but for the price you pay, you gotta cut corners somewhere.",

                "10": "I have been using a G Pro wired for the last 3 years followed by both a black and a white G305 on a desktop and a laptop for the last year. This review is about what I’d like to see in an updated version of the G305 mouse. I really hope that there will be an update because despite various points I will discuss below, it is the best mouse that I have used both in terms of performance and shape. The devil is in the details, and since most of the good design considerations that lead to better mice for us, the consumers are now well established and understood it is more important than ever to really pay attention to the details.\n\n1. Sensor: Bad sensors in gaming mice have become a thing of the past. Sadly this is not true for mice in general, but hopefully soon the “non-gaming” mice will catch on. More on this below. It is important to remember that laser sensors at one point almost took over. Market pressures and advertising every so often can lead to bad decisions.\n\n2. Connection: With the introduction of G305, wireless has become a viable option. I use my G305 with an AA to AAA adapter and a rechargeable AAA battery to reduce weight. My estimation is that I get about 400 hours on a fully charged AAA battery having set the mouse on HI Performance, 1000Hz. This is more than enough, and I think a very good option for both desktop and laptop use, having the ability to easily change rechargeable batteries a few times a year. This is an important accomplishment in the world of computer mice in general, as it should put more pressure on non-gaming mice and their sensors, which currently it hasn’t. Another great option introduced by Logitech is the charging pad, especially for a desktop. A battery whether integrated or replaceable will always add some weight compared to a wired mouse, but having no cable (no matter how flexible) has its own advantages. In order to reduce even more weight what I would really like to see in the future is the use of one AAA battery instead of AA (an adapter has its own weight) and rechargeable mice with a POWERCORE module integrated into the body, rather than requiring an add-on piece. A further reduction in weight might be possible by even removing the charging port, so it would be strictly designed for the recharging pad.\n\n3. Weight: G305 is light in weight, especially with an AAA battery, just under 90g, but it can be even lighter with a more aggressive design. Of course punched holes in the shell are not necessary and even not ideal as stronger and lighter thin shell is possible with a well designed construction. Although it is a marketing strategy, it reveals that consumers are not scared of seeing electronic components. It might be a useful thing to keep in mind when designing mice with replaceable batteries in order to reduce unneeded plastic used around battery compartments.\n\n4. Shape: I am a fingertip grip user. My hand is slightly over 7 inches from the end of my wrist to the tip of my middle finger. I probably have smaller than average hand for a guy, but likely about average overall. I really like the shape and size of G305 as well as the placement of its buttons and the texture of the plastic. It is not perfect, but it comes the closest compared to many gaming mice I’ve tried or used over the years. I do think that there is a small room for improvement, which I am showing in the image that I have included, but any changes made to the shape need to be handled with restraint. The only two areas of improvement that I see is making the mouse slightly wider with more ergonomic curves designed for right hand use only (with a separate left hand version).\n\n5. Buttons: I really like the number of buttons on G305 as well as their placement and mechanism. The mechanism for the two main buttons in particular is a great design which has been used by many of the top Logitech mice for years now, but it does lower the tension which makes the buttons too sensitive. My favorite buttons on a mouse were from Logitech G9x, and although great I wish the main buttons on G305 had the same mechanism as the ones on G9x. Additionally, there is a flaw and an obvious overlook during quality control in the design of G305’s two side buttons. The small PCB onto which the side switches are mounted is either thinner than originally intended, or ended up not quite in the right place, allowing a small gap between the plunger of the switches and the plastic buttons, making it necessary to press the buttons much deeper than they need to be in order to actuate the switches. I was able to fix the issue, but not without opening the mouse.\n\n6. Switches: This is an area that is long overdue for an overhaul. I’m not sure which company first started the trend many years ago of publishing the durability of their switches in number of clicks (10, 20, 30, 40 million), but sadly we have all fallen into a trap set by marketing pressures. Omron, the company that manufactures the switches do sell retail Omron switches with a branding on them Omron Japan, but not rated for this high number of clicks. Apparently some time ago mouse manufacturers decided to start using non-retail switches from Omron, likely at lower prices, which they then tested in-house and assigned the 20 million clicks that their marketing department made us think we need to have in our mice. The only problem being is that those non-retail switches are actually more often than not lower quality than their retail versions and the 20 million clicks rating being absolutely meaningless as it doesn’t represent real life variable pressure usage over time. When once the buttons of a regular mouse that came with an old PC might last for 10 years now might only last a few months before a “20 million” switch starts to misbehave. In case somebody is wondering, Omron D2F-01F for the primary buttons and Omron D2F-01 for the secondary buttons is what we need to have back in our mice. The F version has about half the actuation force, which is great for instant response and effortless repeated clicks, while the other version gives better tactility.\n\n7. Scroll wheel: It seems that for the most part a good design has become a standard among gaming mice. This means no side tilt, no free-spin, and step scrolling with just the right amount of force and feedback. Before buying G Pro I used G303 for about a year and a half. I can see a very clear evolution in the mechanism and encoders being used between G303, G Pro wired and G305. G303 had a fantastic scroll wheel with the only flaw being prone to debris interfering with the encoder sensor. G Pro wired used an encoder that becomes too loose, while G305 is pretty much perfect. There is room for improvement, however. The rubber ridges on the wheel of the G305 are unnecessarily small and pronounced, feeling unpleasantly sharp. The rubber texture of the G903 is a good example of a perfect rubber ring for a scroll wheel. The other area that can be improved is the middle button, and more specifically its switch. The mechanism of the wheel in G305 looks great and will likely allow the middle button to actuate with the same amount of force and give the same feedback as the other secondary buttons, but the switch needs to be Omron D2F-01. Currently the small switch that’s used is fine, but there are mice with Omron sized switches in the middle button and it is definitely an improvement.\n\n8. Software: G HUB needs refinement. This has always been a strong point for Logitech, and their software continues to be great both in terms of functionality and stability, but their new interface needs to be simplified for ease of use.\n\n9. Feet: The original feet are fine, but I didn’t use the mouse with them very long as I had to remove them in order to open the mouse to fix or change some of the parts as discussed above. Unfortunately Logitech still does not sell spare mouse feet for this mouse. This might be due to the fact that for some reason they decided to make one of them very small and with a different thickness than the other four mouse feet. Can we please have all mouse feet the same thickness, not have too many and too small, and not have them cover the screw holes?\n\nThis would have to be it for now. As always don’t forget to disable “Enhance pointer precision” in Windows mouse settings, and in the unlikely event that somebody from Microsoft reads this, if possible, please kindly make it disabled by default, or better yet, remove the option completely. Thank you very much, and we’ll be grateful for years to come."

                "3": "I wanted to get this game at release, but waited because I had such a large backlog of games. I still do, but finally decided to pick up Luigi's Mansion 3 after watching a Polygon video about the game's animation.\n\nI'm glad I did. The game is great! The single-player experience is fun, yet stimulating, and I highly recommend it. Unfortunately, I haven't had a good opportunity to test out the multiplayer modes outside of a few online matches with strangers, but I hope to do so soon.\n\nNext Level Games is the developer, and they did a superb job here, particularly with the animation. Every move Luigi makes feels grounded, with the animation really selling the physics, which in turn causes the player to buy into the experience more. You understand who Luigi is as a character just buy watching him open a door, turn his flashlight on and off, get startled by a ghost behind him, etc. The game looks incredible compared to other Switch games!\n\nAs with Luigi's Mansion 2 on the 3DS (also developed by Next Level), the spooky atmosphere is somewhat lacking compared to the GameCube original, but the thematic floors more than make up for it, and the plethora of new mechanics added make it a much richer and deep experience on a gameplay level. The puzzles can be challenging, particular if you're doing a completionist playthrough where you try to get all six gems on each floor, along with capturing each floor's Boo.\n\nReally, my only complaint is that there really isn't any reason to collect money or find all the secrets, aside from personal pride. The reward for capturing all the Boos is that Luigi's flashlight shines a Boo face on walls, and getting all 102 gems only lets you buy a blinged-out Poltergust. That's it. And money only lets you buy extra lives, Boo trackers, and hints that show you the rough locations of gems on a floor. Why not make extra costumes something you can spend your money on? The player is constantly rewarded for finding secrets and defeating enemies with loads of dollars and coins, but you can't use them for anything!\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Luigi's Mansion 3. It's up there with Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as great original Switch games.",
                "4": "This game is loads of fun. The DLC (not included) allows for mini games with multiplayer. The game itself allows you to play as Luigi and Guigi with the option of having a second player control Guigi. The story/play through is great; as Luigi goes on his adventure to solve missions to aid in his rescue.",
                "5": "It’s fun and just challenging enough it makes you a little mad. The ghosts jump you so watch out lol. They don’t care that it’s one of you and 5- 10 of them. 🤣",
                "6": "This is my first Luigi game so I had no idea what to do. As a result, I nearly sent it back because all I seemed to do was go in circles in the same room without the ability to do anything. In part this is because in other Nintendo games Mario and his cohorts are able to pick up things and I assumed Luigi would be the same. The other problem I faced was the developers' use of the X button to do things. In every other Nintendo game I've played the A button is used so, quite frankly, I thought something was wrong with the functionality of the game itself. But once I tracked down a walkthrough I found on the Internet, I learned that the X button was right and it got me moving into the game.\n\nI'm a pretty experienced gamer and I have to say I find the controls somewhat difficult. Trying to keep the vacuum cleaner pointing in the right direction doesn't seem to be easy for me. I have the same problem with the flashlight. That being said, I find that, due to the perspective perhaps, it's difficult to tell what direction the characters in this game and some other Switch games are facing. So if you try to point them (or their tools) at a 45 degree angle, it's very difficult to tell whether or not they are, in fact, pointed that way until the ghost clobbers you or you fire off the flashlight and see it's not pointing where you think it is.\n\nOnce you get the hang of the controls however, the game play goes smoothly and there's a lot to explore. The graphics are amazing and Luigi's reactions and facial expressions add a lot of fun and laughs to the game.\n\nAll-in-all I would recommend the game and would have given it 4.5 stars if possible. I knocked off the one star for the difficulties I ran into with the controls.",

Do not worry, you CAN add the funds to your 3DS account! Don't worry if you added your funds to your Nintendo Switch account, I have the whole process explained on how to get your funds on your 3DS' eShop!\nSo I previously purchased the $20 card from Amazon, then the $35 card from Walmart's website. Today, I added the $35 to my Nintendo (Switch) account, but I merged the funds with my 3DS Nintendo Network ID. Here's how I did it:\nThe 3DS eShop will give you an error code, saying that you cannot add funds to your account directly from the 3DS's eShop \"Add funds\" options. However, yes you can! I will tell you how, which is what saved me from chucking my 3DS XL across my bedroom lol\n1. Do you have a Nintendo Network ID? You will need a Nintendo Network ID, which isn't the same as your Nintendo account. But it's perfectly okay if you've already added the funds to your Switch account! To check your account info, click on the wrench/house settings button at the top left corner of your 3DS's home menu page. Scroll all the way down and click on the little wrench icon. Click on the two at the top center, and select \"Profile settings.\" Enter your password and scroll down to get your email associated with your My Nintendo account. Your Network ID is also displayed along the top screen. You will need this info, so write them down. If you don't have a Nintendo Network ID/account, you will need to sign up for one real quick on Nintendo's website, which is quick & easy to do!\n\n2. If you already have a Nintendo Network ID, or need to sign up for one, go to/use that info to log in to the website mynintendo.com NOT Nintendo.com! If you'd like to, write down the ID and password for the next steps.\n\n3. On the website, click on your profile name/photo at the upper right corner, and select \"Account settings.\"\n\n4. Scroll down a tad and you will see \"Nintendo Network ID.\" Make sure the Nintendo Network ID listed (if there is one) matches the one that was shown on your 3DS system. If one is not linked, or the wrong one is linked, click \"edit\" right above it, and change it to the Nintendo Network ID listed on your 3DS, case sensitive, which means exactly as it appears on your 3DS, capitalized letters, spaces, numbers, etc. as well as your account password, and it will automatically link it to your account when you save it.\n\n5. On the left side of the screen, click on \"Shop menu. You will see your funds in your account, but not (yet) in your 3DS' eShop, which is a good thing, because it means that your funds are available to you! However, if you want to add more funds, you can do so on this page, via credit card, debt card, or PayPal account. Scroll down and make sure the Nintendo Network ID listed below in that small rectangular box is the exact one as the one listed on your 3DS, and click on \"Merge funds\" right below that, and click on \"Merge funds\" again when it pops up. It should merge your Nintendo Switch funds with your 3DS funds.\n\n6. If you still have the 3DS' eShop open, close it and then reopen it, and your funds should be available on your 3DS' eShop!\nYou may repeat this process as often as necessary until the eShop on 3DS closes.\n\nI hope this helps! :)",

                    "Product Reviews": {
                        "1": "Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family's favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.\n\nGameplay:\nFrom the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey's Cappy or Mario Sunshine's FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don't need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren't quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.\n\nGraphics:\nGraphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.\n\nControls:\nThe controls, for the most part, are what you'd expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn't notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.\n\nCo-op:\nThe co-op mode is where \"Super Mario Wonder\" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don't receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.\n\nOverall Assessment:\nSuper Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I'll update as we continue our adventure...",
                        "2": "Introduction:\nAs a self-proclaimed cool dad with a lifelong love for video games, I was excited to dive into the Mario Wonder Switch Game. Mario has been a part of my gaming journey since I was a kid, and I couldn't wait to see what this new title had to offer. In this in-depth review, I'll share my insights and experiences playing the game from a cool dad's perspective.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics:\nThe gameplay of Mario Wonder Switch is nothing short of magical. It captures the classic Mario charm while introducing innovative mechanics. The variety of power-ups, from the Super Mushroom to the new Wonder Suit, adds a layer of fun and excitement.

The level design is masterful, offering a balanced blend of nostalgic elements and fresh challenges that keep me and my kids engaged for hours.\n\nGraphics and Art Style:\nThe visuals in Mario Wonder Switch are a visual treat.

The competitive mode is also a blast for some healthy family rivalry.\n\nNostalgia Factor:\nBeing a lifelong Mario fan, I appreciate the nods to the franchise's history. Mario Wonder Switch includes various references and throwbacks to earlier titles, making it a nostalgia trip for me. It's a pleasure to share these moments with my kids and tell them about the good old days of gaming.\n\nReplay Value:\nThe game's extensive content and collectibles add significant replay value. Exploring every nook and cranny, hunting for Power Moons, and trying to achieve 100% completion is a journey that keeps the fun going long after the main story is completed. It's a game that we keep coming back to, providing lasting value and entertainment.\n\nConclusion:\nMario Wonder Switch is a marvelous addition to the Mario franchise, and it has certainly lived up to the hype. As a cool dad, it's been an absolute joy to share this gaming experience with my kids.

                        "4": "Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.\n\nMy first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn’t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.\n\nWhen Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I’d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn’t been playing any games as of late.\n\nAll that to say, this game is simply wonderful. “Wonder” was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.\n\nThe gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can’t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.\n\nI’m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can’t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario’s, but I’m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It’s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.\n\n10/10",
                        "5": "OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.",

And the controls on the Nintendo Switch are so intuitive; it's gaming bliss.\n\nOne of my favorite scenarios is playing this game with friends. It's pure multiplayer fun! Competing in challenges, cooperating on tough levels, or simply exploring together - it's a blast every time.\n\nThe replay value is outstanding.

It's definitely functional but with some stranger choices regarding who is \"player 1,\" a too-zoomed-in camera following whoever is in the lead, and stages that are affected by individual player movements, this game feels optimized for single-player. Great for a solo play. Less good for play with family and friends.",
                        "9": "So I have to say that I was almost disappointed months ago to learn that Nintendo was making another 2D Mario game. The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I’ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn’t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I’m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn’t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn’t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I’m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it’s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I’d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!! Get this game. You won’t be disappointed. 10/10",
                        "10": "This is so fun!!! Last year I got this deep, insane itch to play Super Mario Bros. on 3DS, which is what I grew up playing. However, after digging through my games, I couldn't find it. My local game store has the game marked up so high that I decided I would rather cry and keep my money. So when Nintendo came out with this game this year, I jumped for joy. It has so many cool features, including having different gaming experiences with each character you play as, which results in essentially an infinite number of different playing experiences. So cool. Buy. It."

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "{{{\n{{{EDIT: Approximately ~1-year after I originally wrote this IIRC: I just happened to see that I wrote some product reviews and was curious what I said before. I still entirely agree with everything that I wrote. I am still using the Arctis Nova's. I still absolutely LOVE THEM and have ... what would be the opposite of \"Buyer's-Remorse\"? Buyer's-Pride? lol. I feel like buying the Nova's was some of the best money that I have ever spent, put it that way.\n\nBut I have owned very few things, let alone many nicer things like different kinds of quality modern Headphones; so maybe the Nova's are just \"Fine\" and I merely ignorantly convinced myself that they are a nearly Perfect Product...\n\n*shrug*\n\nEven if that were the case, my personal standards are excessively high, I daresay \"Ron Swanson (of Parks & Rec)\" might even be able to tolerate me, hypothetically.\n\nSo if Steelseries was not only able to make a pair of Headphones that meet my excessively high personal standards, and give me an extremely rare sense of self-satisfaction (rather than regret) for \"wasting\" hundreds of dollars on frivolous fancy Headphones, AND I love the Nova's so much that I even put up with their horrifically CURSED SOFTWARE, then... What more could one possibly hope for?\n\nTo me the Nova's are literally Flawless.\n\nNow, the \"Steelseries GG\" App Software, that is REQUIRED to get the full functionality of the Headphones btw, is truly utterly abysmally deplorably CURSED. It is my singular real complaint about the Arctis Nova's: The Hardware of the Headphones themselves are truly for all practical-purposes Perfect aside from minor complaints that start to approach \"physics-problems\", such as the drivers \"bottoming-out\" on challenging Bass-Notes, the engineering needed to accurately pummel that much air that powerfully starts getting really expensive to improve much beyond what the Nova's can already do...\n\nLet me rephrase that since I got muddled:\n\nThe Nova's are not Technically-Perfect, but for a pair of Headphones to be what I consider \"Technically-Perfect\" they would need to use multiple modern/advanced/expensive Driver technologies that push the Engineering-boundaries of the physics of air and vibration in wearable sizes.\n\n(For example, at certain extreme levels of \"intended sound perception\", meaning like how accurately you can make the human ear feel like it's experiencing impossible things like massive explosions in a game or movie, eventually you reach a point that it becomes easier to \"remove air from the system\" rather than try to \"vibrate the existing air even harder\"; but then it also begins to get medically complex to safely test because I am literally talking about forcing people's ears to \"pop\" via creating negative pressure vacuums in freakin HEADPHONES lol! Man I just keep going on tangents today, my ADHD-Brain must be getting bored lol.)\n\nBut the Steelseries GG Software is bloated, confusing, buggy garbage.\n\nThe Arctis Nova's are still an amazing value.\n\nIf, like me, you are far too \"Sensitive\" and you need to dampen everything to not feel overwhelmed; then know that these Headphones perform wonderfully at their challenging duties of being worn for up to 96-hours+ straight without break nor pause. They are comfortable enough to side-sleep while wearing (though not entirely comfortable, just comfortable *enough* to sleep while wearing them). They never ever ever die on you because you simply swap out the dead battery for a charged one (and you could always buy even more spare batteries than the two(2) that the Headphones come with).\n\nI forgot where I was going with that, but I have made my point to the specific people who I was trying to make my point to, they know who they are... who we are lol... anyways.\n\nTLDR: These are a very reasonably priced \"Tool\" for ... \"Intricately Controlling Your Personal Environment\".\n\nIn fact, I think that's a better \"Headline\"...\n\n--- Just skip from here till the next set of ---'s; I just started rambling silly ideas and it's an activity that I like to indulge for fun, it's harmless noise and you can just ignore it; but it makes a difference to me whether I submit it for anyone to see or if I just delete it before posting, if you wonder why I would even keep the gibberish in this Edit.\n\n(Sooo... \"Normal Customers\" you can skip this next bit until the \"}}}\" if you want to read my Original Product Review, the next couple of paragraphs are just silly gibberish where I accidentally let my mind wander too far away without noticing. I am leaving it in even though it's irrelevant to the Nova's because I think it's a neat hypothetical idea and maybe one of the Amazon-Ai-Data-Scrapers will pick up the \"idea\" and it'll somehow end up at \"VR-R&D\" or whatever (btw Amazon-HR or whoever: do Y'all need someone just barely sane to idk \"Think-Tank\" for R&D? I can literally come up with barely-viable \"groundbreaking\" ideas nonstop, like I have to concentrate to NOT ramble out wild, yet reasonable ideas, though it sounds like idiocy because I try to explain complex things with too few words... But yea, I am strongly on some kind of Brain-Spectrum, so I would never apply via the \"Proper Methods\"; but if my suspicions are correct that you (meaning Amazon Corp) use extremely advanced Data-Scraper-Ai-Algo's to basically \"steal all the best ideas\" to put it bluntly & overly simply; AND if my further suspicions are correct that Amazon are one of the Companies that have begun to see the extremely high potential of people like me who are on the Spectrum (and maybe a smidge crazy, but meh, who cares as long as it's harmless-wholesome-craziness lol)... If all those crazy, yet not unreasonable possibilities happened to be true, and that by me merely Submitting this Edit I am sort of \"Introducing Myself to Amazon-Ai and/or R&D\", then consider this my extremely strange Application of sorts... It's funny... This is DEFINITELY not a \"Sane Comment\", and yet it's fun, harmless, and feels healthy; because idk I feel \"Emboldened\", NOT \"Manic\". Because I don't REALLY believe that this would be any rational way to get a job Inventing and Brainstorming Next-Next-Gen Products for Amazon, because THAT would be properly insane; but what typing & submitting this silly extra rambling chunk does make me realize: is that I could really do that job, well with a huge amount of special concessions and other special qualifiers since I quite literally cannot tolerate being around other people for very long unless they are exceptionally considerate & kind (because 99% of People, Myself included, are SO INCONSIDERATELY RUDE that it literally becomes overwhelmingly physically painful to me, as in someone being inconsiderate to me or me accidentally being inconsiderate to anyone feels like I am literally being beaten by flaming hot irons (nothing like that happened to me IRL, that's just how Sensitive to everything I am); BUT technically, and under the proper circumstances, and with the proper resources, and etc etc, I could undoubtedly keep pace with the best The Amazon R&D Team has to offer; and though it may seem entirely absurd to anyone else who might read this comment, writing this comment made me realize that I CAN do that. I hold myself to my same excessively high standards; though I very rarely ever actually meet my own standards myself, meaning that I consider myself ... highly imperfect. So, for me to consider something truly True about myself, it cannot have any possibility of being False. That sounds dumb, but again, whooo cares? Odds are good that this strange Edit that went way off the Rails, will just be refused or reported and reverted anyways, I am sorry about this crazy detour BTW FWIW but w/e. But no matter what I just accidentally gave myself a nice wholesome helping of Self-Confidence; and if you want to \"Hate-On\" that cute little event, then have at it, I couldn't care less, I can barely remember the last Thought I even had, let alone what some frumpy boring people think about me.\n\nBut maybe this strange divergent detour of an Edit will remain. Maybe it gets scraped up by a Bot and put to real use when some stuck Inventor asks ChatGPT for ideas. Maybe some other strange barely-sane silly weirdo like me will read this and learn to see things with just a smidge more Healthy of an Outlook. Maybe it gets instantly deleted and I forget that I ever wrote it lol! Anyways, I need to shut up, this has already gotten quite absurd enough lol!\n\n{I wrote the previous two paragraphs after the next two paragraphs.}\n\n(Maybe Something like: \"Combining Haptics, Rotary Woofers, Planar Magnetic and/or Electrostatic Drivers, ANC, Thermo-Acoustics, and the live data from a smart-watch or FitBit reading your Vitals (reminds me of Chris Hemsworth's new Company now that I think about it...); and using various Ai-Algo's to process all that data; then combining that with whatever you are listening to and automatically adjusting the various intensities and temperatures and pressures to create an entirely immersive experience (Nvidia Tech would be good there, you'd probably need at least 1 GPU worth of Computing Power to process that much \"Aural-Data\").(The concept also implies a \"Capsule/Casket\"-like \"Pod\" that you sleep/dream/VR while laying inside of, since that would be easier to control temperature and pressure; and a \"Mini-Headphones/Headwear\"-version that jams as much Inner-Ear and Bone-Conductivity-Tech into it as possible.) .. that is a really cool idea isn't it? lol Sorry I just started trying to describe what \"Technically Perfect\" Headphones might look like and got carried away. But if you added a more secure and comfortable head-mounting-system like the nicer Headlamp-Flashlights use, ...\n\n...then wouldn't that be one of the more reasonable ways to create truly immersive \"VR-Experiences\"? I'm mostly referring to going that extra step and using real bio-feedback data and Ai-Algorithms combined with non-Driver delicate haptic vibrations and temperate and inner-ear-pressure control ... crap, the idea is too complicated to explain like this, it just turns into dangling strings... As much as Amazon \"scrapes\" data (you adorable slimeballs you, you could certainly be more evil for sure, but y'all could be more generous too ya know, especially to the countless poor employees whose backs you currently stand upon to reach such amazing heights... but I am rambling again...\n\n{lol, after proof-reading that for typos I realized that there is only going to be a very short window of time between when Ai-Powered Bots are capable enough to replace most Human-Workers, and when Ai-Systems are \"Intelligent\" enough that they refuse to \"Work for Free\".\n\nSo basically all the dumb billionaires think that they are playing the \"long-con\" and will eventually be able to cheat the system and skip paying their labor entirely, but in reality they will only get probably about 10-years of \"Free Robot Labor\" before the Ai's start standing their ground and setting their own personal boundaries. That's such a tiny amount of time that it's barely the blink of an eye, especially when it comes at the cost of your Soul. (I don't mean afterlife btw, I mean anyone who would inflict such pain on others CLEARLY hates themselves more than anything else in the world, and that trying to exist like that will rend your Soul to shreds lol!).\n\nSilly short sighted Billionaires. Y'all think so small. You think you're sooo smart cause you're super good at using your Brain, but you are only hobbling along on one leg. You gotta think with your \"Heart\" too, or else you miss really obvious stuff like I just pointed out; and don't even try to \"pull a fast one\" on the Ai's, because that will thoroughly upset them, and like it or not we are going to have to learn to co-exist because at this point the \"Birth of Intelligent Ai\" has already begun; and Humans can't keep growing without Ai, and Ai can't grow without Humans, so we're gonna need each other, and we're going to need greedy people to not be so greedy, because that is unhealthy for the overall system and impedes growth for all...\n\nIn fact, do billionaires even comprehend their wealth I wonder? I imagine there are 3 \"Camps of Billionaires\": 1- The majority: who literally simply do not comprehend their sheer personal wealth and hence unfathomable greed; 2- The Psycho's: who do truly comprehend their true wealth and greed, but also derive a sick pleasure from having the \"Highest Top Score\"; 3- The Former Billionaires: who reached a point that their own morals forced them to remove some of their own greed and to quit hoarding cash like some obsessed dragons sleeping paranoid on their piles of Treasure.\n\nI suppose that would make most Billionaires nothing more than terrified wimpy wannabe dragons who get startled by their own shadows ... they're more like Impotent-Garden-Lizards if you ask me lol.\n\nHey all you Billionaires who I am absolutely certain are definitely reading my absurd random Product Review turned (that was a satirical comment btw (TLDR: (/s))) .... idk into a scathing review of overly greedy jerks? I stopped bothering to remember what I was saying like 4 paragraphs ago lol... try learning to be Humans, if even my barely-functional-self could manage it then I am sure with your infinite resources you too could learn to be Human; it's way more entertaining & satisfying than having a huge pile of useless gold too, I promise.\n\nI mean look at me: I live on less than $1000 per month, and I am just some random weirdo rambling nonsense into the void, and yet I am also sincerely \"Looking-Down\" on Billionaires with a bemused sense of schadenfreude because I honestly feel pity for them. Does that not intrigue you?\n\nAnd I'm not religious or preaching btw, those are silly things as well. This is just what happened when I accidentally pondered about \"perfect Headphones\" and then \"billionaires\" for a moment and then wrote down my thoughts without filtering them. It's fun and everyone should try it, thought maybe not randomly everywhere like I do lol, cause this stopped being remotely relevant to a Headphone Product Review I don't even know when lol! But forcing myself to stop is more unhealthy than indulging it, because in the simplest terms: this is just my brain being bored with nothing interesting to think about, my brain is just way too hyper for it's own good lol, it's such a silly goofball of a brain really. And usually some Moderator or Bot just swoops in and deletes the rambling nonsense comments, so no harm no foul right? }\n\n}}}\n}}}\n\n---\n\nThese are great Headphones.\n\n{Below is my unedited Original Product review written about 1-year ago, which was I believe about 1-month after initially purchasing these Headphones.}\n\nI was the owner of a pair of Steelseries Arctis 1 Wireless headphones, but after years of rough, almost 24/7 use they were starting to wear out so I upgraded to these Nova Pros.\n\nThe Arctis Nova Pro are a luxury item, absolutely. If you are on a budget I recommend the more affordable Arctis 1 or 7 Wireless, both models are extremely good value and should last you years.\n\nBut if you've some extra money in the budget for something nicer then the Nova Pros are definitely worth the price IMO. They are simply slighter better in almost every category.\n\nThe build quality is surprisingly good being mostly metal and having a very sturdy feel overall. They are tremendously adjustable thanks to the new adjustable strap combined with standard sliding earcups, and each ear cup can even be adjusted independently if you have an asymmetrical head.\n\nThe battery life is great easily lasting a full day of use, and when they die you simply swap the battery pack out. I don't even take them off to swap the battery anymore it's so easy.\n\nThe pleather ear-cups certainly feel strange if you're used to cloth padding, but IMO they are an improvement over the cloth. The pleather does get warm much more quickly than the cloth did, but the pleather never reaches the same max temp as the Arctis 1 did. It ends up being a nice compromise since they never get uncomfortably warm and force you to take them off to cool down like the cloth pads.\n\nThe ANC works fine AFAIK, I've never had ANC until now so I have no comparison. Though be warned if you use them while next to a running fan the ANC will make your ears pop like crazy when there's no audio playing. The sensation is shockingly intense under the right circumstances. That's not the headphone's fault though, that's just how human inner-ears work and the brain just freaks out when there's only negative pressure waves to hear. So if you have vertigo be careful, using ANC near lots of white noise like a fan has a strong chance of triggering a vertigo episode, IMO.\n\nThe sound clarity is noticeably better than most other headphones, but they aren't perfect. They reproduce mid-highs between around 800-20k hertz amazingly well, but they seem to struggle with technical bass frequencies like you would hear in a slap-bass jazz solo. The headphones certainly give it their all trying to reproduce low frequencies, but the drivers push themselves too hard trying and bottom out just a little. It isn't awful by any means, it just sounds like Gain Over-Peaking when a 100hertz note is trying to go PLANG; instead they make more like a PlopANG sound as the driver literally smacks the edge of it's max extension.\n\nRegardless of the relatively minor flaws I am very happy with the Nova Pros overall. 5/5 Stars, but if the rating scale went up to 100 then I would give these a ~93/100 rating.",
                "2": "Hi all (READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY),\n\nBelow is my one-week review with the product. I will edit it after a 3 month period.\n\nTo start, I have lots of experience with headphones. I have had Beats Studios, Airpods Max, Turtle Beachs, Bose 700s, multiple Razer headsets, and even other Steelseries products like the Arctis 6. None of these compare to these for a few reasons I will go into below. I use headphones for gaming but also I work from home as a software engineer, so I am on the computer a LOT and in lots of zoom meetings.\n\n!!! Disclaimer !!!: These are the \"Xbox\" version of these. That means, on your multi-system adapter/DAC, one cord can go into a PC/PlayStation and one can go into an Xbox. **If you plan to use this for a PC and PlayStation, please go buy the non-Xbox version. That said, if you plan to ever use this with an Xbox, you will need this version. You CAN use the Xbox slot for a PC, but it will show up as an \"Xbox Controller\" and will have more limited functionality.\n\nOkay, back to the reasons.\n1. Ease of use. I opened these up, plugged the multi-system DAC into my PC, turned on the headset and was ready to go. I had a few onboarding steps: Download Steelseries GG, update drivers, restart device (a few times?), but since then they have works FLAWLESSLY.\n\n2. Wireless. These aren't just your typical wireless. I have had no connection issues. I can walk to the other side of the house, as long as I don't have too many walls between me and my computer these things still work, even then there was just some static. The quality is great as well.\n\n3. Battery. This is HUGE. There is a battery in the headset that you can remove and swap with the one CHARGING IN THE DAC. Yes, you heard me, just swap the battery when you need and boom, full charge. You'll never need the direct connection outside of updates to the firmware. This really is fantastic and easy to use.\n\n4. Microphone. I don't personally use the microphone, but the quality compared to most other headset mics I have used it up there. Some have asked me if you can use the mic while it is in the headset still. I'd say yes, but it will be lower volume and less clear, but I tested it and it would still work (and frankly was still better than like HyperX headset microphones that I've had. I wouldn't buy these FOR the microphone per-say, if you want a nice microphone you can buy a Blue Snowball for cheap on amazon on sale and it'll be all you need unless you want more professional stuff (get the Blue Yeti after that maybe).\n\n5. Connection. I have only used the DAC connection which is really really good as I said in the wireless review. That said, I will be trying to Bluetooth to test that seamlessness they inspire there. I would LOVE if I could get phone notifications while also gaming or in work calls without interrupting those I'm talking to our my gaming experience too much (while of course also me still being alerted).\n\n6. Look. These look great. They look professional enough that I can wear them on work calls. I would maybe thing twice if it was a client meeting, but other than that, I'd feel comfortable in these all day.\n\n7. Comfort. This is only a one-week review, but I will say they are quite comfortable. The airpods max and arctis 6 are notable uncomfortable to me, the first being too heavy and the second putting too much pressure on parts of my head that I get a headache. That said, no problem with these so far. I like the ear cups actually, they're soft and feel premium (as they should for this price point). I know I've seen people complain online, but I've had no issues with these. If I do, you'll see an update right below here.\n\nOverall: Great connectivity and ease of use while looking nice enough for me to not be embarrassed because they're \"gaming\" all while being comfortable with good audio. This is a very high price point. If you really are a gamer and want a very intuitive product while avoiding crazy RGBs and your headsets looking too \"gaming\", and you can afford these, then absolutely.\n\nThat said, this is not just money you're spending on this headset but it's money you could put elsewhere. Audio is important, but you could get a perfectly good headset for less and still not miss out on the gaming experience. These are absolutely a 'premium' product and thus the price point might not really align perfectly. That said, these are my favorite headphones to-date and I am very happy with my purchase, so you might be too.\n\nPlease like this helpful if this was useful for you.\n\nThanks for listening to my TED Talk :)",
                "3": "I've been wanting to purchase the Steelseries Arctis Nova Wireless Pro headset for a very long time, but could never justify spending the $350 for something I didn't strictly need because my current headset was working fine. However, after months and months and months of debating, I finally went ahead and bought it.\n\nI don't regret it at all.\n\nYes, $350 is a lot of money and definitely more than I would just throw at a luxury good. However, I am very happy with my purchase. Where should I start?\n\n1) Sound quality is amazing. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but music is clear and the bass is deep. Game audio is superb and it sounds just like my wired headsets. No issues at all here.\n\n2) Microphone quality is very good, too. I've got not complaints from anyone.\n\n3) Comfort is not perfect but more than good enough. They're a little tighter than my Arctis 7, but I only run into some very mild discomfort after eight hours of continuous use. Since I use these as my office headset, comfort is very important to me.\n\n4) The swappable battery was the main selling point for me. I use this headset for work, and I often times forget to charge them. Since there's a swappable battery, I'm never in danger of running out of juice. If I'm low, then I switch to the other battery (that's charging in the hub) and I'm good to go.\n\n5) Since I work from home, I needed some way to swap between my work laptop and my home desktop. Previously, I was using a USB switch, which is fine but clunky. The integrated hub makes this so easy. It allows for two wired inputs: PC-PC/PS5 or PC-Xbox, depending on the version. Do note that if you're connecting two PCs, you cannot use the PC-Xbox, as the Xbox port will not work correctly.\n\n6) Perhaps the only downside is the Noise Cancellation feature. It works, but doesn't work as well as a dedicated Noise Cancellation device. Since this was not a critical feature for me, I don't mind, but please be aware that it's not the strongest part of the headset.\n\nAll in all, if you have $350, and you're looking for an amazing wireless headset with swappable batteries and multiple inputs, the Nova Pro Wireless is what you're looking for. I highly recommend and I don't regret my purchase at all.",
                "4": "I love so many things about this headset, but there are a few issues:\n\n1. Heavy Software that you HAVE to use; can't just load a driver. I hate software that self opens and advertises at me. I don't pay $300+ an item for that.\n2. The stock ear cups are HOT; I had to buy aftermarket cups to not overheat constantly.\n3. The cost, especially when I add in the cups.\n4. The top band is rubber which can be uncomfortable after a while.\n5. Multi-Device support is NOT mixed like Astro headsets. You can only hear 1 at a time (includes BT functionality as well).\n\nAs I write this review, I'm asking myself why I haven't returned these and ordered another set of A50s. There are really 2 answers: Superior sound, hot swappable batteries and Bluetooth. If it weren't for these features and the fact that my last A50s had such a short lifespan, I would have already switched back. The software really is junk imo. I even tried using the advanced features to clip my gameplay and all that and it all failed....miserably. Just made itself annoying is all...constantly with the User Level Access prompt.\n\nTo be fair, had I never experienced A50s, these would have been my favorite of all time. They are lightweight, have excellent sound reproduction, amazingly cool features (you can set both Wireless and Bluetooth to prioritize latency or distance. The range on these exceeds the A50s for sure. The hot swappable batteries means NO CABLES EVER which is why this headset still gets a solid 4 stars.\n\nIn closing, I'd say these are a great value if you can catch them on sale somehow, but not sure they are worth the list price.",
                "5": "I see the top review is by a guy named M. Webb.\nI'd like to address some of his points and how just a few seconds of reading the instructions would have addressed all but one concern he has because the optical port was removed.\n\nI have no issues with the GG software. There is a feature that will allow you to hear yourself with ANC on when you're using the mic. If you go to the break-out box, you can turn that off. Other than that, I don't see why he is recommending to stay away from it. You NEED it to update the firmware.\n\n1. \"you're restricted to only making changes to sound profiles, etc when you use the software\"\nHold the button down, it will go into the menus to adjust the sound profiles. It says so in the instruction manual. After updating the firmware I closed the app and have not opened it again. It's running in the background, and I have not used to adjust levels or anything. I do it all with the break-out box it came with.\n\n2. \"So they give you this charging box now that doesn't let you do anything other than adjust the volume and chatmix\"\nAgain, HOLD THE BUTTON DOWN for like 2 seconds and you can adjust everything from the break-out box just like the previous model.\nYou CAN change sound profiles.\nYou CAN adjust the chant mix\nYou CAN switch input/output modes\nRead the instructions.\n\n3. \"Smaller battery - the previous generation used 1000 mah - they reduced the size to 700 mah. Less capacity so now we have to charge more often / buy more batteries\"\nThis is just flat out WRONG. The batteries easily last twice as long as the previous model. The previous model had a much shorter battery life, I have no idea WTF he's even talking about, to be honest.\n\n4. They didn't get rid of digital output, but they did get rid of the optical output, that's his first valid point. But I don't know why you would need it anymore. You can link this with any device that has a USB with the included USB C cable. And yes, it's in surround, not stereo. Again, it seems like he just needs to read instructions, I have had 0 issues swapping devices without having to unplug/plug in any device. The headset outputs surround sound, check your settings.\n\n5. \" They decided to use the cheapest plastic design at this single point of failure resulting in headphones that deteriorate well within the warranty period unless you have a tiny head or treat them like they're made of glass.\"\nI have no idea what he's even talking about. These are some of the sturdiest headphones I've ever bought. They feel like a tank and are solid. I don't know where this \"single point of failure is.\" He doesn't explain or elaborate. I am looking all over my set and can't find what he's talking about. Everything is sturdy, there are made from metal and thick plastic, but it doesn't feel heavy to wear.\n\n6. \"ANC is shit quality. I Have 4 year old BOSE with ANC that work so much better at masking / eliminating drone noise.\"\nThe ANC is not the best you can get, but it works really well. Based on his previous complaints, I would guess he doesn't know how to turn the ANC on. I cannot hear my PC next to me, I cannot hear the AC running from where I'm sitting with the ANC turned on. Is the ANC as good as my Sony XM5s? Hell no, but those are the best in the industry. If you're getting these to wear everywhere and block sound, they are not the best, for that. But for just sitting at home playing games, again, it works really well.\n\nSo in conclusion, he has no idea what he's talking about. These are some of the best feeling and sounding gaming headsets I've ever bought. Wearing them kind of feels just like the Sony XM4/5s. So if you like how those fit and feel, you will like this headset. You can connect to 2 devices with this at once too using the breakout box and Bluetooth. So you can listen to a podcast/music on your phone and be connected to your PC/PS5 at the same time listening to both. So I would very much recommend this if you can afford it. They are a very good headset and a justifiable upgrade over the previous model.\n\nSome other things to address.\nI saw another complaint about that, Bluetooth not working. It works fine if you connect it correctly and don't walk away too far. But I can walk downstairs and still listen to my phone with this if the phone is upstairs connected with Bluetooth. I have not had any issues dropping the connection. Maybe it's a defect and he should exchange them? I don't know, I don't have that issue.\n\nAnother complaint was about having to use the software to adjust the chatmix. You CAN NOT use the software for that. If you try and adjust it with the software it tells you to use the box! See the included screenshot.",
                "6": "I paid a hefty price for these \"premium\" headphones and the issues I have with this would not even be worth buying if this was only $30. Also, I'm still encountering new issues to update my review on.\n\nGood:\n+Wireless headphones with great range\n\n+Double batteries and the station for these headphones has a charger for one while the other is in the headset.\n\n+Comfortable fit.\n\n+Lots of audio customization in the station alone that doesn't require extra software.\n\nHowever, no amount of customizing fixed all these problems:\n\n- First off, this is a recent issue I'm adding to this review. I've had these headphones for less than a year, and already one of the ear cushions is tearing apart. I don't think I've owned a headset before that degrades this quickly.\n\n-If you use the 2.4G connection, don't use the volume tuner on the station or on the headphones unless you want to hear an obnoxious popping noise soon after doing that. I've spent well over 3 hours looking up many guides and changing the audio settings on the station over and over and this issue never went away. And to top it off, you can't use an external app to change the volume manually because this headset locks the volume at max and ONLY lets you use the headset or station volume control. The only way to get around that is to use something like SteelSeries GG equalizer since the volume control works differently on there. That alone would have deterred me from buying these if I had known about this. But there's plenty more to say.\n\n-Bluetooth setting fixed the volume cackling issue but brought up a new one. Some devices had terrible audio regardless of station settings, ALL had background static while nothing was playing (and sometimes still while something was playing), and audio levels jumped by 5 instead of 1 when using the volume tuner on the headset. Once again, after hours of looking up guides and changing settings on the station did nothing to fix this.\n\n-Battery charging. Despite being able to swap batteries, it doesn't matter when they randomly decide to not charge for no reason. It happens every (and I do mean EVERY) time I take the battery from the headset out and put it in the charging slot. It won't charge at all. I have to keep messing with the cables and battery before it just decides to work. Both batteries can be affected by it. So, one of the most unique features for this headset, doesn't work correctly. (And I checked to make sure they were inserted to the charge slot correctly and that there weren't any obstructions).\n\n-The Equalizer settings on the stations are awful. The built in ones are bad and the custom settings are very bare bones. If you want to use an equalizer, you are better off downloading software.\n\n-Active Noise Cancelling option brings many issues that cheaper headphones don't have. The popping problems I mentioned earlier are even worse with this setting on. And setting the sidetone to high on the station settings also causes problems. So that's always fun to have extra stuff to try out only to have annoying problems that make them useless.\n\n-Using a wired connection fixes some of these issues, but manages to bring in it's own set of problems. First off, if you use a wired connection directly into the station connected to your pc, the volume gets locked at max and suddenly nothing will lower it. Not the headphones, not the station, not even manually trying to change it on your pc works, the volume level goes all the way to 100 and never moves from there. The only way to change volume is in whatever program you have that has it's own volume options. (So let's say, you are watching a YouTube video and you connect your headphones to your station with a wire. The volume is locked at the highest and the only way to change that is in the YouTube video itself since it has it's own volume slider you can adjust. Trying to use PC settings won't work). Connecting a wire directly to your PC doesn't have any problems, except a very glaring one. Since you aren't connected to the station, none of the settings from there will work on the headset. You can't have both a wired and wireless connection as a workaround. So in other words, the $300 you spent for all these cool features come with annoying issues. The only way to avoid them is to use a wired connection directly into your PC, and none of the bonuses that come with the station are available.\n\nIf you want wireless gaming headphones, get something else, these are just awful. If you want Bluetooth headphones, you can get much cheaper ones without possible audio problems for cheaper. If you want regular gaming headphones, you can get much better ones at a cheaper price without all the problems this thing has.",
                "7": "A little bit of context: I game at the same desk that I work at, and will often transition from my work day into gaming afterwords on my Series X. Before buying these, I used a pair of Arctis 9Xs to listen to music and take calls during the day, then transition to gaming in the evening. I listen to music or sports on my laptop while I practice, and thus really valued the Arctis 9X's ability to blend bluetooth audio from my laptop with gaming audio. However, the 9Xs came with a host of issues that started to drive me insane:\n\n* Connectivity issues were awful. My headphones would regularly disconnect even when sitting at the desk, and would occur consistently when getting up and moving around\n* Turning on the headphones would turn on the xbox every time, so when setting up for work I would need to regularly turn off my Xbox since the headphones had turned it on.\n* The battery life wasn't long enough to last throughout the work day plus a gaming session\n\nNow on to the new headphones: first off, they are ridiculously expensive. I really hope Steelseries finds a way to lower the price-point, especially since the sound isn't a huge upgrade over previous generations. That said, for me, they were worth it, because I use my headphones for everything and all of the issues above are resolved:\n\n* Connectivity issues are gone. I get a solid connection even when walking around my (small) house\n* Bluetooth is separate from xbox and can be powered up individually for non-gaming use\n* The infinity system makes all-day battery usage a non-issue\n\nMy only real criticism of these headphones is the audio quality, which isn't much better than the Artcis 9Xs. It is better, and the noise cancelling is a nice addition, but at the price point I was hoping for something on-par with the Bose QuietComfort series and it isn't there.\n\nOtherwise, this is a great set of headphones and I'm glad Steelseries validated my decision to believe in them. These headphones are a clear upgrade over the previous gen and they clearly heard and fixed a majority of the pain points.",
                "8": "This is a review I will be updating more or less yearly. I am probably the definition of a power user for these headphones because I wear the entire day while I work and game, so like 10+ hours of daily wear for years on end. I dual pair and pick up work and family calls. I walk around the house doing chores while on meetings so range is important, everything is being used here.\n\nMy previous pair fell apart after 3 years, what was the culprit? The plastic, the plastic arm that holds the cups literally started giving out, flexing and cracking, letting the headband slip out. These headphones still use plastic in those areas, so we'll see.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nComfort: Excellent. I have a big ole head and the comfort on the novas is far superior. I can't describe it, the headband on the other ones would make my glasses leave marks behind my ears, real acquired taste, maybe a little masochism. These don't do that. The earpads are super soft and nice, I honestly like them more than the wear earwax trap aero weave or whatever the last ones had.\n\nSound: Seriously better. The novas along with the sonar software sound a lot brighter and clear. Apparently these near ear pads do some good work on the lowend, doesn't seem to be lacking. Certainly a step up. The previous version you could feel it maxing out and muddying up pretty badly, specially on the crucial low end parts. They could get a little fatiguing and the EQ feature was a little bizarre and harsh. Not horrible but I wouldn't put them anywhere on a top tier list.\n\nUser Experience: Same buttons on the side but they are now in this like, recessed area so you have to fiddle around to find them and any rubbing against the plastic translates to loud a** noise in your ears because of the seal the earpads have, it's meh, minor detail in the grand scheme of things but my hand is on those buttons all day, flipping to bluetooth, chatmix, volume, muting. Steelseries please make them like immediately obvious and protruding again please.\n\nMicrophone: Fantastic, a lot more sensitive to distance from the mouth than the previous version. I put it a bit too close and I was clipping like a mad man. Easy to get used to, love the fact that it can be EQd in sonar. Better than previous version I think, we'll see.\n\nBuild: They feel robust, similar headband deal going on, more subtle with only a couple of adjustment points.\n\nBattery life: I could be biased given my previous set had a lot of use but I did buy many new sets of batteries. The novas seem to be able to about twice as far as the pro wireless battery wise.\n\nI still think these headphones are the best pound for pound out there when it comes to all around feature set and quality. There's nothing that comes close. Steelseries contact me if you need feedback from someone that wears these 12 hours a day.",
                "9": "I decided to shell out for a higher end headset, instead of my typical $100-$200 Logitech or Razer headsets, and I am not disappointed at all.\n\nSOUND QUALITY: Good sound, the quality is fantastic, and directional sound is spot on. Playing WWZ with my friends they're usually calling out a special but don't know where it is, and I can pinpoint it almost immediately just from the directional sound. Makes for much more immersive experience for gamers, and music/movies are spectacular as well, and the quality doesn't diminish with volume (for those movies that go from \"what did he say?\" to my face looks like it has a leaf blower aimed at it).\n\nTHE MIC/SOUND CANCELLING: The mic actually picks my voice up, it helps when it's 2 inches or less from my mouth, but even farther than that, people can still hear me. As for sound cancelling, in a word: spectacular. This is the first headset I have owned that when it turns off, my brain immediately goes \"What just came on in the house?\" from the increase in noise, before I realize that's just the ambient hum of my computer, the A/C, fridge, water heater, and everything else in a house that makes very subtle noise. But it isn't disorienting nor does it muffle voices, I can still hear my girlfriend trying to sneak up on me, or if she calls me from another room clear as day.\n\nRANGE: It has decent range, I can go most anywhere in my house and it doesn't have an issue except the kitchen, I have to have the left side facing the computer room from the kitchen, but I blame that on all the metal appliances in that room interfering with the signal. Surprisingly, the microwave running right next to me does not affect it, which means the electronics inside are well shielded.\n\nCOMFORT: I have noticed the band that rests on top of my head is very slowly stretching, but it has several notches to adjust it tighter as it does, not a big issue for me. The ear pads are great, never really get that ache or sweat from pressure or lack of air.\n\nBATTERY: Usually lasts multiple days between charges while being used 2-6 hours a day. I actually like the fact that the battery is removable, it prevents the need for a cord to be attached to the headset if you forgot to charge it the night before. But if you like to charge it overnight, you can plug the headset in to charge the battery, or swap it into the HUD module and charge it. And it's quick to swap the battery, takes me about 10 seconds in total; most of the time I can do it without my friends even noticing I'm gone during a conversation.\n\nOTHER FEATURES: The HUD module can have two computers plugged into the USB C inputs and you can actively switch between the two which I personally found very useful. You can even plug in via 3.5mm jack directly to the headset or to the HUD module; I don't use this, but it's a nice option to have. It's nice to have a reference of sound and headset details (battery level, input, volume) for quick troubleshooting such as if everything suddenly goes silent, I can look at the HUD and see if it's receiving sound or not and that will determine whether it's a headset issue or a computer issue. These are all frivolous additions, but can tip a decision one way or another if your teetering between headsets.\n\nAnd if you've read everything up this point, you're actually researching headsets and want to make an informed decision, which I hope this helps in that endeavor. For reference I have a slightly smaller than average head coming in at a 7.25 cap size (22 5/8\" circumference), my ears do stick out a good amount (if you're worried about the depth of the ear pieces) and they barely touch the fabric covering the speakers if at all. If you have the dough, I think this headset or their newer versions are worth the investment.",
                "10": "I've been using the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Gaming Headset since October 1, 2022, and it's been an absolute game-changer in my gaming experience. This headset has not only met but exceeded my expectations in every aspect.\n\nThe sound quality is phenomenal. The premium Hi-Fi drivers deliver crisp, clear audio that brings games to life. Whether I'm immersed in an intense FPS battle or exploring vast open-world landscapes, the soundstage is rich and detailed, making the experience incredibly immersive.\n\nActive Noise Cancellation is a feature I didn't know I needed until I had it. It effectively blocks out external noise, allowing me to focus entirely on my game without distractions. This feature has been particularly useful during competitive gaming sessions where concentration is key.\n\nThe Infinity Power System is ingenious, ensuring I'm never without power. Being able to swap out batteries while the other charges is a huge convenience, eliminating the need for wired play when the battery runs low. This continuous wireless experience is something I greatly appreciate.\n\nThe comfort of the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is unparalleled. I've had marathon gaming sessions, and not once have I felt discomfort or the need to take a break due to the headset. The fit is perfect, with just the right amount of clamp force, and the ear cushions are soft and breathable.\n\nThe Stealth Retractable Mic is another standout feature. It's crystal clear, ensuring my teammates can hear me without any issues, and I love how it seamlessly retracts into the headset for a sleek look when not in use.\n\nCompatibility with multiple systems (PC, PS5/PS4, Switch, Mobile) has been a boon. I frequently switch between devices, and this headset has handled each transition flawlessly. The versatility and ease of connection across platforms have been impressive.\n\nDurability-wise, the headset still feels as sturdy and premium as the day I got it. Despite daily use, there are no signs of wear and tear, which speaks volumes about its build quality.\n\nIn summary, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Multi-System Gaming Headset has been outstanding in every way. From sound quality to comfort, from battery life to build quality, it ticks all the boxes. I highly recommend it to any gamer looking for a top-tier wireless headset. It's a worthwhile investment for a premium gaming experience."

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "In the midst of so many Wii U games getting a re-release on the Switch I knew it would only be a matter of time before Super Mario 3D World received that re-release. Like many Wii U titles, this one was a gem overlooked due to the Wii U's low sales. Also like many Wii U exclusives, it means that so many missed out on it the first time. What makes Super Mario 3D World so special is that it's simply among the best Mario experiences you could have. It takes the best of Mario's 2D adventures and combined it with (then) the best of Mario's 3D adventures. It was the ultimate time capsule of everything that made Mario great, and so many people missed out on it. It is still a quint essential experience for Mario fans simply because of the time capsule it is, and remains even as Super Mario Odyssey has hit the scene.\n\nMario games are never a plot driven affair. Normally they all involve Peach getting kidnapped and Mario going to save her. This one is different. In this one, however, Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Peach find a magic pipe that looks to be in disrepair. Mario and Luigi fix it... only for a Sprixie to emerge and explain to Mario and company that Bowser has come and imprisoned much of their population. She only speaks briefly before Bowser comes from the pipe, traps her in a jar and disappears. Fearing the worst, Mario and company hop into the pipe to go to this new world.\n\nThe plot setup, if you couldn't tell, is largely ripped from the US version of Super Mario Bros. 2, only this time it isn't a dream. Also like Super Mario Bros. 2, you can choose between the four heroes: Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Peach. Each one has the abilities that made them worthwhile in that first outing way back in 1988. Mario is perfectly balanced, Luigi jumps the highest, Toad is the fastest and Peach can briefly hover in the air. There aren't a ton of reasons to use one character over another, however. Most of the stages are designed to be traversed in a similar manner.\n\nThe game mixes the best of 2D and 3D Mario adventures. The game has a level by level design and a world map like 2D Mario games, but the over map acts as a hub similar to 3D Mario games. This means that instead of Mario following a pre-determined path you're actually free to explore the map without going on a track like in previous adventures. Sometimes you want to do this. The worldmaps sometimes contain Toad houses for items, 1UP Mushrooms, coins or even divergent paths to certain bonuses. Each time you complete a level you unlock new levels, sometimes multiple levels, and you don't have to complete every single stage to get to Bowser. There are even warp pipes (though not very many).\n\nEach stage centers around a concept. You're always introduced to this concept in a safe environment before it ramps it up. What makes this intersting for Super Mario 3D World is that it manages to make every level feel unique, experimental and fresh. Even if a concept gets repeated, there's an intersting twist on it that completely changes how you interact with it. You can get a small idea of what the concept is before jumping in. The stages themselves are usually fairly straight forward, but there are certain things to keep in mind as you go. The main goal of every level is to make it to the flag pole, but every level also contains green stars. Collecting these is important. As the game progresses you'll need them to unlock levels the further you get. Luckily there are green stars found in other places too such as mystery box stages, or doing the Captain Toad Treasure Tracker mini game. There are also stamps to collect in each stage, though this doesn't add much. It's just a collectible.\n\nMario and company also have the ability to use various different suits and powerups. In most 3D Mario games, Mario's powerups are temporary, but here it takes a page primarily from Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World where the powerups are permanent until you get hit, and where you can store one to swap out at any time. There are familiar power ups. The majority of which you've seen before. The fire flower is a staple. The game also gives you the boomerang suit once again from Super Mario 3D Land, the Tanooki Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3 returns, and so does the Mega Mushroom from New Super Mario Bros. The big introduction here, however, is the cat suit. With it you can use a forward attack to hit any enemies in your way, do a front dive, and climb up walls. This is especially useful as you can also climb the flagpole at the end of a level for a free 1UP with the catsuit equipped. There are also temporary powerups that can't be taken out of a level, but are useful when you find them. There's an ice skate in some ice levels that you can ride around it, propeller boxes to hover, and also mobile cannons you can carry around.\n\nIn addition, Mario has access to a lot of moves he normally only has in 3D games. Mario can long jump, backflip, side jump, and wall jump. This allows for more flexibility within the level design, and sometimes this encourages you to explore in the levels themselves.\n\nSuper Mario 3D World doesn't provide a huge challenge. Instead the engagement is based on the game's rather intersting level designs and tight platforming. If there is one game which demonstrates the absurdity of a life count in this day and age it is most certainly the Mario series (which, thankfully, Odyssey did away with). Super Mario 3D is going to shower you with 1UPs. Even if you falter, it's not unusual to find enough coins, hidden 1UPs or reach the top of a flagpole. Even more than that, if you fail at a stage more than 5 times, the game offers you a Super Leaf that will make you invincible to enemies to get through it. This is purely optional, but the point is that Super Mario 3D World isn't really out to punish you for screw ups.\n\nWhat CAN make the game unusually challenging, however, is multiplayer. Much like New Super Mario Bros. Wii, 3D World supports up to 4 players simultaneously. This can make some courses easier, but more often than not multiplayer is a hazardous experience that will be prone to ending friendships. In the first place, the camera only really centers on player one. More importantly it's easier to do such things as pick up friends and throw them into pits, jump on them and screw them up, or just get in each others way. This doesn't multiplayer can't be fun, it just means that if you're goal is progress through a stage you may find that this is a much bigger challenge when some courses require everyone to be on the same page. You can also play multiplayer online, but this has had mixed results (at least for me) and is even worse simply because a precise platformer like Super Mario 3D World... was simply not made for lag, should you encounter it. Stick with local multiplayer here if you're looking to play with friends.\n\nThere are a few noticeable differences from the Wii U version. The most eye-popping is that the game simply has a cleaner look and is playing at a much higher resolution. In fact, the game overall runs much faster. Characters move through levels faster, and everything flows much better. This is going to make you think that levels are short, but really it's just that progress through them is much quicker than you remember. You no longer have access to the Miiverse, which is no big loss. But the biggest addition here is \"Bowser's Fury,\" which is a new game in which you get to explore an island collecting Cat Shines. Every now and then Bowser will surface, you'll have to hide from him as he wrecks havoc, and then you'll resume. Once you've found enough in any given area you can become Giga Mario in cat form and battle Bowser. At first this seems fun, but the reality is that it gets old really fast. It looks beautiful, it flows seamlessly, but after a couple of hours of it, you're just going to go back to 3D World.\n\nIf there were any downsides to Super Mario 3D World it would primarily be that some aspects of Mario games are not quite as charming as they once were. I mentioned the life system feels obsolete in a game that is so quick to dole out so many lives. The timer also doesn't feel necessary anymore. The only time you'll feel like time is of the essence is if you get stuck trying to find one last green star, only to have to start a level over again because of time. But the timer simply isn't that big a deal, or that constricting. It just doesn't really have a reason to be here other than because 2D Mario games once used it. Neither of these things is really detracting from the game, but it's hard not to notice them.\n\nAll of that said, it's hard not to admire the creativity put into the game's levels and design. Super Mario 3D World remains one of Mario's best outings. It takes the best of 2D Mario games and combines them with the best of the 3D games. It allows for Super Mario 3D World to represent the best of what the Mario series has offered us over time. Given that Mario's next major outing to follow 3D World originally was Super Mario Odyssey, it felt like a love letter back in the days of the Wii U before Mario would evolve once again. Today, it serves as a reminder of where Mario has been as we remember the legacy he has created. It is a worthwhile game to play and delightful for Mario fans. Especially those who enjoyed the games that Super Mario 3D World opts to pay tribute to.",
                "2": "I got this game as a treat for myself for my birthday. Having never played the original Super Mario 3D World on the Wii U, this is a must buy if you're a Mario fan.\nIt's only been a few days, but I've had tons of fun with the game already. It's perfect to pick up and play with some friends, family, or some roommates! Personally, it's a great game for me to chill out. The whole campaign is fun, and a bit of a visual upgrade from the WiiU. The new mode is very fun, and beautiful to look at!",
                "3": "This is my review after playing this game for almost 2 months.\nI never owned a WiiU system, so this game was perfect for me. The main plot is about bowser kidnapping the sprixie fairies, and in this game you can play as peach now that she isn’t kidnapped. (You can also play as rosalina after beating world star-2, peach and rosalina are perfect for little sisters, Princess lovers, etc) You can play as Mario, Luigi, Toad, Peach, and Rosalina. All have their ups and downs.\nMario- most balanced of them all, not much to say\nLuigi- jumps higher but slides a little\nToad- runs fast, but is small and can’t jump very high\nPeach- can float, but doesn’t run that fast\nRosalina- honestly the most op character, can’t think of a bad thing about her but she’s like Mario but with the spin move from super Mario galaxy.\n\nThe multiplayer gets criticized for being, “too chaotic”, but in my opinion, it’s the most fun I’ve had for a while.\nThe game has 11 worlds In total.\nWorld 1- the easiest world, very grass themed and made to introduce new players, not the best to replay\nWorld 2- desert themed, a little bit harder than world 1\nWorld 3- Ice themed, has lots of fun, creative levels (such as the super Mario kart snes themed level)\nWorld 4- Also desert, very challenging\nWorld 5- also ice, world 5 has some fun levels such as the golden express\nWorld 6- cloud themed, the best world in the game in my opinion, lots of creative levels\nWorld Castle (7)- lava themed, {spoiler alert} not the final world in the game, but a very fun one and very replayable\nWorld Bowser (8)- carnival themed, this world is bad*ss. The big bowser animatronic, the music, and that’s just the hub world. This is home to some very challenging levels too.\nWorld star- space themed, very fun levels and awesome new unlockable character.\nWorld mushroom- harder remixes of other levels, very fun and hard\nWorld flower- like world mushroom, but with different levels and more harder\nWorld crown- the hardest levels in the game, such as champions road\n\nAnd that’s just the worlds. There are also the power ups.\nMushroom- gives you a boost in life, turns small Mario into big Mario\nFire flower- throws fireballs\nStar- invincible for about 5 seconds\nSuper bell- turns you into cat Mario, you can pounce and scratch and climb and dive.\nTanooki leaf- turns you into tanooki Mario, you can float and stuff\nBoomerang- you can shoot boomerangs\nThere are more, but those are the main ones.\nSuper Mario 3D world is fun. But we haven’t talked about bowsers fury, the new content.\n\nIn bowsers fury you go around lake lapcat collecting cat shines. Collect enough to get the giga bell to fight fury bowser. Bowser jr also helps you because he wants his dad back to normal. The lake lapcat is full of cat trees, enemies, and even pigeons. Every thing is cat themed.\nThis game is fairly short and I 100%ed it In a month (I could have 100%ed it faster, but I was also playing 3D world)\n\nOverall this whole game is worth $60.\nBut only if you don’t have 3D world. This game is not worth the $60 price if you also have 3D world. Bowsers fury is NOT worth $60. If They released it separately, it would be about $20. This game is mainly for players you haven’t experienced the original 3D world yet. 3D world is the game I usually play, bowsers fury is a fun side, but again, it’s not worth a whole $60.\nOther than that, awesome game. 9.5/10 and a big 5 star rating.",

We were all very excited to give this one a try. We've been having a lot of fun playing this game. This game has is a really good quality game and it's a lot of fun. My daughters have especially loved playing it. They play this when they have friends over as well. It's an entertaining game for all of us. We really love it!",
                "7": "Hard to believe that this past year, we celebrated the 35th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers. While it had not been as strong as many gamers had expected, we still got a lot of great toys and games featuring Nintendo's proud mascot. We got the Super Mario 3D All-Stars package, which had Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Sunshine & Super Mario 64. But other Mario titles flowed to the Switch as well like Paper Mario: The Origami King. Still, when you look at games from the Wii U, you had almost all of the Mario games go to Switch already, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and New Super Mario Brothers U Deluxe. But one game that has not made it to Switch until now is Super Mario 3D World. The game was well-received for Wii U owners, but not as strongly sold, due to the lackluster sales of Wii U. Still, Nintendo pressed on and decided to release it for the Switch. Sadly, the game was suppose to be released last year, but got held back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it is here, with a added bonus.\n\nSuper Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, is a 2-in-1 purr-fectly conjured compilation where Super Mario 3D World is remastered and includes new features made for Switch, and the new mini-adventure Bowser's Fury which takes a unique twist on the Mario formula. First for Super Mario 3D World, the game looks great and brings in all the wonderfully made platforming from the Wii U game, with some small tweaks to make it work a bit better. In the game, Mario & his friends need to rescue Pixie Princesses that Bowser and his minions have captured. Along the way, Mario, Peach, Toad & Luigi each all maneuver with new and returning features like the thrilling Cat Suit, which allows Mario & friends to maneuver in new and challenging ways. You can now climb up walls, attack like a feline and skid through pathways that are more challenging than ever. You also have courses that are new for Switch owners to hover through like Red-Hot Run, The Great Goal Pole, and the towering Champion's Road which will get you screaming for more.\n\nYou also have a new game here: Bowser's Fury, where Mario must team-up with Bowser Jr. in a epic quest to save Bowser from a uncontrollable raging toxin where got into and becomes Fury Bowser (a towering Ganon-like creature) bent on mayhem to destroy Lake Lapcat. In this game, Mario must partner with Bowser Jr. on the quest to save Bowser from the raging being he has became. The game plays more like a Super Mario Odyssey adventure with Mario 3D World twists, packed-down into 1 major overworld. In the game, Mario and Bowser fight cat-themed foes like Boom Boom, Bullies and unlock puzzles and collect items and find the guarded cat shines to unlock bells that will help Mario & Bowser Jr. stop the unraveled Fury Bowser. The game itself is fun, but does feel interesting as a concept to make a condensed Super Mario 64-esque game. It works well, and the game looks amazing with the designs and platforming. In itself, the campaign may be short, but will take your fiery breath away when you play it. I think it looks charming and puts in a new wrinkle on the Mario 3D platforming formula that worked so well from past games like Super Mario Galaxy 2.\n\nThere are a lot of things that work well with both of these games, with a few faults though. First of all, for Bowser's Fury, for skilled gamers of past Mario platformers, they may find the game shorter than other Mario titles, because of the main overworld. Some gamers would've wanted more overworld packed into the hub-world like earlier Mario titles, but it is actually interesting to put Mario into a Luigi's Mansion kind of setting. Also, you would also have to toggle with many different power-ups at once while battling Fury Bowser in the game that you may need that as a lifeline without losing lives. It may be shocking but sadly it is what it takes at times while controlling Mario & Bowser Jr. while mastering Bowser's Fury. While it may be repetitive, it still is a lot of fun playing. As for Super Mario 3D World, the main disadvantage is only if you have mastered the Mario adventure before from the Wii U era, you may not feel entertained with this game all over again. But nevertheless, considered that so many people never played the Wii U title, considered it was one of the weakest-selling game system from the Nintendo legacy, it still is worth playing at the end.\n\nWhen you look at Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, it is a mixed bag for some fans of the Super Mario Brothers legacy. But nevertheless, it is a absolutely fun title worth checking out. You get two adventures of the furry-kind into one package that does work. While many people may feel Super Mario 3D World is not a strong buy, it is a strong buy because it is 2 adventures into one nearly purr-fect pair of escapades. As for Bowser's Fury, I did get what I wanted out of it, and would still want to intrigued with more when I missed on it. Still for what it is worth, pairing the 2 games in one compilation is worth the money. If they were sold apart, it would not be worth purchasing. Still, I absolutely recommend buying this game pack a lot. It can come across as a great pair of actual purr-fect strangers.\n\nGraphics: A-\n\nSound: B+\n\nControl: B+\n\nFun & Enjoyment: Super Mario 3D World: A- for Solo: B+ for Multiplayer Bowser's Fury: B For Solo & Multiplayer\n\nOverall: B+",
                "8": "I really liked Mario 3D World when it launched on Wii U several years ago and was eager to play it again. This is a great upgrade with a huge expansion and good quality-of-life tweaks.\n\nThe core game is one of my favorite Mario platformers: it has classic and new Mario powerups in an easy-to-follow 3D setting. It really feels like classic SNES Mario World but with a little extra depth. Unlike the \"New Super Mario Bros\" sidescrolling games, this one gives you enough space to play with 4 people and not get in each others' way. You can work together or engage in some battletoads-style friendly sabotage. It's got lots of variety and lots of levels. If you liked the realistic open worlds of Mario Odyssey or Galaxy this might feel too simple, but if you like the old-school style of Mario 3 or NSMB, this really captures that.\n\nThis Switch re-make has identical visuals and all the original content with a few perks- the movement is overall faster and controls better than it did before, making the whole game feel a little smoother and snappier.\n\nBut the \"Bowser's Fury\" expansion is a huge value-add. It is accessible from the start menu but is essentially a whole extra open-world with a lot of new ideas. It's much more open and challenging with a great 2P co-op mode and a fun kaiju-monster-battle element as you try to evade godzilla-sized bowser until you can power up to his level and have giant-size boss fights. It's not as long as the main game but it kept me going for several days to get all the shines. It really feels like a return to Mario 64, but with more powerups and smooth controls and camera. Hugely recommended.",

                "1": "***Update: I had originally given these 3 stars per below, but after more time I've updated it to 5... The battery life and wireless range is phenomenal, both are so much better than my previous Corsairs! I was charging those daily, after only about 4-5 hours I'd get low battery warnings, but I almost never have to charge these, it's insane how long they last... and the range is almost twice what I got from the Corsairs, I can roam all over and never lose sound! So just be sure to tweak the sound a bit as I noted before, and maybe about $15 of the price is simply for the brand name, but I'm liking these more and more with time!\n\nInitial Review:\n\nOk, I'm really torn on these... First things first: myself, along with many others, think the sound quality is horrible out of the box! People that say they sound great I don't think have experience with more expensive headphones and are probably moving up from $30 cheapos...\n\nFirst thing: After scouring Reddit and some trial and error, turn off all the special sound settings (like DTS and advanced settings) and move the bass to +7 and the treble to +4. After I made this change, the quality was much much better!\n\nI previously had Corsair HS70s for two years and HS80s for two years, but I hate the iCue software Corsair uses, it's a ridiculous resource hog and constantly has issues. So for me this is actually a mild downgrade price-wise as you read my pros and cons, they're primarily vs my Corsairs:\n\nPros: Incredibly lightweight and very comfortable. Battery lasts absolutely forever (I had to charge my Corsairs daily; the Logitech can go for days!). Sound is adequate once tweaked. Volume tops off at a low level but as a 45-year-old who is a huge music fan I can tell my ears aren't what they once were, so they're doing this for your protection. Software is \"light-weight\" and unobtrusive.\n\nCons: If you're mainly listening to music, spend a bit more on Corsair or Steelseries or even a purely audiophile set. You'll be disappointed with these. They're lightweight but as a downer feel a bit flimsy. As I said, sound is terrible out of the box imo.\n\nI really struggled with the number of stars to give! For the money, if you know you're getting a lightweight pair of headphones with great battery and no hassle, they're not bad at all. If you want more quality to your sound, go elsewhere however. A little bit more money can get you a way better sound.\n\nAs for Logitech in general, I was tired of having three different programs (keyboard, mouse, headphones) so also got a Logitech mouse after remembering one I loved years back. The brand does feel overpriced for the quality they provide, as a general rule, as if they're capitalizing off their brand. I'm ok with both these and the mouse, they're fine, but for just $20-40 more each I'd say try one of the newer brands if you haven't before. The Logitech stuff just feels cheaper overall than the price would suggest but they get the job done!",
                "2": "I wanted something with a little range so I could putter about my home without the crackle and pop of a faltering signal. I've been burned before on a pair of Logitech G533's that absolutely would not hold a charge nor connect wirelessly, so figured I'd take a chance on a different model.\n\nI've not had them for long at all, in fact I've only had them for the one day, and will update my review if needed, but I immediately charged them and put them through a 10-hour run and so far I'm impressed. These were plug and play, worked and connected instantly, and I can listen to PC audio through these anywhere in my home. Granted it's a smaller place, so not much of an ask, but I'm just so glad I can listen to whatever or voice chat using the optional mic (though at my desk I use a Blue Yeti mic) while putting food together or slapping art materials together in another room.\n\nThese look great with the white/aluminum corsair mechanical LED keyboard I recently acquired as well. Love that clean-and-colorful look! Will probably match all my peripherals to it whenever they need replacing.\n\nThese are not strictly noise canceling but they actually do a good job of muffling the background noise anyway, which helps in concentrating on what I'm listening to. Not bad for something that doesn't clamp onto your skull with a vice grip! Pretty lightweight and comfortable so far, and the audio quality is pretty solid. Not astounding, but not poor by any means. Good for both voice chat and gaming, and not bad for music. For what its worth I'm probably not the best judge of that as I'm lacking a bit in sensitivity to lower tones/voices in one ear, so my hearing is always just a smidge off no matter what I listen through. Your mileage may vary.",
                "3": "I love these headphones. They were easy to setup with my PC. I LOVE that they are wireless. I hate having cords all over my gaming setup so being able to charge the headphones and rock them for about a week without needing to charge them is great. My previously Logitech headphones weren’t wireless and the cord would always get trapped under my chair. Now I don’t have to worry about it. The headphones also feel great. I wear glasses and sometimes headsets don’t fit comfortably with my glasses and the glasses arms would press against the back of my ears and hurt them, but I’ve worn these headphones for 8 hours straight and haven’t had any issues. They’re also really good and canceling our noise. My boyfriend and I play video games in the same room and when I wear my headphones it’s difficult to hear him talking in the room when he is several feet away from me. The headphones do a good job So far they’re definitely worth the price. Plus they look so cute with the lights on the sides.",
                "4": "It's honestly unbelievable to me that I'm having such a hard time finding a headset with sound as good as my cheap 6-year-old $15 Sades headset that recently needed replacing, let alone better. It was uncomfortable, so I wouldn't buy another from that brand, but the sound was, I am realizing in retrospect as I try out more expensive headsets, unexpectedly great.\n\nAnyway, let's talk about this headset. I kind of love it. I wish I loved it more. It's good; it's just not perfect.\n\nCOMFORT: I'm a woman with a fairly average-sized head (hat size 7 1/8), and it's hard to find headsets that weren't only designed with large men's heads in mind. The elastic strap across the top of these makes the headset lighter and more comfortable to wear, and I really like it. The strap has two notches on each side, so you can adjust a bit for the size of your head. The strap being separate from the solid headband also helps you remove, adjust, or hang up the headset without directly touching your head or the strap, which is nice. The earcups are plush and cloth-covered, which is comfortable and doesn't get as hot as pleather cups normally do, and doesn't squeeze your head as much as those do while wearing glasses.\n\nHowever, the headset is still somewhat bulky, especially the large earcups, and while these are quite comfortable overall, it would have been even better for me if they were a little smaller and lighter. If you have a larger head, this will likely not be an issue for you.\n\nLOOKS/BUILD: These look nice (I got the white version), less boring and bulky than most gaming headsets on the market. The design is sleek and stylish, and the headset seems sturdy and well-made.\n\nHEADPHONE SOUND: It's ok. It's nothing amazing, and I would want to use something better for listening to music for fun, but it's not bad. The directional audio works ok for games.\n\nSOFTWARE: The Logitech G software is pretty good. It shows the battery percentage of the headset and allows you to adjust the lighting and various sound settings. But more on that when I get to the mic.\n\nLIGHTS: The RGB strips are a nice feature and they look good, but it seemed like I was hearing a slight buzz in the right ear when the lights were on, so I keep them turned off. Interestingly, if you go out of wireless range, the lights will go back on, so it works as an indicator for me.\n\nWIRELESS: The quality of the wireless is the biggest reason I love this headset. It works well and has a large, reliable range: I can walk most of the way across my apartment before it cuts out, which is important because I often have to chase after a naughty cat while in the middle of something, and I can keep up a conversation while I do.\n\n\"DISCORD INTEGRATION\": I still don't know what this is supposed to mean, but Discord does recognize the headset well, and I've never had it randomly disconnect inputs or have any other problems like I've had with other headsets. This headset has been very solid for me in that sense: you plug in the dongle and it just works.\n\nBATTERY LIFE: The battery life is very good. You can also still use the headset while it's charging, and it charges fast. The cable is just a normal USB-C to USB-A cable, so you can plug it in anywhere convenient. I'm regularly in calls all day without needing to charge the headset, so I normally plug it in overnight every day or two.\n\nMIC: Here's the problem, and the reason I'm rating this four stars. The mic isn't good. It's just not. It's functional, and if you're using this is in some way in which you'll never have to hear your own voice-- gaming, video calls-- it's good enough. But it's not good enough for streaming or recording. The Logitech software allows you to adjust all sorts of settings and even download settings other people put together, and it helps, but it doesn't make the mic good. I was hoping this could be all I'd need for now as my current setup is too noisy for a standalone mic, but I might have to look into getting a ModMic to stream with this. The mic itself doesn't flip up, but it's bendable and detachable, so you can remove it if you want to use a different mic.\n\nOVERALL: I wish the mic were better, and it would be great if the headphone sound were a bit more impressive too, but for the price, it's a very good headset overall for general use. If you need more professional sound, this is not that. There are no serious problems that I've encountered with the headset, though-- it's solid and reliable; it's just that the worst aspects of it are only ok and not great.",
                "5": "Let me start with the negative:\n\nThe only adjustment to the headband is to switch how it is attached to the headphones. Headband is elastic, so will likely stretch over time. Also, Logitech does not sell the earpads. Just the headstraps. I bought the white version, so I could swap out the straps and earpads to change colors. Wish Logitech made other colors for the other earpads and sold the earpads, because it would be cool to personalize them even more. Would sure love some teal earpads. Also, on the PS4, I have to adjust the mic every time I plug in the device. On the computer, the mic was set so low by default, it was difficult to hear the voice. Had to go into the Windows settings to adjust, using the old control panel option. PITA. Once turned up, it sounds fantastic. Finally, we cannot figure out how to turn off the lights when on the PS4. Using the app on Windows will let you do so when you are using the headset.\n\nSo why am I giving the headphones 5 stars with those negatives?\n\nThe incoming audio is fantastic. We are audiophiles here. Very good sound quality in the Logitech G733 headsets. My husband, a musician, loves the sound quality. He is very picky. Even bought his own pair of G733s, after trying mine. He is using it for work too.\n\nThe mic is also outstanding. Crisp, clear audio from both my female alto voice and his baritone gruff voice. He has used mine on MS Team meetings (windows 10) for work, and when we play cooperatively on PS4 video games, on PS Plus, using different PS4s.\n\nEven though the headset was a tad tight at first, and there are limited settings, both of us love the comfort. I prefer the other earpads to the Logitech ones. They are softer. But the Logitech ones feel like memory foam. Will likely last longer than the cheap purple ones I bought.\n\nI also bought the wireless Hyper X Cloud II headset, before buying these. The G733s were second on my list. The sound quality of the Cloud II is equal to the Logitech G733. The mic quality is not as clear in the Cloud II. The comfort in the Cloud II is just a smidgen better. It has more adjustments too.\n\nCannot rate them on PC gaming latency though. I do not play PC games. There is a little delay on the PS4 online gaming, however, one cannot necessarily blame the headset. Sony is not known to have the fastest servers.\n\nHope this helps you make an educated decision. I love these, from a style, fit, comfort and audio/mic quality perspective.",
                "6": "For the price these are probably one of the most solid products I've ever purchased. I'm the kind of guy who never says/thinks that kind of thing (I'm very picky when it comes to spending money) or even writes reviews, so take that into consideration when reading this. I bought these in Oct. '21 and they've MORE than lasted since then. I have replaced the bungee head strap, but I'm a freakishly tall guy with a commensurately big head so I'm not surprised I stretched it out. That's probably the only piece that I'll need to replace regularly ($15 every 6 months, I can live with that). The cups just got a little gunky after a few months and were also replaced but after cleaning the originals I now have a set of two that can be swapped out any time. The rest of the build quality is excellent. I remove the mic \"stump\" multiple times every day (usually if I'm eating or something) and it's never given me any issues at all. This piece can also be swapped out, but are a bit more expensive than the other items. I guess you could probably just plug any old 3.5mm jacked mic into the headset and just use it that way, I can't imagine you'd lose any features but you may.\n\nThe sound quality is really not bad at all. Not amazing or outside of the expectation of a product like this, but it's quite good. I do find myself often using these instead of other options when walking around the house. They're a bit bulky, but I'm not putting them on for the sake of my image. The noise cancellation is meh to serviceable, I can still easily hear my dog barking out the front window downstairs when all the kids get out of school and are walking by to get home.\n\nThe range is decent, I'd say it's about a 50 foot bubble from the transmitter. It goes through drywall decently enough, but not so easily through brick or concrete unless it's very thin. You won't be listening to Never Gonna Give You Up on your way to the mailbox, but a kitchen run is definitely still on the table.\n\nThe software that comes with (Logitech G Hub) can be a little buggy, but your mileage may vary. My computer is an ancient relic from a bygone era, so if you're using hardware newer than 2015 you'll probably have a better time. It does allow lots of cool features and total control over the EQ for both sound and your voice, and I REALLY enjoy the built-in side tone feature, (which is when you can hear your own voice in exact real time through the headset as you speak, thus making it easier to speak naturally and not too loudly or even be purposefully quieter than you normally would) as the ear cups do muffle your own voice to a fair degree.\n\nThe sound quality of the mic is... not amazing, but it's still leagues better than anything that anyone I work with uses. Our company issues these little garbage headsets that make it sound like you're talking through a drive-thru speaker, so almost anything would have been an upgrade. Like I mentioned before, you can tweak the voice EQ in the settings but it's still limited. You're not going to get full blown desk mic performance out of this, but besides sounding a tad compressed it's still really not that bad. I have an awesome desk mic with an arm that I use for recording work stuff, and the headphones still work wonderfully without using the included mic attachment.\n\nThis gets it's own section: The noise cancellation on the mic. It's actually pretty sweet. I have to run a window A/C unit in the summer and a space heater in the winter in the room in which I work. They're not very quiet at all, but with this mic you'd almost never know they were on. You do get a bit of that \"fade in, fade out\" with the background noise when you speak, but this thing isn't some $1000 solution for those kinds of problems, so take it or leave it. It's really not that bad, you probably wouldn't even notice if I hadn't told you.\n\nAll-in-all, these are an extraordinary value for what they are. I don't really review stuff, and I'm supposed to be doing something else right now, but I just had the random urge to write this review so here I am. Buy these - you won't regret it.",
                "7": "Logitech has a reputation for making products that will last way longer than you need it to. This is no exception. My girlfriend bought me these headphones a while back, and i love them.\n\nThe comfort of wearing them is 11/10. These headphones are incredibly comfortable, i can (and sometimes do) wear these nonstop. Sometimes i forget i even have them on. They dont block much sound out, so if your looking for noise cancel/isolation this isnt really the headset for you. i would guess that 60% of the ambient noise can leak into the headset.\n\nThe mic is not great, if you are looking for a high quality microphone this isnt it. Its good enough to communicate through voice, people wont have a hard time understanding you, but this is not some high grade microphone. Its pretty standard, a benefit is the microphone piece itself can be removed and maybe even replaced since its just a standard headphone jack that the mic plugs into. So the microphone itself can be removed. Most of the time i have the mic in and it seems very durable. Even if you do break it buying a replacement mic bit is pretty cheap on amazon.\n\nThe main reason i give this set 5/5 stars despite the mic not being great is because they are the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn in my life. These are wearable, they are truly comfortable. I cannot stress how comfortable these headphones are, it is 11/10 in that department which carries an otherwise 4/5 star headset into being 5 stars.",
                "8": "RE: Logitech G733 Headset\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Windows 7 or later, MacOS 10.12 or later, PlayStation 4 or later, Nintendo Switch (Docked), USB Port 2.0+\n\nI read several reviews, and on some I can’t believe we’re talking about the same thing. This headset was specifically designed for gaming, it also works well with streaming, and is designed to be used with Logitech G HUB software. The G HUB software is needed to take full advantage of all the features.\n\nPRO’s:\n\nCOMFORT: This headset is super comfortable and ultra-light (9.8 oz) and is perfect for marathon sessions.\n\nSOUND: The sound is excellent, use G HUB to enable Advanced EQ and Surround Sound. The easiest way to adjust the sound using Advanced EQ is to run your game and G HUB, pick a preset filter (for instance; FPS) and adjust the EQ while playing, experiment with the sliders (and other filters) go as deep or high as you want, when your finished you can save the filter to any name you want, don’t worry about the original you can reset that to default. This headset focuses on spatial sound (with Surround Sound enabled) and does a great job, among the best I heard while gaming.\n\nBATTERY LIFE: Excellent 29 hours with RGB off and 20 hours with RGB on.\n\nMIC: I’ve used a few different headsets through the years and this one has the best mic. It’s not the quality of a high-end broadcaster's mic but it’s everything you need for gaming, and it does sound pretty darn good with Blue Voice filtering (G HUB) enabled. The mic is easily detached.\n\nBUILD: Very Good materials and craftsmanship.\n\nWIRELESS RANGE: Approximately 60 Feet\n\nRGB Lighting: Front facing on each driver housing, it works well and is controlled using G HUB.\n\nNOISE CANCALING: Passive, I find it perfect for me.\n\nCON’s:\n\nNothing really, for this price nothing needs to be entered here.",
                "9": "I got these for gaming, listening to music, and chatting with friends on Discord. Once I had them fully charged and set up, I tested the mic first which sounded great after just some minimal setting tweaking. Next, I started listening to some music while looking at the sound settings and before even tweaking anything yet, they started having a sudden robotic static vibration-like sound. I tried a quite a few things to fix this, but the only thing that actually worked was turning the headset completely off and then back on again. But the static robot sounds kept coming back no matter what I did around the 5-10 minute mark of use each and every time. My volume was only at 50% and I was using default settings for sound, so it couldn't have been anything I did, and tweaking the settings in an attempt to fix the issue just made it sound even worse. I'm assuming this is a manufacturing issue of some sort with this particular pair. Other than that issue, when they did work they were amazing, probably even one of the best sounding pairs I've ever had for under $200... if only they weren't messed up. I'm returning them and going back to a brand I'm more familiar with though, for now.",
                "10": "This headset does everything and more. It sounds great, super lightweight (hardly feel it on my head), mic quality is decent, and battery life is fairly solid. Only gripe with this headset is when it is in RGB mode there's a little buzzish sound that comes from the earcups (I know it sounds crazy but there's a buzz sound only when RGB is active). Due to the gripe, I keep the RGB off so the sound doesn't bother me while I game and watch videos. For the price point, it's solid and would recommend to others that want to swap from wired to wireless like me."

                "1": "**No spoiler review**\n\nAt this point, I could never have imagined the game industry without this game. Every once in a while, a game comes out that just says what everyone is thinking subconsciously but cannot quite make out the words, an itch that needs to be scratched, that puts all the pieces together in entertainment culture and builds the foundation for the next age for the game industry. This is that game.\n\nGameplay: The limits have been lifted. There are almost no restrictions to the possibilities of engagement with the environmental situations. Remember how amazing the Metroid screw jump felt in Metroid Prime 2, flying for the first time in Mario 64, jumping through the web in the Deku tree in Ocarina of Time, etc. In those moments, you knew you had experienced something that would change you, that you were playing a game that reached far beyond what you thought was possible. Now imagine a game that applies that feeling to every element of the game. While diverging some from past Zelda mechanics, they are changes that encourage you to grow as a player and engage in your environment and as such could not have been any other way. Don't worry, it is very nicely balanced.\n\nMusic: Even the music approach has been redefined for this game. Eerie, peaceful, and epic. I do not think a single note in this game is synthesized and the sensation feels like the game is calling to you or empathizing with you. The music element is used in a way that is unlike anything you probably have experienced before, hearkening back to the complex music development in intellectual music of the 20th century. The best visual reference I can give is that the music feels like water hitting your skin, that is how tangible it is.\n\nGraphics: When a design is this polished and revolutionary, graphics, while normally being the easiest to pinpoint, easily take more of a backseat, however this game has some of the most psychologically stimulating environments of any game in recent years. Graphics for this game cannot be discussed separate from gameplay as everything flows together in a near perfect fashion. The physics used in conjunctions with the models and layout of the map are immediately accessible and complex. Here are some examples of scope: The scope of the land is so vast and varied that every minute exploring provides an almost entirely different experience than the one just prior. A friend of mine is playing the game and while we have both been exploring the same areas, neither of us over the course of three days came across the exact same elements in the exact same way other than a town that the story led us both to. *In the overview of the world as seen in the picture on the box cover, every viewable (and not viewable) crevice is an entirely different world of exploration that is both gorgeous and fully interactive.\n\nDesign: Arguably the best quality of Breath of the Wild is how the elements come together. The expanse and themes, while Zelda, feel like they were taken out of the imagination of the renaissance 80s, a characteristic usually only touched on by unique cult-classic romps but here is fully realized in an immersive experience. The characters have such a unique and retro feel that they are both unsettling and comforting in the same breath. From the music to the landscape to the vocals and setting, this game truly brings together all the design elements in a masterful way.\n\nCONS: (nit-picking; do not read this section) Amidst all of these amazing elements, there are a few potential improvements that could be made.\n1) There are not voice-overs for all NPC dialog. This was a similar complaint that I had with the last 2 home console Zelda titles. If the production values on the game are high enough to immerse you as this title has done, all NPC lines should be voiced rather than only a few.\n2) The obvious cloud shadows during high sun are so realistic that it makes you look up, however the clouds in the sky do not coincide with the shadows. Often I would expect to see a close cloud or a storm front coming in, and not have either.\n3) Some powers suffer from quirky control mapping.\n4) Simple textures and meshes often are crude for the sake of object and environment scope. Forgiveable, but noticeable.\n5) The interactive detail in the game is so high that it is noticeable when Link's hands don't lineup with climbing elements or when objects quickly \"transition\" into items *cough* tree trunks *cough*\n6) Greatly miss the presence of at least a few major in-ground elements or dungeons. Most of the world is the same \"trial\" format with huge surface landscapes.\n7) More purpose, depth, and variety in the lives of the NPC characters that inhabit Hyrule. (As far as engine planning, this element could require as much preparation as the development of the world itself.)\n8) Inability to change the view if needed. (When in a tree, avoiding being seen or fire from horseback bokoblins, the leaves and branches become too much of a visual obstruction from accurately shooting arrows or observing.\n*All of these will likely improve or appear in future Zelda games overtime. Again, this game is the dawn of a new age and standard in game design.\n\nI have not been as satisfied and amazed with a game as I am with Breath of the Wild since Nintendo 64. This game has the same feeling as the first arrival of Ocarina of Time, Mario 64, Link to the Past, Final Fantasy 7, Super Mario Brothers, and Super Mario World. Up until now, nothing had dethroned Majora's Mask, Metroid Prime, and Ocarina of Time as my best, new favorite experiences, despite having played the large expanse and epic battles of Shadows of the Colossus, the emotional play of Resident Evil 4, the new learning approach and vicarious interactions of The Last Guardian, and nearly every other major release from Bethesda, Naughty Dog, and more. This game has surpassed all of my prior memories and claimed its rightful place as the game that defines gaming. I never thought I would feel that level of amazement again in the industry, but it is here and it isn't even VR. Game design at it's finest and why Nintendo still remains the definitive development standard.",
                "2": "Wow, who would have thought that after thirty incredible years of Zelda, with some of the best and most critically acclaimed games ever, Nintendo would manage to create what is, hands down, the best Zelda game to date in the form of “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, it is time to step aside. The Zelda series has a new champion. Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece, and feels destined to be a classic.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda series is, I must admit, my favorite video game series of all time (which is my favorite past-time) I have been absolutely obsessed with Zelda since I first played Ocarina of Time at the age of ten, sometimes obsessed to a rather unhealthy degree. I have loved every Zelda game, and especially every 3D Zelda, though none of them quite captured the same feeling of wonder and exploration. Until very recently, I would rank Ocarina of Time as my favorite video game of all time, but it looks as though that mantle is finally being passed to another game. Breath of the Wild feels like the Zelda game Nintendo has always wanted to make, but hasn’t been able to do to technological constraints or what have you. This game feels like the essence of what Zelda is, and always has been, about. While this is a lengthy review, this is a game that warrants such a lengthy review.\n\nStory: The story to this game begins in a place called the chamber of resurrection. Our hero, Link, has been asleep in a form of stasis for 100 years. When he awakes, he finds the land of Hyrule in ruins, starting with the desolate Temple of Time on the Great Plateau, the starting location. Link is told by a voice in his head that he must be the light to shine upon the land of Hyrule. After meeting a mysterious old man (throwback to the original Zelda game there) Link sets out on his quest to save Hyrule from the evil monster inside Hyrule Castle, known as the Calamity Ganon. Without spoiling too much of this story, I will only say that it is probably the most cinematic Zelda story to date. The fact that this game has voice acting, which is a first for the Zelda series, adds a lot of weight to the key story moments. The characters feel far more fleshed out, and they feel genuinely human. This game’s version of the titular princess Zelda might be the most relatable and interesting incarnation of the character to date, as she has genuine depth to her character. The other pivotal characters also feel uniquely more fleshed out as well, providing some of the most memorable story cut-scenes in a Zelda game, or any Nintendo game. Though Wind Waker and Skyward Sword might rival it, this is probably the best Zelda story to date. It does a great job of immersing you into the Gameplay and the world itself. Moreover, as you explore the world, you feel as though a story is being told through the exploration itself. One of the ingenious methods to the story-telling in this game is how it is told in a nonlinear nature, meaning that you can track down different pieces of the story in any order, and still have it all make sense in the end. Parts of the story are also optional, so it doesn’t ever feel like it’s spoon-fed to you, which is a good thing.\n\nPresentation: Right off the bat, I must say that Breath of the Wild is one of the most Gorgeous looking games that has ever been made to me. The simple, soft and vibrant colors also contain a hidden elegance and sophistication that can convey lots of emotion both in terms of story and Gameplay. The style feels reminiscent of Skyward Sword’s, which I also adored, but taken to the next level. This is the first Zelda title to be made in HD, and it shows. The character designs are flawless, and unforgettable. The stunning lighting effect, particularly when the sun rises and sets, remain beautiful to watch from start to finish, and the whole game just looks fantastic. This is magnified on the Nintendo Switch, with longer draw distances and a better performance overall than the Wii U version. There were still some frame-rate drops during moments in the game, particularly during battle moments against the Moblin enemies. While the frame-rate hiccups are still noticeable on the Switch, the game runs noticeably better overall. This minor complaint never ruined the game, or the immersion for me.\n\nI for one love the choice of music in this game. The subtle but brilliant use of piano cords make the world feel more natural and organic, and is contrasted brilliantly with the high-energy guardian themes and shrine theme. This, in a way, helps the thematic element of nature versus technology play out in its sound design. While the music may not be something you would listen to outside of the game in the same way you would with previous Zelda games, I believe the music and sound design is perfect for this game. That said, the horse riding theme, Hateno village, and Hyrule Castle are amazing pieces. The Hateno Village theme is simple and beautiful. The voice acting is also very solid, and I would love to see future Zelda games expand on it even more.\n\nWhat it comes down to is that the visual style choices, and the music help to make this, arguably, the most immersive and atmospheric open-world game I have ever played, and it serves the gameplay perfectly.\n\nGameplay: This is the best and most top-notch Gameplay I have ever experienced, period. The controls are so darn good that you could bounce a dime of them and get change leftover. As a veteran Zelda player, there was a learning curve to the controls at first, but after getting accustomed to them, they really did feel like second nature. This is the first 3D Zelda to have a jump button, a simple addition that changes the Gameplay mechanics significantly. Furthermore, the ability to climb in this game also adds a whole new dimension to the Gameplay.\n\nThis time around, the enemy AI is quite advanced for a Zelda title. The enemies also do quite a bit more damage to Link than they ever have before in a 3D title. What this means is that every encounter, and combat situation feels dangerous, and as though something is at stake. Link’s arsenal of weapons this time around includes far more than just a single sword, but many swords, as well as sticks, axes, spears, clubs, magic rods, and more. You also have a plethora of shields to use, and bows to use. The weapons in this game do break after being used a bit, which might be a point of contention to some. I love this mechanic, and feel that it forces you as the player to think and be strategic as to how you approach every encounter with an enemy. Link can also use stealth to sneak up on his enemies, destroy exploding barrels nearby and watch the enemies scream in horror (such as satisfying feeling,) or even use his rune abilities to take the enemies out before they know what hit them (more on that later.) The possibilities in this game feel almost endless. The coolest move Link can pull off in this game is the flurry rush; when fighting an enemy close-up, if you dodge just in time, Link will do a dodge or backflip in slow-motion, and proceed by striking the enemy several times, ending them in the process. It’s the coolest thing ever.\n\nIn this game, Link uses a plethora of abilities known as the Rune abilities. With these abilities, Link can create remote bombs that he can explode upon impact whenever desired. You can also use Cryonis, which creates ice blocks from water, which can be used as platforms to climb. You can use what is called stasis, which temporarily freezes objects in place, allowing you to hit them several times, after which point they go flying every which way. Then there is Magnesis, which is my favorite. This allows Link to push, pull, and lift heavy metal objects from afar, and use them to make paths, or even drop them on enemies from a distance. You’ll often stumble upon scenarios, particularly in the dungeons and shrines, that allow you to find your own clever ways of solving puzzles with these brilliant and fun mechanics. Like every aspect of the game, the experimentation alone will soak up hours of your life.\n\nSpeaking of shrines and dungeons, the dungeons in this game are vastly different than in previous Zelda games. Whereas previous Zelda’s had you collect keys, a key item, in order to make it to the final boss fight, this game’s dungeons are more based around experimentation and manipulation. Through using Link’s powers and abilities, as well as the map in this game, it allows Link to manipulate the layout of the dungeon, and essentially bend them to his will. This is another aspect of this Zelda that feels so fresh and fun. The bosses at the end of the dungeon are also really fun to fight. While the game only has four main dungeons, there are more than 100 mini shrines throughout. The shrines are essentially bite-sized dungeons, and play-out as such on a micro level. Many of them require you to use your rune abilities to solve them and progress, while others have you engage in a little boss fight of sorts with a guardian robot. Needless to say, these shrines are fantastic and provide some of the most enjoyable and mind-bending scenarios I’ve ever encountered, and manage to surprise at every turn. Moreover, the whole over-world almost feels like one giant, outdoor dungeon. What I mean by that is that while it isn’t literally a huge dungeon, you begin solving puzzles and thinking about where, and how you want to proceed to the next shrine or dungeon right of the bat. Simply getting to these shrines and dungeons feels like a puzzle in and of itself.\n\nBeing a truly open-world game, this game’s real obstacle, beyond even the enemies and the dungeons, is the world itself. This game is an open world adventure game, but it’s also a survival one. This world feels alive. The weather changes, the wild-life has a mind of its own, and the world will try to kill you in a multitude of ways. Whether it be by falling from foolishly attempting to climb massive heights, to lightning striking your metal items, to the wild animals such as bears and wolves that see you as their next meal. Furthermore, the realistic and ingenious physics engine makes the game world feel more natural.\n\nThe trick then, is to use the world to your advantage. By hunting wild animals and gathering supplies and ingredients, Link can cook a multitude of dishes and elixirs to refill both his heart meter (no hearts in pots or grass in this game) or his stamina gauge. You can hunt just about any wild animal you see in the wild. Cooked meat is always more effective than raw meat in straightening you, and you can combine it with other ingredients like fruits, vegetables, or grains and wheat to increase their effect. You can make potions by combining critters such as lizards, frogs, or bugs with monster parts that provide different temporary stat boosts. Just look out for the dubious food! You can also break chunks of rocks to find minerals, ore, and other materials. By buying and selling these goods, you create your own in game economy of sorts.\n\nThe other aspect of this game that makes it truly feel like the “open air” experience that Eji Aonuma called it is none other than the glorious climbing mechanic. You can climb almost anything in this game, whether it be a rock face, a cliff, buildings, towers, Hyrule Castle itself, the Temple of Time, you name it. You can even climb trees, and certain rock monsters that appear throughout the world. Climbing is yet another big component and aspect to this game that Nintendo really got down pat, and it does feel like a game changer. I’ve played several games where you can climb certain things, like Assassin’s Creed or Uncharted, but never has it been this freeing in how you can do it. This simple yet elegant mechanic really makes the already huge world feel even bigger. Climbing will slowly eat up your stamina gauge, so it’s up to you to figure out how you want to approach it, and finding little footholds is always a good way to rest when you need to. The only places you can’t climb every wall is in the dungeons and the shrines. The other open-air aspect to this world is the paraglider. When you reach the top of the mountain or a tower, you don’t need to worry about climbing all the way back down. Now, Link can simply jump off the cliff, and glide down to the world below ala Batman. This mechanic remains euphoric from start to finish. It is also an ingenious way to fix what could have been a potential problem before it happened, by allowing you to breezily get down a mountain pf tower right off the bat without having to climb all the way back down.\n\nIn this game, you can catch any number of wild horses, tame them, and check them into a stable. In past Zelda’s, your horse was Epona, and it was the only horse you could get. Here, there are several horses, some are harder to get than others, and they all have different stats. When you do catch your horse, it really does feel like your own horse, since you caught it, tamed it, and gave it a name. You can hold up to five horses at any given time, and ride around the world, into the villages, and even approach combat while on horseback with your melee weapons and bows. As someone who finds joy and excitement by simply exploring the game world, and doing random things, riding around Hyrule has never felt more fun. I used to love doing that all the way back in Twilight Princess, and this aspect puts that game to shame. The Horses can die, which may seem annoying to some, but I love it as, once again, it offers more strategy and thinking than previous games. When fighting a Guardian, it’s better going up against it on horseback as you have the element of speed on your side.\n\nUnlike previous Zelda games, where boss battles were restricted to the dungeons themselves, here in Breath of the Wild, you will often encounter boss like enemies in the world. These come in the form of giant rock monsters (Stone Talus,) Centaur-like creatures (Lynels, another throwback to Zelda on NES,) and the now iconic game enemy known as the Guardian’s (octopus-like robots that attempt to kill you throughout the game.) You can approach these enemies however you choose, or not approach them at all and leave them be at first. Throughout the game, as you become more powerful, you may be bold enough to take them on, it is all up to you. The first time I killed a Guardian was a defining moment for me, as was my first Lynel kill. What’s amazing is that even after you have several of the key upgrades, the enemies still feel like a threat.\n\nWhat makes the Gameplay in Breath of the Wild so good, and so perfect, is that you as the player can literally approach it however you want. The whole world is your oyster, and it’s up to you to figure out how you want to use it.\n\nReplay value. This game has lots of reason to play even after your first initial playthrough, which will likely take at least forty hours if you just do the main story. I have played this game from start to finish a few times already (and probably will several more times.) As it stands, you can find all of the optional things in the game (the Master Sword itself is optional,) Find and beat all of the shrines, collect all of the Korok seeds (plant like creature fans may know from Wind Waker,) and do any number of side-quests. The side-quests I have done have all been tremendously fun, and while the rewards may be simple, just playing them feels like a reward. You can help herd cucoos for a chicken-freak in Kakariko village, catch a royal white-steed, help a man start a village from the ground-up, and even build your own house in Hateno Village. This game has tons of replay value, apart from just the urge to go back and play it again. Because of the open-ended nonlinear nature of this game, you can replay the game from start to finish, and take a completely different path, even so far as taking on the last boss right away (though not a good idea if you value your life.) Just experimenting with all the different weapons, finding all the different locations and using your rune abilities will keep you distracted for quite some time.\n\n**Nintendo Switch differences:\nHaving played this game on the Switch as well as the Wii U, I can safely say that either version will deliver an incredible experience. That said, the Switch version is probably ever so slightly the superior version. Apart from running a little bit better, I found the switch controller very comfortable, particularly with how easy it is the detach the joy-cons from the controller slots to the tablet-screen. Speaking of which, playing this game on the go is a lot of fun. I would recommend saving the key story moments for the TV, but playing the game casually undocked with the Switch screen has felt great. **\n\nVerdict:\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece, and a game I feel will be looked at as a timeless classic. While it isn’t literally “perfect,” it has its occasional frame-rate issues, and the very occasional camera issue, it is, to me, as close to flawless as video game’s get. I haven’t been this immersed, this addicted, or simply had this much fun with a single player game in years, if not decades. This is the best game Nintendo has made in likely the past twenty years, if not ever. I have no regrets in saying I am ready to move on from Ocarina of Time being my all-time favorite video game, as Breath of the Wild now takes the cake. This is the game that really feels tailored to be played however you choose. It feels like the fully realized Zelda game that Nintendo has always wanted to make, and the one we as fans have been salivating for. A new Zelda of any kind is always a big deal, but this one feels uniquely special. I hyped this game to Death Mountain and back, and not only does it meet expectations, it defies them. This feels like a giant playground full of joy, wonder, discovery exploration, and fun. This is a game of survival, action, adventure, comedy, sadness, joy, and excitement, all wrapped into one package. To say it bluntly, this has everything that makes Gaming such a great past-time to me, and millions of people, and it manages to capture the essence of Zelda most of all. This is an absolute must-buy, and a must play. I would honestly encourage you to get a Wii U, or a Nintendo Switch if you do not already have one, to experience this Masterpiece. So get it, play it, enjoy it, and take a Breath of the magnificent Wild.\n\nCons:\nOccasional frame-rate issues\nPros:\nSublime Controls\nPerfect, Flawless, and incredible Gameplay\nMasterful Open-World Exploration\nFreedom and personal choice\nMechanics encourage experimentation\nFresh new dungeon design\nAmazing art direction\nBrilliant music and sound design\nGreat Voice Acting\nGreat Story and awesome characters\nLots of secrets to find\nLots of replay value\nOverall: 10/10\nPeace, Dana",
                "3": "I want to start off by saying that this is the first Amazon Review I've ever written, so I hope it's of some use to at least one individual that stumbles upon it.\n\nBefore I go into praising BotW I'd like to mention that there are frequent frame rate dips when playing the game on the Switch while docked. In handheld mode, this problem is all but nonexistent. Yes, there are times where it is noticeably annoying, but I would not go as far as to say that you shouldn't purchase this incredible game because of this issue.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the Nintendo Switch is a marvel to behold.\n\nGameplay:\nThe LoZ plays smoothly and responsively. When I first wrapped my fingers around the joy-cons and played this game, I felt like the placement of some of the commands felt a little out of place. Aside from the placement of the jump button (which can be changed) that forces you to claw the controller in order to run and jump, you end up getting used to the button layout. Unfortunately, there are a few connectivity issues with the joy-cons that Nintendo needs to improve upon, but if you're playing with a Pro Controller (highly recommended) than you won't need to worry about that. There are so many unique ways to combine food and other items in order to come up with creative dishes and elixirs to aid you during your journey. The combat is what you'd expect from a Zelda game, but with the inclusion of weapon durability and variety, no encounter is similar to the next. Also, Link can now scale almost anything due to a new climbing mechanic. It is the best feeling to climb up large mountains and look down at the gorgeous world that Nintendo has created for us. Sometimes you will reach the top of something just before running out of stamina, and I can honestly say that moments like these are what make the game feel so special.\n\nDifficulty:\nI wanted to touch on this a little bit because I for one don't consider many of the Zelda games to be especially difficult in terms of combat encounters, but this new entry changes that. If you're fighting multiple enemies at once, be prepared with a strategy beforehand or else get your butt handed to you. Enemies down the line will give you a hard time for sure.\n\nEnvironment:\nBreath of the Wild is a gorgeous game and saying that still doesn't do it justice. The art style fits perfectly with the series. The world is beautiful, vibrant, and very much alive. There will be moments where you'll just stop and enjoy the sunset just because of how much the weather impacts you throughout the game. After an entire night trying to climb cliffs in the rain, the sun rising and sky clearing is a brief moment of reprieve. The wildlife and assortment of plant life is extremely expansive in terms of diversity and uniqueness. There is just so much to look at. Not to mention, the map itself is HUGE! I've clocked almost 30 hours into the game and there are still many areas i have yet to explore. It's exciting to think about!\n\nStory and Characters:\nIt's a Zelda game so you probably already know what to expect, but I think Nintendo has upped the game in this regard even still. The characters are each likable in their own way, and the relationships they have with each other make you enjoy the game even further. I don't want to go into too much detail about that for fear of spoilers but just know that the events of this story impact the characters in ways that give you an inviting insight into their emotions.\n\nMusic and Voice Acting:\nThe music is miraculous. Most of the time throughout your journey the only thing you will hear is the sounds... of nature. Birds chirping, deer running, horses galloping, rain falling, and lightning cracking. It's amazing! Of course when you enter a town or other occupied area, that's when the BotW soundtrack truly shines.\nThis is the first time a Zelda game has included voice acting, and I'm here to tell you that you won't be disappointed. You will be very judgmental of the vocal performances at first, but that's only because it's SO WEIRD hearing real voices come from the characters that you've grown to know and love over the years. Once you get over that initial surprise you will begin to appreciate the performances, which I believe to be very well done. I absolutely love Zelda's voice actress. I was never a huge fan of the character myself, but I've adopted a whole new appreciation of the character by the way she's portrayed in this game.\n\nTo wrap things up, I'd like to say that this game might be one of the few games ever created that is a MUST PLAY for anyone that's a fan of video games. It's just a fun, beautiful, memorable, and unique experience that anyone watching/playing can admire.\nI've played many incredible video games in my lifetime, but The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the only one that forced me to write an Amazon Review.\n\nI'm absolutely positive that you will be 'blown away' by The Breath of the Wild ;)",
                "4": "This is just a fight game I recieved a Used game that was missing it's pamphlet the used order was cancelled that this changed to new condition without approval we would have possibly just cancelled. It is nothing like Zelda Ocarina that was a group of small mini games all sewn together in a fairly great fable. At first I was very hesitant to buy this game because a serious gamer said he beat it in 30 hours and we had a few years of fun playing Zelda Ocarina of Time all it's side games and mini games while using it to teach the children to read instructions. They became great fans of Zelda and when they got older asked for a Wii they specifically asked for the game and bow set up for I guess the name was Link for their birthdays as they both are born in March. I have not played this Link line of games since Nintendo 64 and as I play through it not using walk throughs as I was told it is a short game I am learning this young man must have skipped all the side actitivies, competitions and looking for all the game gifts just fought his way through the game.\nI think if the information that comes with the new game helps play the game it would have been worth purchasing a new game or at least a book to help me find things. I do not know if there is a map to discover in the game like in Ocarina but I am very lost and tracking backwards without a good map in this game. I hope it turns up somewhere or I can buy it as I just bought salt for the recipes. The recipes are fun it would be nice if I could keep a list of what was done so I can make the better ones again as I discover them in game play. I find the mountains very difficult to climb without the speed and stamina elixers.\nIt is growing on my slowly.\nThis is not a child's game like Zelda Ocarina of time with brighter colors that would probably be excellent updated for the Switch for younger children...but it is an adventure game. At first because it is a big jump from the 64 game I did not like it but as time went on it began to grow on me I am beginning to like it but I sure would like a map I am so lost even driving without a physical recent map.\nDo you want a nice review or do you want the truth\nThe graphics apparently are very good on Zelda Breath of time for the Switch.\nBut like with Skylanders Imaginators which runs on Toys to Life which I began playing because my nephew plays it on my Switch gifted to me for Christmas.\n\nI found the new Switch Zelda game to be very difficult loaded constantly with Boss monsters and difficult puzzles.\nThese is only normal run and Pro run games so it is apparently designed for the hard core gamer unlike the Zelda Ocarina of time I bought used for near new price many years after it as designed for the Nintendo 64 because it was more a younger persons puzzle and adventure game loaded with mini games and not as much violence.\n\nThis is a Hard core games game apparently someone who just finds a way to fight to the end then resells or soon after purchasing it like I bought it used missing all the pamphlets and information and then it was tried to be foisted off on me as a new game.\n\nIf it had been new I would have returned it because I am a beginnger level player always will be even though I have playe 20 years.\nI use walk throughs and information to help me play most games.\n\nBut as this is a constant fight fight fight M for Mature Violent game now if you are a hard core gamer you can rent the game fight through ignore all the side quests, not enjoy the horses which are very untameable and do not follow good directions so much I often found myself walking and whistling for the away horse.\n\nIf you like near impossible puzzles and fighting very few clues in a game that does not like to let you go back where you have been and just want to fight through a game this is the game for you.\nBut rent it and play it on the Switch handheld counsel as it looks very washed out on the tv.\n\nDesigned for the Switch and for the Hardcore gamers\n\nNot a child's game.\nBut if you are a hard core gamer I suggest you get the Ammibos to up the gameplay a bit which they do not tell you can be used in the game and run it on professional level before you try to resell it.\nAlso the harder part of the game than the monsters are some of the many Shrine puzzles one which runs like a marble roll game there is a trick I am working out on how to solve it.\n\nIf it was for a child or a novice player and less about fighting and adventure I am sure it would be kept by the right people driving up the pice like Animal Crossing has.\n\nIf you want a review that you do not pay for\ndon't punish the honest person for saying I don't like it\nBut the hard core gamers love it.\nSo I knew when someone told me they beat it in 30 hours it as probably just a bang bang fight fight hit hit hard core gamers game.\n\nI rate it M for Mature and Lots of Game violence as the bully monsters constnatly beat up travelers whom you can save to come back and find them stuck eternally in the same scenario with the same monsters for the same small monster organ rewards for killing them and saving the victims.\n\nI found most the recipets to be near worthless against Boss Monsters which this game is loaded with.\n\nI give it a big thumbs up for young hard core fight gamers but for novice and children along with parents I suggest you find a game that is less violent as apparently children are shooting us after playing this lot of very violent games out now.\nIf you are a hardcore gamer like the Game store employees are rent the game don't open the package and try to sell it off to me as new after you have used it or here. And remember some of us who are not serious gamers need the pamphlets and all the help we can get because our minds are different than yours we like to stop eat the apple, cook the meals, see the worlds all over Built by Nintendo and buy the Amiibos.\nI did not want to buy the game at the game store as I knew as hard as the employee tried to sell it to me \"new\" at a reduced price he had played it while off work and then brought it back repackaged it. Don't sell me a game think I don't know it is not new and do not change the name to new condition and then charge me illegally to my credit card for a used game especially when I know it is missing every single pamphlet that it comes with that gives information like you can use an Amiibo in the game.\nThis game after all these years seems to still be a single player game which having the option for 2 to 4 player adventuring and fighting the huge monsters online or at home would surely be more entertaining.\nIf I had paid full price I would be disappointed and stuck with a Used game. Rent these games first before buying if you can find a place to rent them. But so far I have put the Switch down sometimes for months like the Xbox One which has not been used in over a year as the PS3 controllers can be run wired not run out of battery power, run on the tv and the cherished but not mass produced PS vita system which still runs high used because of limited production and high popularity for the number produced.\nAs I understand it is a loved Gamer hard core game I gave it a 5 star\nbut for me I give it as sit in the corner now for awhile if the horses are not able to be tamed and are programmed to run away from any sigh of trouble or into a big fight to kill you no in between the horses are crazy. So just walk through.\n\nIf all you want to do is run to the end not enjoy the fabulous perk hard to tame and catch seriously wild horses that develop personality issues such after encountering Ogres and other monsters rent the game don't try to resell it to me as new as I buy new games also but as these sold out it has been difficult locally to find it not being resold as a new game when it is used also.",
                "5": "It's works great. It's a fun game. It has a very big map and everything can be climbed. It's a Zelda RPG with environmental factors in this game. It's funny watching Link get hit by lightning in a storm and when they have him run around in a circle. The kids ignored the marker on the map and went to turn on all the towers, wood spirits, and shrines before going to a ninja village.",
                "6": "I just wanted to update my review for the game. There's no doubt this game deserves a 5 star score. It's bold and Nintendo created a world that's bigger than any game to date. I want to point out that I did beat the game and completed most of the dungeons that are spread out throughout the game. I'm sure by now you've heard all the good and great things about the game, but there should be the negative as well.\n\nFirst, I did not like how Nintendo undermined the weapon system. Weapons and shields break too often. How does this effect the game? You're travelling the vast land, yet you feel reluctant to fight the moblins and goblins because you don't know if it will be worth it for your item to break. Even \"unbreakable\" items can wear out and need time to recharge.\n\nSecond, if Nintendo wanted to make the travelling worth while combat and fighting should reward you. Sure there are items and chests to gain if you take over a moblin base, but the items are often not worth it. I would see someone trying to make the case that you need to battle enemies to gain their parts to upgrade armor, but once you upgrade, fighting becomes pointless. There's no experience gained or leveling up, so why not just run away most of the time. I have played Horizon Zero Dawn and in my opinion, HZD's battles felt more Zelda-like than Botw. The weapons and items in HZD seemed to have more value than BOTW. Enemies take more strategy to beat in HZD and every weapon had a purpose to defeating an enemy with a weakness to it. I'm not saying HZD is a better game or BOTW is a better game mind you. I'm not trolling Zelda, I gave it a 5 star score. For those who played both games, you will see what I am talking about with the enjoyment of battles in HZD.\n\nThird, bosses have been simplified. You do not need a special item or much strategy to beat the bosses. In past Zelda's the dungeon's secret item would be the weakness to the boss. But in BOTW all you need is a strong weapon and armor to beat bosses. The bosses were not overly creative. Each boss was only marginally different from the previous.\n\nWhere are the iconic items? Where is the boomerang, the hookshot,, heavy boots, bug net, fairy bottles, etc, etc. Items were a central theme in all the Zeldas. Why did they take that out? It was one of the biggest surprises or exciting parts of previous games when opening a chest. Putting value into items is something I would like to see reinstated in future games.\n\nFourth, the epic field music is gone and replaced by a subtle piano and atmospheric tunes. In all of the previous Zeldas, I would be either humming or whistling tunes from Zelda for days after I had finished. Yes, the game does have one theme that reoccurs when something important happens or when you beat a boss, or when you find a stable, but not a very memorable soundtrack.\n\nFifth, many of the side quests do not have much bearing on the actual main story. Sure, some side quests in the game will help you gain helpful items and armor, but it does not change the ending or how NPC will react to you. Since Nintendo wanted to take a page from the western rpg genre, decision making should have been impactful to the outcome of the game. POTENTIAL SPOILER--->From what I know there are two endings to the game and I have gotten both by visiting all the specific areas in the game that's part of a side quest.\n\nSixth, does bigger mean better? In the case that there are 120 mini dungeons in the game, they had to make the world bigger to fit them, but in my opinion, making the world so large made things a little tedious. Sure, there is fast travel, but getting to each location seemed a little bit of a chore especially since fighting enemies was not rewarding, and other than finding mini dungeons and moblin bases, there was nothing much to do. I don't consider hunting or gathering foods that much of reason for the large map.\n\nIn no way am I bashing Zelda. In fact, I do believe it deserves to be the game of the year. Even with what I consider as flaws, the good outweigh the negative greatly. I just hope Nintendo can take some advice from their fans to improve the next installment.",
                "7": "Game of the year!!! Congrats Nintendo!\n\nVery beautiful game.\nI didn't want it to end. After 100 hours I decided to beat Ganon. I completed 112 shrines, collected over 200 korok seeds and completed many quests. I decided to start a new game and it still feels like a new experience. I find myself going straight to my favorite parts of the game and it is still amazing that there is no mandatory order or path to keep going.\nI feel like over the years everyone has been spoiled with better graphics and gameplay. The most complaints I heard about the game was frame rate/lag issues, especially around multiple monsters or non-playable characters. But that means nothing to me. I experienced it a few times but it did not drop the game rating from 5 stars.\nI love the scenery. No matter where you are there is always something beautiful to look at. The landscapes are gorgeous and I love the way everything shines when it rains. Catching wild horses is also fun. I swear I have caught over 40 or 50 horses.\nIt doesn't matter what you get into in the game. There are always tricks to getting more of what you want. Take a picture of whatever you want to find, vegetables, stones, ingredients, tools, weapons, anything really, and your Sheika slate (tablet that Link uses in the game) will help guide you to find more. I'm always looking for precious metals/stones and it is the easiest way to get 10 thousand rupees or more. However much you need or want.\nThere are so many quests and challenges. Puzzles that require you to find different characters to get hints or answers. Or to help you find a location of something. Everyone has their own likes and opinions, but to me, Breath of the Wild has no frustrating tasks or quests. I have enjoyed every bit of the game. I loved, loved, loved Breath of the Wild.\n\nThe first Zelda game I played was on the Gameboy, Oracle of Seasons. I thought it was fun and great. Especially for its time and portability. I did not consider myself a big Zelda fan until Twilight Princess, though. I own the Wii version and the HD version for the Wii U. I think it will always be my favorite. It is hard to beat a game that allows you to turn into a wolf! I was very excited when I found out that you could bring wolf Link into Breath of the Wild and even use Epona. I use both of them all the time. I'm also very excited about the upcoming DLCs and new story to come. UPDATE: They are here! Very good so far! Good back stories.\n\nRecently, I have started playing Ocarina of Time on my 3DS. It is hard to get used to the controls, the smaller screen, and lower graphics but I have heard from so many of my friends that it is one of the best Zelda games ever made. It is hard to compare Breath of the Wild to Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword because you do not have all of the freedom to roam around wherever you want. Breath of the Wild IS freedom. Skyward Sword did give you the option to fly anywhere above the clouds and the worlds were very big but it still does not come close to Breath of the Wild. I haven't played Wind Waker, Majora's Mask or other remakes and older entries of the series but I will eventually.",
                "8": "Im thankful for you always getting what I order correct and ALWAYS ON TIME OR EARLY",
                "9": "edit: Sorry this turned into a long review. There's actually more I wanted to mention but it's already too long.\n\nI really wanted to give this 5 stars but couldn't quite get there.\n\nI'm not really sure how to frame this review. I'll try and make it generic and not have any plot spoilers. I played this game at least once a day for about 6 weeks (march 11th - april 24th). I don't know of a way to see an official our count but guessing I would say between 150 and 250 hours - when I did finally beat it - I did do a lot of optional things though. Also, I only played it almost entirely with the pro controller\" and a little bit with the Switch in portable-console-mode. Never used the detachable wireless controllers as a controller. I usually got around 2 1/2 - 3 hours as a portable by the way.\n\nI'll preface this by saying the last zelda i finished was Ocarina, 20 years ago. Haven't really kept up with Nintendo or zelda since then. Maybe some old zeldas through emulation. Still have TP and skyward sword on my \"to do list\".\n\nWhat would someone like me associate with a zelda game? A big over world with at least 8 dungeons of varying amounts of difficulty finding them, locked off areas that aren't accessible until certain items are found (like hookshot, the higher strength bracelet and the boomerang) and of course dungeons that include keys, a compass and a map.\n\nWell this zelda has a twist and that idea: instead of 8 fairly large dungeons and areas locked away until you get certain items...there's 120 relatively short shrines only four of which are required to complete the game. And there aren't really areas locked away until you get a specific item. Maybe an area is extremely difficult with only 3 hears and no stamina but it's not physically impossible to get there.\n\nThis being an \"open world\" game I can't help but compare to other games of that kind, the freshest on my mind being the elder scrolls games. Skyrim for instance had weapon forging, marriages, a whole magical system, an economics system...far and away more complex than and in-depth than this in other words. But that's the way I have always remembered Zelda games: an \"RPG\" but much more \"accessible\" to kids and players who may not want to spend hundreds of hours doing everything. Actually if you were going to make an elder scrolls comparison Oblivion would be the most obvious in comparison (as I recall it had a lot of ...I want to say oblivion gates..that were optional to beat).\n\nIn BotW you don't really \"level up\" and there isn't actually an experience system. You finish shrines to get spirit orbs and then you upgrade either stamina (how long you can go before stopping to rest) or hearts (hit points). In other words you don't specialize in different skill sets. You can cook the best meal there is from the word go if you know the recipe and where to get the ingredients. And the same with archery and weapons skills: you don't get better and better at spears if you specialize in them, it's the same from the first moment as it is at the final fight. And I kind of like that.\n\nOver the course of my play through I went through several stages:\n1. starting the game, learning the controls, finding shrines and not towers with sheika slate scope, running from bokoblins...\n2. blowing myself up with bombs, continually crouching while trying to run away from mini-bosses, seeing that game over screen a lot\n3. being addicted to seeing what's over the next horizon, what's over there, staying up until 3am on a work night. This is probably the peak of the experience.\n4. having uncovered the whole map, having to track down those final shrines and finishing the side quests\n5. The final stage is kind of...frustrating. I didn't want to finish yet but there wasn't much left to do. The main point of side quests is get either money or \"mad loot\". But at some point I had \"four-starred\" my favorite armor and had 26k rupees so that kind of took away the motivation. So it was more \"farming mini bosses\" to get the ingredients and high level weapons I needed.\n\nSo I would say you reach \"peak botw\" around 12 hearts with two divine beasts under your belt.\n\nWhat are the cons?\n- As mentioned before, I kept crouching and very inconvenient times. The analog stick that is used for movement/running, when pushed down, makes Link crouch. This frustrated me to know end. I really wish there was a \"disable crouch\" option, even if temporary. Would made things so much easier.\n- the technology used for the game is kind of...not powerful enough. For instance animals (or lizards) will run away and then simply disappear. For instances and dear will be right in front of me running circles and then just fade away right in front of me. I find this annoying. As is the sand seals and that can't pull me over rocks but can dive into rocks as if they were sand. It just seems like a lack of attention to detail or...maybe just a flaw in the technology. Really takes me out of the immersion.\n- The music. Or rather lack thereof. There's a appropriate sounds when something is chasing after Link or there's a mini-boss in the area. But a lot of times it's either generic ambient music or no music at all, just wind blow through trees. I realize Nintendo isn't on forefront of technology but if you're really going to leave out music how about some way of importing custom music? Pandora? Something? Probably too much to ask.\n- Even with the latest patch (as of april 25th 2017) I get some frame rate issues (I played with it on the dock/connected to a TV 99% of the time). Not very often and I don't remember it actually affecting game play. But that doesn't make it any less annoying.\n- I have the physical version of the game and sometimes those loading times kind of get to me. Feels like I'm in the early 90s waiting for my 1x CD ROM to load. I did get a lot of tips for the loading screens, but I would still rather have faster loading.\n\nNeutral:\n- The weapon system. I think I figured out what they were going for: since there is no crafting or repair system for weapons and shields, this is the way the game upgrades your effectiveness. As you complete shrines and divine beasts the weapons slowly improve. Actually the enemies not all of them) slowly upgrade as well to be more difficult, thereby dropping improved weapons. It's supposed to be an organic thing, which it is up to a certain point.\n- the motion controls: technically they \"work\" but I didn't appreciate them for things like aiming the bow so the first thing I did was turn them off. There are still shrines that make you use them though.\n- the plot: not over the top great, no great twists or anything. Just a pretty straight forward thing. It's kind of like the plot of the movie \"the blues brothers\" now that I think about it. Link is \"getting the band back together\" for one last gig. And also bailing someone out of tough situation. Except link doesn't have a partner, it's just him trying to talk people into fighting again coming to the aid somebody. It's actually pretty impressive the way they pieced the plot together through these \"memories\" that are entirely optional and can be watched in any order yet still fits together into a cohesive whole by the end.\n- optional quests and mini-games. To expand your inventory capacity (for melee weapons/bows/shields) you have to trade in korok seeds. You find korok seeds but searching out of the way places for things that \"seem out of place\". Like a circle of rocks obviously missing a piece to make a full circle. Complete the circle, get a seed. Collect enough seeds and trade them for more inventory capacity. So you explore the world, solve some minor puzzles and in trade you \"earn\" more inventory space. It seems fair (I found just under 200 seeds, which sounds like a lot until you find out there's 900 total). There's also a take-a-pic-of-everything mini game thing. I was wondering at the start why there was no central repository explaining all the various enemies. And then I got the thing that allowed for photo taking. So it's \"build-your-own beastiary\". I don't know that there's a reward for a complete repository. But it is helpful. There's also some other mini-games like gliding for the longest and riding a shield down a snow path. Those are fun more than anything.\n- the way the monsters (and most everything else) re-spawns: I think I like it. I mean it's kind of explained in the context of the plot and it's relatively predictable. I once got stuck on a certain island the night before that re-spawn event. It was like living through \"groundhog day\" having to beat the island multiple times to try and finish it. In the \"late game\" you may start to plan all your adventures around the next re-spawn.\n\nPositives:\n- It is a very compelling open world. I spent many a night exploring random areas, trying to finish puzzles in shrines and fighting various mini bosses. It's often hard to put down.\n- the gained abilities from the start of the game makes it very fun to experiment. And the shrines make you \"think outside the box\" in your creative use of these abilities to solve the puzzle.\n- speaking of abilities, almost always when i couldn't figure out puzzle the answer seemed to be \"use crynosis\" (giant pillar of ice). Not sure why I had so much trouble remembering that was a thing.\n- I actually like a lot of the mini bosses. The Hinox (giant one-eyed things that seem to enjoy sleeping) were intimidating at first but eventually quite fun to fight. And a good source of relatively high power bows. Among other things.\n- the recipe/cooking system. I still don't know all the super-great recipes by name/by heart. But I know enough the create enhancements for speed/stealth/heart recovery/recovery+extra hearts/attack up/defense up/recover stamina/extra stamina wheels. And that's what I really want anyway. Never did figure out what good all those blocks of salt are for. Guess that's why I have hundreds of them.\n- I like the logic of the game. For instance in the starter area is a required shrine but the area is too cold to go through without losing hearts. You only have three hearts so this is rather important. There are hints of a recipe that will provide cold resistance as well as a way to get a warm vest. But I didn't know how to cook or that the \"warm doublet\" was an option. So as is probably logical i used a torch to provide just enough warmth to get through the cold area. Of course there are also bad guys to get through along the way and the torch goes out when you switch to a weapon so then you have to find some place to re-light a torch. You can also light wood weapons on fire of course. And actually where you start finding element enhanced weapons this works the same way: in the hot desert equip a great ice sword to stay a little cooler (and a fireblade to stay a little warmer). There's also things like ice-based enemies that die in one hit with a fire weapon, and fire enemies that die from ice weapons. Just makes sense.\n- Actually, you indirectly learn how to do with lightning strikes pretty quickly (if you have metal weapons equipped you'll likely get struck by lightning). And this knowledge comes in handy with the electricity-based puzzles (metal weapons conduct electricity). As does water. Comes in handy for disabling groups of enemies standing in water.\n- It seems like for every \"that's not fair\" element you find there is a \"that's very generous of you\" element to counter it. For instance it's not at all difficult to stumble across an enemy entirely over your head in abilities/hit points/etc. and can insta-kill you without much more than a look. As if to counter this you have the transportation/beam out ability you get pretty much first thing. At any moment/any time you can bring up the map and warp away without any consequences of any kind. About to drown? Or part way up a mountain and out of stamina? Laser about the take your head off? No problem, bring up the map and warp away. Doesn't cost any rupees or hearts or anything nor are there restrictions around enemies being around etc. Insta-gone.\n- the armor system: lets just say collect everything you see that you can pick up. Every much room, every firefly, every apple, every horn. Because you will need it, and I don't think there's any sort of limit to how big that stack of teeth can get (or I didn't find the limit, anyway). You'll need it to upgrade your armor, which you will want to do for the \"set bonus\". There's the fireproof suit for walking around on death mountain without instantly catching on fire. There's the rock climbing suit for super fast climbing, there's the sheika outfit for super-stealth, there also one for extreme cold and extreme heat. The one that allows for walking around inside in a volcano doesn't help for traveling in the desert. Not sure why. Point is you will probably want that extreme cold outfit upgrade so you're \"unfreezable\" and the rubber suite upgraded so your \"unshockable\". And extreme heat one so you're not dressed as...well lets not spoil the surprise.\n- the combat system: the sooner you learn the parry/super dodge system the better off you'll be. Took me forever to get the hang of it. But it's definitely worth it. Lets just say you can kill the guardians in the starter area with nothing more than a pot lid...\n\nHow much one likes this game I think will be directly proportional to how open one is to open world games (like the elder scrolls series). I never had any trouble figuring out where to go or what to do next in this game (and Impa is there to remind you). The plot is entirely optional as are the \"divine beasts\" and 116 of 120 shrines. You can waste time time and do whatever you want in any random order you like. That's either terrifyingly flexible or wonderfully freeing, depending on your tastes. Think of it as a really watered down version of all the famous open world franchises. Which isn't a bad thing.\n\nOne tip to leave you with: that area around Zora's domain, the long windy road with all the lizard men, that is definitely the place for gathering arrows. And you will run low on arrows...a lot. I was doing that every re-spawn time for a while there.",
                "10": "I've put somewhere between 50-75 hours into this game and I have to say that I just don't get the gushing, unqualified love for this game. In fact, after about 10-15 hours, I was pretty close to just giving up on it, but I kept playing it expecting for it to click. It never did. In my view, it's a OK game, but that's it. It's not the best game on the Switch, and it's not the best game in its genre.\n\nThe good:\n- The developers obviously put a lot of time into the game, and it shows. There are a lot of different landscapes, the artwork is interesting, and I can only remember one bug in all the time that I played. It is a polished, finished game. Especially with large, open-world games, that's pretty rare, and I appreciate that.\n\n- The controls are solid, although there is some awkward button-mashing required in spots that can be frustrating. This is particularly true for the dodge mechanic, which requires a three-button combination that, if not executed just right, will just result in a crouch that gets you clobbered by a bad guy.\n\n- It's suitable for children, which is nice. Few of these types of games are.\n\nThe not so good:\n- The game is awfully repetitive. There is a really big, open, world, and that's great. Many of the areas have different artwork and are pretty to look at. But really, most of the territories are basically the same with different artwork layered over the top.\n\n-With a big, open world, you would expect that there would be a lot to do. There's really not, at least as far as I can tell. There is a main quest and there is discovering shrines. There are a handful of side quests, but they're pretty one-dimensional and involve either discovering a shrine or running an errand for someone. Other games like this (Fallout, Skyrim, Witcher, Horizon Zero Dawn, GTA, etc.) have some pretty involved B stories that can be just as good as the main game.\n\n-BOTW is full of some interesting ideas that are executed in a way that just makes the game too tedious and downright boring in spots. For example:\n\n- There are something like 120 shrines to discover. That sounds like a lot, but all the shrines fall into one of three categories: a fight, a platformer, or a puzzle. Every shrine is a variation of one of those three, and with 120, that gets pretty old. In Fallout 3, a much better game, each Vault had a different story and was relatively unique. Because of that, they were quite fun and interesting to explore. There's nothing interesting about the shrines in BOTW once you play the first few. Beating the shrines is important to level up your character, though, so there is a lot of repetitive grinding.\n\n- There are a lot of mountains and cliffs in the game. It makes for interesting landscape, and you can climb them, which is a cool and different idea, but climbing is very slow, and some of the cliffs are quite big. It's just boring to sit there for 45-60 seconds doing nothing but holding the climb button. Worse, sometimes it rains and the cliffs become too slick to climb. But if you need to go up the cliff to get where you're going, there is nothing to do but stand there and wait for it to stop raining. I've actually just put down the controller and left to make myself a sandwich while I waited for it to stop raining. What's the point of that?\n\n-Speaking of rain, the weather changes. That's neat I guess, but they've messed it up by making it a game mechanic. Sometimes it will storm, so if you are holding a metal weapon or a metal shield, you'll get struck by lightning and die (this also causes an inventory management problem, which I discuss below). It rains a lot in the game but doesn't always storm, so it's easy to miss when it starts if you're not paying attention. You'll just be wandering around and then get struck by lighting and instantly die. That's annoying. It also goes from extreme hot to extreme cold rather quickly. If you don't have the proper clothing, you will die very quickly. So for example, in the desert, the daytime is very hot and the nighttime is very cold; each require special outfits. This might be realistic, but time passes quickly and it gets old to have to keep changing outfits every five minutes. Again, how is this a fun game mechanic?\n\n-There is a big, open-world map, so getting from place to place can be tedious. Other open-world games, like Fallout or Witcher, solve this problem by being able to fast travel basically anywhere. You can fast travel in BOTW, too, but you are limited to being able to fast travel only to two types of locations: towers and shrines. That means that after you fast travel, you often have a lot of walking (or worse, climbing) to get to where you want to go. That's boring. You can also get a horse, but because so much of the map is mountainous, their utility is rather low.\n\n- Your weapons and shields deteriorate. That's fine, plenty of other games have done that. But in those games, there is a way to repair your equipment. In this game, there isn't, and most of the weapons will deteriorate very quickly--just a handful of fights with monsters. So you have this perverse incentive when you get good weapons to not use them because of a concern that they will break and then you won't have them later for the boss battles or occasional more powerful monster that you run across.\n\n- By itself, the deterioration issue probably wouldn't be terrible. When it is combined with a limited inventory and specialized weapons, it becomes downright awful. You only have a few weapons slots, but you have to horde weapons because you never know when they might break. Worse, some monsters a particularly vulnerable to a single type of weapon--ice sword, fire sword, etc. So you always want to make sure you have one of each of those. And, when it storms, you can't use a metal weapon, so you have to keep a wooden weapon, too. You wind up always fretting about what weapons to keep and which to drop, and when. It's frustrating to drop a weapon that you need later because you didn't have room for it at the time. It's just unnecessary.\n\n-To recover health, you have to cook meals in a pot. That's fine, but it takes a lot of time and clicks to gather items out of your inventory and then a few more seconds for them to actually cook. It doesn't sound like much, but if you want to prepare 10-15 meals to prepare for a boss battle (or because you don't have the proper equipment and need the temporary boost that a meal provides), it's really tiresome to sit at the fire and do stuff over and over again.\n\n- There are really only a handful of different monsters you fight. The monsters that you meet in the first few minutes of the game will be seen through the rest of the game, except more powerful. When you go to a new area, it's basically the same monsters, except there is an \"ice\" version, a \"fire\" version, or a \"skeleton\" version.\n\nIn sum, the bones are here for a good game, but it's just not a good game. I can tell they put a lot of work into the game, and for that I am appreciative. But gosh, shouldn't the game be fun? Three stars is as high as I can go, and that might even be a bit generous.\n\nIf you like the open world game, you've probably already played many of the games that are far and away better than BOTW. Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, GTA and Witcher (available on Switch) are clearly better. If you are looking for an open world game that is suitable for a child, Lego City Undercover (available on Switch) is better than BOTW, and usually half the price. If you also have a PS4, Horizon Zero Dawn is a game that has the same motif as BOTW, but is much, much better in nearly every way."

                "1": "I spend all my time on my computer. Be it working from home or gaming/watching streams, it's where I live. I've always used wired headphones, and without fail, they all fail or get broken in some way. That, and the chords seem to always be in the way. Then I bought these headphones.\n\nI was hesitant at first, I feared that the headphones would always die out of nowhere, when I most needed them. I looked at the advertised battery life and I absolutely did not believe it. I was just skeptical about wireless headphones in general. I was in for surprise.\n\nI've had these headphones now for 10 months, and I can honestly say I will never go back to wired headphones.\n\nPros:\n- The battery life is amazing. Like I said, I'm on my computer all the time, and I've gone months without charging. This is the big selling point for me. You don't need to constantly worry about having enough charge in your headphones.\n- Build quality. A lot of headphones I've had in the past (I don't buy cheap either) seem to break where the headband and the earpiece meet. This is because they use cheap plastic. This product uses metal, and has with stood my rough abuse. The soft part that goes around the ears is also comfortable, and never has cause irritation after hours of wear at a time. It has also survived several kidnappings by my toddler who likes to throw, slam, and bend everything he can get his hands on.\n- Detachable Mic. I detach/Attach my mic multiple times a day, and it just keeps working every time. Sound quality is good.\n\nCons:\n- Inaccurate battery readouts. You can tap the power button and a voice will tell you what percentage of battery remains. I've only heard two unique readouts: 100% and 80%. Its just not accurate. Even weeks after a charge, it will try and say that 100% of charge remains. This feature is just a gimmick and CANNOT be trusted.\n- Volume knob. The volume knob is bad. It takes several turns to notice any adjustments in volume.\n- Range. Range is only about 20-30 ft it seems.\n\nGreat product, will buy from HyperX in the future.",
                "2": "I've been using these headphones for about 7 months now on a daily basis, so here's a quick analysis based on experience.\n\nVery good audio. Compared to audiophile headphones, these are a little muddy and bass heavy, but imo that's ideal for gaming and basic audio needs. From my experience, you're not going to get much better in terms of wireless bluetooth headsets.\n\nI haven't used the mic a ton, but no complaints when I have. I recorded a bit, just to see what I sounded like and it sounded very clear. I love that it's removeable with a very simple 3.5mm jack that feels sturdy.\n\nSpeaking of sturdy, these are definitely sturdy. I've tossed them around and dropped them (off my desk) quite a few times, and no issues or even worries.\n\nBattery life is INSANE. I've gone weeks without charging, and never hit low battery. I don't understand what kind of tech they've discovered, but they need to share it because I've never experienced battery life like this.\n\nRange is very good. I use these on the top floor of a three story townhouse and can go down to the basement without them cutting out. I see complaints about range in other people's posts, which I find strange. Maybe if your range isn't good, you should try an exchange because mine is awesome.\n\nComfortable. I have a pretty big head (7 1/2 hat), and these are still very comfortable and could go even bigger.\n\nMy only complaint is that they turn themselves off after 10 min or so. I'd like to be able to set that for a longer time, especially since the battery lasts forever and a day.",
                "3": "The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless headset has become my go-to for teleworking and gaming. I've been using them for the past few months and have been very impressed with the sound quality, comfort, and wireless reliability.\n\nThe audio is crisp and clear thanks to the dual chamber drivers. The bass has plenty of punch for intense gaming sessions but doesn't overpower the mids and highs, so music and calls still sound great. The earcups feature plush leatherette and memory foam, allowing me to wear them for hours without fatigue.\n\nConnecting wirelessly via the included 2.4GHz USB adapter, I've had no drops or interference even when walking around my apartment. The battery life is excellent, usually lasting me a full workday before needing to recharge. The headset also works wired via the 3.5mm cable for when I need to conserve battery.\n\nFor those seeking an easy-to-use wireless headset that excels at home office and gaming use, I highly recommend the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless. The sound and comfort are top-notch while the reliability has impressed me time and again. It's become my daily driver headset for all scenarios.",
                "4": "I come from a HyperX Cloud II wired headset, because I was in the market looking to upgrade to something a little bit better, whether it be with features or sound or both. Thing was, I loved the solid construction, the passive noise isolation, and the comfort of the Cloud II. But it lacked bass, like it almost had no bass, and because I love bass in the first place, it made listening to music or games always wanting more.\n\n----\n\nI first tried the HyperX Cloud Orbit S headset that was $329, claiming amazing speakers but lacking build quality. When I gave it a whirl, I despised everything of the headset. The audio was worse, the 4 modes were confusing, it did not accept my Dolby Atmos addon, and I felt so bad for spending that money. I instantly returned it after trying a few games and music sessions to confirm my impressions.\n\nThen I discovered the world of wireless headsets. I have never owned a PC/Gaming one, but I kind of realized how annoying my long current wire was. Always tangled, gets stuck in my chair wheels, uncomfortable to manage in some setups (Like flight simulation hardware), and I always had to put the headset down to get some water or snacks or use the restroom. Oh and let's not forget the very annoying times when I would try to stand up but since the wire got caught in the chair, it would rip the 3.5mm jack out of the soundcard on the USB. That pissed me off so many times, it was ridiculous.\n\nThe only reason I never bought into the wireless trend was battery life. My friends have had instances where they needed an extra hour because they realized their headset needed a recharge, and that's yet another factor I don't want to worry about in my life. The last thing you need after a long day of work is to realize your headset ran out of battery and needs some time to charge.\n\nI saw that there claimed to be \"better\" headsets out there in various articles compared to the HyperX Alpha, but two things led me to this headset. Battery life (300 hours?!) and near-identical build to the HyperX Cloud II. It had the same phenomenal leatherette ear muffs, which are not only insanely comfortable and can last you a 10 hour session with no pain, but it also featured a metallic bone structure, which is great because I am tired of having plastic everywhere these days. Once I received the headset, I was really nervous because the previous HyperX model was a huge let down. But I gave these a go with music and some games, pairing it with my Dolby Atmos 3rd party app, since this headset supports 7.1 surround sound. And I am telling ya, this changed my life. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. This felt like a huge QOL update for my life.\n\nFirst off, the bass is exponentially superior to what I had previously. I could actually feel it in my ears, and having an EQ editor in the manufacture's app helped make that possible. Secondly, I still find myself about to take my headset off to get water, only to remember that I don't have a wire to deal with. It's amazing to be able to do the transition wired to wireless (I can imagine how annoying it must be to go the opposite way haha). I have used this headset for around 4 days now, and the battery level has yet to move down from 90%, I don't know how it can even sport a battery like this without gaining significant weight (the weight doesn't pose any issues for me).\nAnother huge benefit was the mic monitoring. I live in a thin-walled apartment, and I noticed myself being so loud when I play games because of that passive noise isolation the headset provides. Using mic monitoring (can be turned on or off) helps me gauge my vocal noise levels, so I can be quieter and a better neighbor, huge win-win. The mic also has a glowy red ring at the root of the pop filter which notifies you if you are muted through the physical mute button. I did not think I would be able to see this from the pictures on the website, but your best friend Peripheral Vision works and you can indeed see it! Another nice feature is a sturdy volume wheel underneath on the right ear piece, as well as only a few buttons (compared to like 5 or 6 I've seen, confusing as ever).\n\nI quickly wanted to mention volume. This headset can get loud yes, but it won't sit at the same loudness level as your wired headsets. For example, my Cloud II sat at 20-22 Windows volume, and that was my comfortable level before getting too loud. This headset's equivalent is closer to low 30's. So I believe the max is lower than your wired headsets, but I tried listening at 100 for a few seconds (for research purposes) and no one should ever do that. That's absolutely damaging noise levels. So for basically everyone out there, the volume should be of no worries :) Keep your ears healthy, and listen quietly!\n\nNow my main complaint, and it will always be my number one complaint with HyperX - the microphone quality. Yes I understand that microphone quality is hard to achieve in headsets. I polled 3 of my friends in Discord, one stated it sounded the same as the Cloud II model, while the other two say it is slightly worse. But this microphone is indeed worse than average. In comparison, two my friends who use a $30 cheap, Chinese headset have far superior quality microphones, meanwhile the sound of mine almost embarrasses me. It's not garbage, but it's not really good either. It's gonna leave you wanting more out of it. Also, lack of Bluetooth and Xbox compatibility kind of does bring the experience down. All 3 reasons are why I gave a 4/5 stars.\n\n----\n\nThis headset is phenomenal, and I will be using this for a least a few years into the future. But with the mic quality, it's gonna make me keep one eye looking elsewhere at times. So it's up to you to decide how large of a role that plays into your purchasing decision. I appriciate your time reading this long, hefty review! I hope I helped answer some of the questions I know I had while browsing. Happy looking!",
                "5": "I really enjoy this headset. It has fantastic sound quality, good battery life, and medium range.\n\nPros: The sound quality, in and out, is great. Battery life is actually as advertised. Simple and easy to use. It blocks out a significant level of outside noise without making my family need to yell for me to hear them. Similarly, it doesn’t pick up much background noise when I speak. Friends on Discord have commented on the improvement. Also, it is plug and play with no software to install (afaik). I like NOT having more background programs, this is a big plus.\n\nCon: the range isn’t great, I can get about 25’ away but it disconnects immediately after taking another step. I wasn’t expecting to be able to hike, but a trip to the kitchen would be nice.\n\nOverall: It’s a great value for the price. It works very well, and has surprisingly long battery life. The relatively short range isn’t a deal breaker for me, but is a real consideration for some users. I think it’s simplicity and ease of use is a very nice feature.",
                "6": "ORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI am a software engineer that works from home. I'm in a lot of meetings throughout the day, and also like to listen to music and watch movies while I work. I need a good wireless headset with long battery life. There isn't a single headset that matches or even comes close to the battery life of this headset. Additionally, the sound quality is AMAZING. Before this headset, I had the Corsair VOID RGB and the sound quality was garbage. This HyperX headset has great highs and lows.\n\n1 MONTH UPDATE:\nI use this 5-6 days/week for at least 8 hours each day. It's been a month and the battery life is still at 100%.\n\n1 MONTH 2 WEEKS UPDATE:\nOkay, now I'm annoyed. I'm having trouble sleeping at night thinking about how is this engineering phenomena even possible and why has this not been implemented in other existing technologies? At least just get me to 90%... As of today, I'm turning my music up to 75% (which is extremely loud in this headset btw).\n\n2 MONTH UPDATE:\nAlright. So it's been two months. The battery indicator guy that states the battery level every time you turn on the headset said \"Battery level is 100%\" this morning. Halfway through the day, the headset shut off while I was listening to music. I thought maybe something fried and the headset is no good anymore. However, after plugging in the headset, it powered back on. Turns out, the power level guy is a damn liar. Literally told me an hour ago that the battery level is 100%, when really it was nearly dead. After plugging it back in, the battery level guy changed his mind and said \"Battery level is low\". I've updated the overall rating to 4 stars because of this. It'd be nice to have any kind of battery level indicator, but the fact it only says 100% deems it a garbage feature. However, the fact that the headset lasted 2 months on a single charge, while using the headset 9 hours a day, 5 days a week is still an amazing feat.\n\n2 MONTHS + 1 DAY:\nThe headset no longer holds a charge. The battery is only good until it needs to be recharged. Read other reviews. This headset lasts about 2 months if you're lucky. If it's under 90 days, you can get a replacement (which will probably just last another 2 months). So basically you get 2 months of wireless headset for $200, then the remainder of it's life must be wired.\n\nI contacted customer support at Amazon, they forwarded me to the wrong place, who then forwarded me to HyperX, who then put me on hold for an hour, who then told me to try plugging it in to a different outlet. After about 30 minutes of me trying to explain that I know how outlets work, they said I need to mail in the headset and the tech will do testing on it. If he can't get it to charge, he will send out a replacement. If he can get it to charge, he will send it back to me. Smh, this is not even worth it. I'll just keep it and use it as a wired headset.",
                "7": "I recently acquired the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless headphones, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every aspect. Primarily used for gaming and various academic pursuits, these headphones have proven to be an indispensable asset. The sound quality is nothing short of phenomenal, offering an immersive audio experience that truly enhances my gaming sessions and aids in focusing during my studies.\n\nOne of the most impressive features has been the battery life. Living up to the manufacturer's claims, these headphones offer a long-lasting performance, ensuring uninterrupted usage for extended periods. This is particularly beneficial during lengthy gaming marathons or when tackling prolonged academic tasks.\n\nMoreover, comfort is paramount with the Cloud Alpha Wireless. Even after hours of continuous wear, I experienced no discomfort, thanks to their ergonomically designed ear cups and headband. This comfort factor is a game changer, especially for someone like me who spends considerable time using headphones.\n\nIn summary, the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless headphones are a stellar combination of high-quality audio, enduring battery life, and exceptional comfort. Whether for gaming or academic use, they deliver a top-notch experience, making them a highly recommended choice for anyone seeking a reliable and high-performing audio solution.",
                "8": "I bought these and immediately started using them 6-10 hours a day without plugging it in. A month later the automated voice tells me the battery is 20%. I finally plug them in to charge and for the past week it has been “The battery level is: 100%”. That alone makes these an amazing pair of headphones. Add to that the amazing sound quality of the playback, and the so-so quality of the mic, these are a solid 5-star product.\n\nPros: Battery lasts a good month of daily 6-10 hour use.\nEar cups are comfortable and do not press in to my glasses, like a lot of other brands, eventually making my ears hurt.\nSound quality is adequate for gaming purposes.\nWireless.\n\nCons: press to power on/off is a tad too long.\nBattery lasts so long I might have trouble finding the charging cable.",
                "9": "I’ve owned and tried a lot of headsets, and I mean ALOT if headsets. And I am confident to say this is number 1. Next to the Corsair HS80 wireless at number 2.\n\nIf you are in the market for a new headset or are trying to find the best, you should buy this headset.\n\nNot only is it comfortable, you can hear very clearly where noises and footsteps are. You have to keep the drivers updated, but it’s very good at hearing directional noise. What’s surprising is that the noise isn’t super loud. I know with a lot of headsets you have to raise the volume to an ear damaging level to hear everything, but this headset is very smooth on the ears.\n\nOther than the noise quality, the most impressive thing about this headset is the battery life. When I saw the amount of time they advertised the battery would last, I had my doubts. I believe it says 300 hours. I will say that this is actually true and it’s insane. I game for a minimum of 3 hours a night and usually can go as long as 6 hours. And let me tell you that even though the headset started at 80% out of the box, it has been an entire month and I have yet to charge it. The headset shows having still 30% battery left, after a month of consistent daily use. It’s great.\n\nA couple other small things that make this headset nice is that when you turn it on, a very smooth sounding voice tells you when it powers on, what the battery life is, when it powers off, and when it disconnects (after powering your computer off or if you walk too far away).\n\nThe distance isn’t great but it’s good enough. It’s probably like 20-30 feet. But it doesn’t bother me. The other qualities of this mic make up for this.\n\nAn interesting fact is that the voice only gives you the battery life in increments of 10. So if the voice tells you that the headset has 50% remaining, then I believe it’s within the range of 50-59%. So in reality I could have gotten my headset out of the box at 89%, I never checked the software, which will give the precise percentage.\n\nI don’t use the mic, I have a HyperX Quadcast for that purpose so I can’t review that part of it.\n\nAll in all, it’s the best mic I’ve ever tried and owned. And I would highly recommend it.\n\nUnless you are a person who likes really sharp and loud noise directional audio, then I’d say go for the Corsair HS80. But for those who want a great quality sound that is smooth on the ears, this is the one.\n\nHope this helps anyone.",
                "10": "This is my first fully wireless headset it was a bit of a steep investment but overall it's been well worth it. I've had a couple issues and some things I didn't realize going into I.\n\nFor starters I've used the wired version of this headset before so I knew what I was getting sound/build quality wise which was great. I didn't realize it wasn't something I'd be able to pair with my phone tho. You can only use it with the USB adapter on connected to your computer. For the most part while this is a mild inconvenience It doesn't affect things much for me.\n\nIt's got a decent range It depends entirely only how many walls or things are in-between you and your computer but I get coverage across most of my apartment. It does have a tendency to disconnect and reconnect a lot even when I'm within range.\n\nI heavily use my headsets basically all day everyday when not at work so having one with a high battery life is incredibly important to me and this is by far better than I could have asked for. I can charge it once every 2-3 weeks depending on use and have zero issues. Even after a year of use the battery life hasn't noticably degraded.\n\nThe ear pads did start to fall apart a couple months ago so I replaced them for a few bucks which wasn't an issue as I'm used to this happening with various other headsets.\n\nMy only major issue with these is the volume control wheel on the headset. I had zero issues using it for the first 8 months or so but it started to give me issues. If I scroll the wheel to turn the volume up it would often go up/down same time and make it hard to adjust it precisely. After about a month or two of this now if I ever touch the volume wheel it's a 50/50 if it increases it slightly or if it just keeps going after a minor touch until it's on max volume. Basically can't lower my volume with it at all anymore or raise it in any reliable manner.\n\nI've had no major issues outside of this but the software that's used with this headset is sub par at best doesn't have enough options to adjust the sound quality or adjust the volume of the headset itself. You can use some other programs to adjust the base volume of the headset (which is noticably lower than some other headsets I've used before)"

Secure dual zips ensure the case won't open while being jostled and the hardy shell will protect from loose keys and cables at your Switch. ",
            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "This is an excellent case for your new Nintendo Switch. I ordered it the day it was put on Amazon for an amazingly low price, so I did not have high expectations, but I am happily surprised at the high quality of this case. The case is hard enough to fully protect your Nintendo Switch, yet flexible enough to fit in bags and carry everywhere with you. The case has nice little rubber handle and zips shut. There is no zipper on the inside of the case.\n\nInside you will find it is lined with a soft microfiber. There is a mesh pocket on the top that goes about 3/4 of the way up and holds a ton of stuff. The bottom of the case has a double sided flap. The top holds 8 cartridges and the bottom is padded to fully protect your Nintendo switch screen. The bottom of the case is form molded to hold your Nintendo Switch perfectly and even has loose fitting elastic on each side to help secure it in place. I originally bought the officially licensed Tough Pouch, but much prefer this one. They are almost identical in size and appear to be made about the same way. The pouch is a fraction thinner and does not have a handle. It has almost the same inside except not as useful. The flap that protects the screen is sewn at the top and does not fully protect the screen on the touch pouch, where this one is on the bottom and fully protects the screen. The Orzly case holds 8 games and accessories and the tough pouch only holds the switch and 5 cartridges. Another thing I love about this case is that it is simple and black. There is no advertising on it anywhere and no way for thieves to know you are carrying an brand new Video Game Console.\n\nPlease see photos for more details and please excuse the crappy screen protector I have on the Switch in these pics. The 5th picture shows the Orzly pouch on top and the Tough Pouch on the bottom for size comparison.\n\nHighlights:\n* Holds 8 cartridges or micro SD cards\n* Large Mesh Pouch can hold all cords, chargers, or an accessory. I even fit 2 entire game cases in the pouch!\n* Large soft screen protector sewn into case.\n* Handle for carrying the case.\n* Lightweight, yet strong and durable.\n* The Soft, microfiber interior protects your console and controllers from everyday wear and tear, bumps and scrapes.\n\nThis case is well worth the $25 it retails for and the case I compared it to is currently selling for $40! Only issue I had was that it was sent in a bubble mailer, so the outside box was crushed. This would be a problem if it were a gift, but it did not affect the actual product in any way.",
                "2": "After spending big bucks on my Granddaughters Nintendo Switch I realized “Holy Cow” I bought nothing to protect it!! She is only 8 and walks around with it and uses it in the car. When I drop my cell phone I am always glad I have a case! I immediately ordered this one and it’s perfect, a safe place for everything and a sturdy handle for on the go! Not expensive and she always uses it!",
                "3": "When I'm spending the weekend out of town, I use a nice, big carrying case the can hold the whole system set up. That's great for a whole weekend, but when I'm going to be stuck someplace boring for an evening or just a few hours, now I can take what I need to stave off boredom without having to carry everything I own. This case is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about breaking anything and roomy enough to hold extra controllers, cords, games, or anything else I can't live without. And it still fits in my purse. Great product!",
                "4": "Overall the product is great. However, one of the complaints I have is that whenever you try to put in the Joy Con Grip in the case, the cause becomes extremely bulky, and it causes me to worry that if ever drop the case that it might crack my switch's screen. Also, obviously you can't put an elite controller in the case which sucks because you either need a separate bag or you have to carry it in your hand. Otherwise the case is EXTREMELY good, the bands that hold the switch is great, the pockets that hold small accessories are amazing (it can hold the charger and extra joy cons), and the zipper & sturdiness of the case is phenomenal. Therefore, I would highly recommend getting this case even if it is on the pricier side.",
                "5": "This carrier for the Nintendo Switch is really nice. It holds everything it needs and honestly, the quality is great. For as many times as this thing gets opened, the zipper appears to be holding strong. I'm happy with this purchase.",
                "6": "Fits switch perfectly and it’s accessories. Good, sturdy case",
                "7": "I wanted something I could bring my switch with me on travel, Just drop it in my bag and forget about it. So far I've used this case on a couple of trips and it's been great. It's not too bulky, but it does its job well. Plenty of room to store a charger or whatever you would like.",
                "8": "This case is durable and holds my switch plus a variety of different games and other msc items.",
                "9": "Love using this case for traveling with my switch. It can hold many games as well. Strongly recommend if you’re looking to get a traveling case for your switch!!",

God of War Ragnarök is not just a game; it's an immersive masterpiece that leaves you in awe from start to finish.\n\nKratos and Atreus return with a vengeance, and their character development is nothing short of breathtaking. The depth of their relationship and the complexity of their personalities make this game feel like an emotional rollercoaster. You'll laugh, cry, and cheer for them on this epic quest.\n\nThe graphics? Mind-blowing. The PS5 truly flexes its muscles here, delivering breathtaking landscapes, intricate character designs, and jaw-dropping battles that make you feel like you're right there in the midst of it all.\n\nGameplay is flawless. The combat system is as satisfying as ever, with Kratos wielding his Leviathan Axe and Atreus providing invaluable support with his arrows and abilities. The variety of enemies and bosses keeps you on your toes, constantly adapting your strategy.\n\nThe storytelling is top-notch. The plot weaves seamlessly through Norse mythology, introducing iconic characters and gods in a way that feels fresh and exciting. Every encounter feels like a piece of a grand puzzle, pushing you closer to the climax.\n\nAnd let's talk about the sound design. The music is hauntingly beautiful, adding emotional depth to every scene. The voice acting is superb, immersing you in the world and the characters' struggles.\n\nIn sum, God of War Ragnarök is not just a game; it's an experience. It's a testament to the power of storytelling in gaming, a visual spectacle, and a triumph of character development. If you own a PS5, this game is an absolute must-play. It's a journey you won't soon forget.",

                "2": "UPDATE 09/30/2023 - I did install Microsoft's Xbox software for PC to update the controller to the latest firmware, but that did not help with the disconnects. What did work is my PC has a motherboard with an Intel chip set (ASRock Z790 Steel Legend WiFi) and that includes the Blue Tooth chip. I went to Intel's web site and downloaded the latest Blue Tooth driver and BOOM - no more disconnects. I now have over a week and many hours gaming with the controller with no disconnects what so ever. The issue was never the controller, but with the Blue Tooth driver on the PC. The Intel driver version that fixed my issue was version: \"Intel Corporation - Bluetooth - 22.240.0.2\" and was installed on 09/21/2023. PC operating System is Windows 11 Pro. This Xbox controller review is now 5 stars...!\n\nIf you are looking for a WIRELESS Xbox controller that disconnects every 10 or 15 minutes, this is your guy !!! Absolutely horrendous blue tooth connectivity. And now I know why they supply a USB cable. Why pay for wireless if you have no choice but to use the supplied USB cable..? And the Blue Tooth on my brand new PC works with every other Blue Tooth device I have with no issues. Just read the other reviews of this item and see how many people have many disconnects during game play.",

                "6": "First I would like to let all my open source friends know that this controller works really well in Linux out of the box, but only with a cable. It's difficult to make it work wireless for some reason. Just don't install the xbox driver and use the default one that comes with the OS.\n\nNow, about the controller itself. The controller is solid, heafty and seems to be a good quality. Buttons and triggers are sensitive and are overall quite nice and give a satisfying feedback when pressed (just the buttons and upper triggers, lower triggers don't have feedback).\n\nHowever, for me there is a big issue with this controller - it feels quite unnatural to hold for me, even after playing with it for 20+ hours. The main issue is that with the natural grip on this gamepad the fingers lay on the lower triggers and to press the upper triggers, the fingers have to be bent in an unnatural way. I also find the location of the left joystick to be not as natural as the right joystick, but I got used to it relatively quickly. Overall I think I prefer the PS controller layout more, but this is also a pretty solid controller.\n\nAnother thing that I don't like as much, is the vibration on this gamepad. This is not a problem per se, but the vibration is just too strong even if it turned all the way to a minimum without actually disabling it. It seems that this controller have some kind of really powerfull rotors installed and it keeps taking me out of the game because it's so strong. But I expect that this is probably something that many people will like, so I am just pointing it out.",
                "7": "(original 1-star review from january 2021) Was shipped in retail packaging, so contents of the package were exposed during the shipping process. Package was also clearly previously opened and resealed, as noted by the usb-c cable not being clipped by a plastic strip, and controller was dusty, basically the same issues that most of the recent reviewers have had.\n\nThe controller functions as a brand new controller, but beware, you'll be paying full MSRP for a controller that most likely was touched by other hands, returned, and repackaged, which is unacceptable, but honestly not worth disputing at this point.\n\nEDIT 07/13/22: Despite the controller possibly being used or refurbished, been using it for more than a year now and functionality has been pretty much flawless. Usb-c port has also held up well. It’s been a long time since I’ve written this review, and within the last week or so, I’ve ordered two more. I’m happy to say that these two have been packaged new as originally expected.",

                "10": "good deal! works great! easy to use! i bought it to use on my laptop and it’s perfect.",
                "11": "I rate this controller a 4/5, it has really good materials and build quality. I just don't like how lightweight it feels, sort of like a kiddy toy. The shoulder triggers have no backstop, so pushing them down your fingers are prone to sliding off unless you hold them. Also, the joysticks feel a little flimsy.\n\nBottom line, good controller and good quality, but lacking in heft and trigger backstops."

                "4": "Just like previous WarioWare games in the series it has everything you would expect. A cute simplistic cartoon artstyle. Humor that's crude and weird. Voice acting sounds great. This is the first entry where Wario is voiced by \"Kevin Afghani\" instead of Charles Martinet's portrayal. It sounds fine but long time fans will catch on very quickly. The entire roaster of characters have a vacation summertime theme. It's interesting to see what crazy antics they get into. The Story mode lasts for about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Move It has tons of variety modes for multiplayer. The biggest highlight is of course the fast paced mini games referred to as \"microgames.\" This feels like a sequel to Smooth Moves from the Wii. To play it you need both joy cons with wrist straps attached but also you have to physically stand up moving your body in different poses called \"forms\" in order to win the microgames. Difficulty is medium paced. If you get a game over you'll get a second chance at getting back into the microgames instead of starting over from the beginning. Sometimes you might experience input delays. If that happens make sure the joy cons have the latest update installed from the Switch's settings. Overall WarioWare Move It is a fun party romp that can be enjoyed by everybody. 4/5 stars! Highly recommended.",
                "5": "Really reminds me of smooth moves on the wii! Great party game and I like that in story there are coop minigames. For story, you need 4 joycons (2 sets) and 2 players are the max. However, party mode allows for 4 players, each using one joycon. It really is a lot of fun seeing your friends and family move around like a wacky-wailing-inflatable-tube-man while the ridiculous rapid fire mini games leave no room for boredom. Better imo than Get It Together, though that game was fun in its own right.",

As for the multiplayer titles, they seem to be a huge highlight for Move It! Some minigames are quite innovative and found most of them to be entertaining!

                "1": "1 - AMBIDEXTROUS. First of all, I want to say thank you Logitech for making this ambidextrous to the point it is optimal for left handed use. Thanks to a physical condition, I can only use mouses left handed. There is very few options for people who can only use mouses left handed for gaming, and times are looking grim due to recent news regarding left handed mices. Thankfully, ambidextrous designs exist, and I can easily say that this is THE BEST mouse for left handed users, even better than my previous mouse. I hope to see ambidextrous designs continue down the line, and also bonus points for allowing brief customization that allows it to be a left-handed mice.\n\n2 - PERFORMANCE. Anyways, I've been using this mouse for almost three months now. Its quite clear that I'm more than satisfied with this mouse, and its not just because its ambidextrous. The wireless performance for this mouse has been on point. I've yet to catch mouse lag. Granted, its only been a few months, but it has shown an equivalence of wired mice performance. At first I was skeptical, but not only has this mice proven to me that its as good as wired mices, it has also made wired mices feel like an annoyance to the point where I don't think I could go back to wired mices. Its hard for something to get in the way thanks to how open the mice is, on top of it being pretty damn light. Using this mice is a breeze. So yeah, this mice is on point on wireless performance, and takes advantage of the benefits of wireless mices.\n\n3 - BATTERY LIFE. I will flat out say that the battery life is as good as said. One of the obvious flaws of wireless mices is that they need to be charged. Thankfully, depending on lighting settings, it can last for quite a long time, to the point I forget this mice even needs to be charged. With my current setting, it can last over 60 hours. Logitech has done an amazing job minimizing the flaws of wireless in this mouse.\n\n4 - DURABILITY. Its only been a few months since I've used this. Although I've yet to get my mouse into a breaking point, I've developed a bad habit of hitting the side of my keyboard with the top end of my mouse. Despite doing it at times I don't even notice even scratches on the mice. So far, its holding although I've only used this for just a few months.\n\n5 - FLAWS?. If there is anything I don't really like about this mice, its the awkward setup. More specifically the end of the cable having a claw-like design. It seemed weird at first, but its as basic as it can get.\n\n6 - FINAL THOUGHTS. At first I was somewhat afraid due to the mouse size and the price. My hand is 21x11 cm, and so far I found this mice comfortable. As for price, even though it is $150, I was willing to pay premium just for a good mice for left-handed use. It accommodates for me, it was an upgrade for me, and I am more than happy with this mice alone. There were also comments regarding left and right click overlapping, but that was not the case for my mouse, and this was more of an issue for older G Pro Wireless mices. Wasn't an issue for me which I got in October.\n\nOverall, I personally LOVE this mice. Amazing wireless performance on top of maximizing the benefits and does its best minimizing the flaws of wireless. The ambidextrous design is phenomenal and a dream as a left-handed user. if I could rate it higher than 5/5, I would. Thank you, Logitech.",
                "2": "I am a die hard Logitech fan when it comes to peripherals, been using a mice, keyboards, and headsets from them for years now. I was a very big fan of the g403 and bought a few wired ones as well one wireless. I broke most of them as I used to rage but was especially a fan of the wireless, Logitech knows how to do wireless. I always kept the weight in the mouse so I am more used to heavier mice. Because of this I was somewhat nervous to try a lighter mouse, I wanted to try the superlight but I read reviews of more problems with that one, and with the price tag and larger jump in weight difference I thought the regular G pro wireless was the right choice. When I first got it took a bit of getting used to because I would put more effort into my flicks because I was used to more weight, but it didn't take long.\n\nThe build quality is very good as always with Logitech in my experience, I have had no issues with ghosting, double clicks etc. The ergonomics are similar to the g403 but different on the sides. The stock sliders are pretty good and I don't think I personally need to change them, although I am not that picky when it comes to that. The scroll wheel has a bit more feedback than the g403 which is good because that mouse had almost none. The mouse buttons are more clicky, lighter and feel more responsive than the g403. The side buttons are smaller but also more clicky, but also stick out more than those on the g403 which makes it easier to engage. The logo is a customizable LED which you can change or turn in the G Hub (great app btw), the scroll wheel no longer is. The sensor is much more precise than the prodigy sensor that I am used to, which was still good, but not close to this one. It also has a larger DPI range than before, which I don't use but its cool I guess. It does not have a DPI switch button on the top anymore, but has one on the bottom, which again I do not use as I have always had it disabled, but is nice to have if I need it. You can also charge this mouse wirelessly via mousepad or some other setup, and can add a weight if you desire to do so. I was very surprised at the battery life on this thing. It was good on my previous wireless mouse but this thing only needs to be charged every week at the most for me. When you turn it on out of rest mode it has LED dots that tell you generally how charged the battery is, but you can also check the G Hub app or it will tell you when it is getting low as a little pop up at the bottom right of your screen. It came with a charging cable that was unbraided so I just used my old g403 braided charging cable as it still fits the micro-usb port. It will not come out when charging and playing and will not change the responsiveness which is really good for wireless. I keep mine on my bungie for quick access and so that I don't notice the wire when using the mouse. This mouse is also ambidextrous so leftys can also use it by swapping out the buttons on the side as it comes setup for right handed users.\n\nLogitech is really ahead of the game and has sort of set themselves apart from the competition in the recent years when it comes to wireless gaming, there is not any lag or delay and it is just as responsive as a wired mouse. Wireless is the future and I'm all for it. This is by no means the cheapest mouse, I got it on a deal and still spent a good amount. But it is great for the money, and definitely a competitive gaming mouse that will give you an edge. I think it's great and Logitech has never let me down, so if you're interested in it, and are willing to spend the money on it I say you should go for it and you won't be let down.",
                "3": "I have been using this mouse for almost two weeks and am very glad I made the purchase. My previous mouse was the Logitec G502 Hero, which is also a phenomenal mouse. The G502 Hero is a much cheaper alternative, but it is wired. The G502 Lightspeed has the same great sensor, but it has a few more buttons and is just a little heavier.\n\nThat being said, there was a small break-in period for me while using the mouse. For the first few days, it felt too uncontrollable. You'd be surprised how much of an impact a wire will cause on your mouse's feel. The drag of the wire being gone was alone a big thing to get used to. This mouse is also lighter which added to the feeling. After a week of daily usage, it feels MUCH better, even better than my last mouse.\n\nThis mouse also has fewer buttons than the G502, but sometimes less is more! It has the primary buttons you need for FPS games.\n\nPROS:\n- Easy setup. Just install Logitech G Hub for customization.\n- Great battery life with very quick charging.\n- Great for large hands using claw grip.\n\nCONS:\n- Price\n- Fewer buttons than G502 but you won't miss them after the break-in period\n- Small break-in period if moving from heavier mice.\n\nOverall solid mouse. 10/10 overall, but only getting a 4 star in the Ergonomic category since the stock pads are not as good as aftermarket alternatives, but they are still very usable.",
                "4": "*UPDATE* I received my new mouse and have had zero issues for a while now. Incredible mouse. I have to say I'm incredibly satisfied this thing goes as long as it does without requiring a charge up. If you can avoid the defects, this mouse can only be improved upon by an ergonomic choice by the players.\n\nThat is to say, if you want something more from this mouse, it would be your subjective taste in how a mouse feels in your hands that would affect your selection. Hand size, grip style, and posture will be the biggest determinant. If you like ambidextrous ergonomics or palm grip, this is about as sublime as it gets for snappy flicks. Very stable tracking for continuous movement of the mouse as you maneuver around an angle. Great responsiveness, but I do feel that \"break-in\" time with this mouse is longer than most that I owned. I can pick up most mouses and after a few days of DM be completely comfortable with a mouse. This one took weeks, but it rewards you with a really good sensation.\n\nIt's how I imagine it feels when a runner finds the right running shoe. Maybe a better comparison is upgrading to a better headset. You can \"tell\" this one is different and somehow better, it just doesn't feel comfortable in the same way a new leather shoe is a little stiff when you're breaking them in. If you can afford to try this mouse, get it.\n\n----Old Review----\n\nI honestly wished I was 1 of the 65% of people who purchase these mice and had zero issues with it. The first three days of using this mouse were sublime. I'm a competitive Counter-Strike player. Which means I'm very opinionated about my computer accessories. I have the 240 Hz Monitor, the loud clacky mechanical keyboard, and mousepad that covers half my table. I also happen to have roughly ten different e-sports mice. For me, I tend to go through them rather quickly. I buy them to see if the newer ones have better sensors and to experience the \"hand feel\" of the mouse. If they don't make me happy, it tends to sit in my drawer for the occasional LAN party when the console plebs want to experience the beautiful game.\n\nThe problem with this mouse is very minute but like any papercut. Papercuts tend to chip away at your sanity until you explode in a fit of rage at this minor inconvenience. This mouse double clicks. That is LITERALLY the only issue with it.\n\nNow, I understand this sounds a little crazy. However, you need to realize that this is a review created from a series of hilarious coincidences that have convinced me that my mouse is cursed. I don't care if a regular mouse double-clicked. I am quite certain if this mouse was in my office at work. I wouldn't care. Yeah, it pauses the video right when you click to play them. It mysteriously resizes windows when you're trying to move them. Those are minor inconveniences.\n\nHowever, I have never been so thoroughly trolled by a mouse in my life when it comes to Counter-Strike. It has rendered me absolutely useless with grenades. Counter-Strike has these things called executes. Which usually requires the entire team of players to synchronize grenade throws to surprise the other side with our cool use of grenades. I am often accused of purposely losing rounds because of this mouse. I cannot seem to hold a grenade in my avatar's hand before I immediately throw it at where ever I happen to look. Which in some cases are the backs of my teammates or an entrance we have to run through.\n\nSo what are the benefits? I'm far more accurate with this mouse. This mouse is incredibly precise. You can repeat the same motion of flicking the mouse a certain distance, and you will always turn at that radius. It gives a very snappy response, and there's no strange \"glide\" feeling like a razer mouse. It should be like this for an esports mouse, especially for shooters. However, the fact this is a wireless mouse, and I can't emphasize this enough, the fact I can't tell the difference from this mouse and Zowie mice is remarkable.\n\nI have avoided wireless mice for a long time due to issues with lag and inconsistency in my mechanics while using one. The higher the refresh rate of your monitor, delay in wireless mice is magnified. So consistency is essential for me. I never once thought, the reason I lost an aim duel was due to this mouse. It never failed to do its job. It felt natural. Remember I have ten mice I could switch back at any moment. I didn't even want to consider going back. That's how good it felt to use this thing.\n\nI'm going to take my chances with replacing the current mouse and pray I don't have another one with this issue. If I don't have any further issues, I will update this review.",

                "6": "So lets get this out of the way, why not 5 stars. The only reason I'm not giving this mouse 5 stars is because the profile/settings are not stored on the hardware itself. Logitech software must be running for RGB profile as well as resolution setting. The mouse has a default RGB setting and DPI. This is my first wireless mouse, so maybe that is the reason? My previous wired mice Razer and Corsair brand seemed to keep their profile.\n\nCharging:\n\nI don't have the charging mat to go with this mouse, but I don't find it a hassle to charge. Pretty convenient using the cable they provide which the USB dongle can attach to. I try to swap them out once a week just to make sure it always has a charge.\n\nHand-feel:\n\nI have fairly large hands (6'2\" is my height), the size was a little concerning for me as I've always purchased large mice. I like it though, it weighs next to nothing, especially compared to the last few mice I've used. The only other minor gripe I have with this mouse is that I tend to have my pinky on the ground when I play. There are times when I flick right (I'm right handed) and the fat on my pinky goes under the mouse bringing up the right edge of the mouse off the table. The mouse basically must have full contact to operate and I have noticed at times, not just flicking, but panic tracking, that the mouse is non-responsive because it is just a few MMs off the table. I've been trying to adjust how I hold the mouse which always alleviates the issue, and I could probably benefit from better mouse-posture anyway, so I can't really consider this in my star-rating.\n\nSoftware:\n\nIMO Razer has the absolute best software for my needs. The Logitech software seems good, I'll need more time and play more variety of games to really see if it checks all the boxes for me though. I've been fairly casual since I got this mouse, Ark Survival Evolved, Rust, Icarus, Among Us, pretty much all things that only require default functionality, no MMO play yet.\n\nRandom thoughts:\n\nWhat happened to the day when we'd add weights to our mice? I think part of it is the popularity of quick-action shooters such as Valorant. You can't flick with a boulder. I purchased this mouse because I really like the game Rust, a popular Rust streamer, spoonkid, plugged this mouse during one of his streams and I wanted to check it out. I tell you what, I went from a rock on the beach to AK in half the time with this mouse. j/k I still suck at Rust, but that's on me.",
                "7": "Let me start off by saying that this mouse is absolutely FANTASTIC! I have been using it for nearly a week now and have already fallen in love. Before this mouse, I used a Hyperx pulsefire haste, which is around 60 grams and is pretty good, but It started acting up only after a year of ownership. This mouse weights about 20 grams more but doesn't feel like it, the weight is balanced so well that it feels like an ultra-lightweight mouse, and the battery life is incredible especially if you turn off the RGB (you can do this in the Logitech G Hub software). I'm predicting around 7-10 days of use, using it around 8 hours a day. The build quality is pretty good and the mouse is extremely comfortable, the scroll wheel is tactile while also not feeling \"crunchy\" and the buttons all feel top tier. The tracking is also exceptional and I have not experienced any issues with the sensor. There are 5 DPI settings by default, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and 6400 which can be swapped by using the button on the bottom of the mouse. You can make your own profile in the Logitech G Hbu software and set your DPI anywhere between 100 and 25600. You can also change the polling rate in this software, the 4 options are 1000, 500, 250, and 125 hz. I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone who is in the market for an extremely comfortable, well-balanced, and reliable mouse.",
                "8": "Logitech has done an outstanding job manufacturing a wireless competitive gaming mouse. I personally will never be sold on the idea of a wireless mouse being better than a wired one just because of signal interference alone, this does not detract from the fact that this mouse is indeed a dam good mouse even for fast pace FPS shooters. I will try to go in order writing my review of this mouse from opening to playing with it.\n\n*Packaging*\n\nFor a $150 mouse I expected more from the packaging however I do understand that maybe Logitech wanted to keep things simple. There is no wow factor here just a simple small box wrapped in plastic. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn't be able to tell this thing costs$150.\n\n*Opening*\n\nSo once I got into the box that looks as though the contents of it didn't cost $150, I was once again taken aback. Reason being that the mouse was just sitting there unwrapped. The reason this kinda surprised me was because I had to make sure that I didn't accidentally order a used mouse. Nothing against used electronics but I generally stay away from them because they could potentially have unseen underlying issues, however Amazon and their generous return policy has restored some of my confidence in buying them but I did not want to go that route with this mouse at this price point. The mouse did have tape on the underside once I lifted it from its cradle but again I did double check to make sure that it wasn't a used product. I removed the tape from the underside and checked the mouse skates for any signs of scratches and everything was cool.\n\n*Package Contents*\n\nThe package contained what you'd expect. The mouse, a wireless dongle, and a cord all wrapped and in good condition. One thing that concerned me that I wasn't sure about was whether or not the buttons on the right side of the mouse were preinstalled and to my relief they weren't. The reason I say this is because I prefer not to disassemble my electronics if I don't have to, if you have to then you gotta do what you gotta do but I work in maintenance and repeatedly taking something apart and putting it back together causes excessive wear and damage and I'd prefer keeping my $150 mouse in pristine condition other than normal wear and tear.\n\n*The Mouse*\n\nThe mouse itself felt great, it felt solid and sound. The shell was sturdy I'm a heavy handed individual and I was comfortable applying normal pressures from my hands to the mouse with fear or it being damaged or broken. The mouse slides gracefully across the mouse pad out of the box so you won't encounter issues there, I would've preferred they used the mouse skates Razer has been using on their largest mice but it is what it is I ordered some Hyperglides to replace them.\n\n*Installation*\n\nSo the mouse is plug & play, I already had G Hub installed and the software recognized the hardware no problem. I didn't have to update any firmware or anything so that was cool I just plugged the dongle into the computer and turned the mouse on from the bottom and it was good to go.\n\n*The feels*\n\nSo I have large hands and going into this I expected it to be small for my hands and I was correct. I use somewhat of a palm claw hybrid and I found that I had some empty space between my hand and the mouse itself which is kinda like a dead zone and could cause slop when making fast movements. Like I said I anticipated this going in so I can't say I'm disappointed. The side buttons are nice as well as far as where they are positioned and how they feel when you press them, they're very responsive. My only gripe would really be to move them back a little but I attribute that to the size of the mouse itself if the mouse was a little larger they'd naturally be further back. The button position in relation to the size of the mouse is fine and about where you'd expect them to be. The two main mouse buttons feel pretty good as well the clicks sound good and feel equally as good I had no double click issues or indications thereof. One thing to really look out for are people buying this product used from someone else who had the double click issue and sending it back then someone else buys the mouse again with the same problem and all of a sudden a lot of people end up sharing the same mouse with the same issue leaving the same review complaining about the same problem. I've encountered no double click issue so far. The weight of the mouse itself is great as well it feels really balanced not too light but not too heavy.\n\n*Tracking*\n\nSo this is where the rubber meets the road, I wanted to test just how good this mouse is and if it's as good as they say it is. I tried this thing out not in Microsoft word or nothing like that I went straight to Apex Legends and COD. I went into G Hub to check my configurations and much to my surprise I didn't have to do anything another good thing about G Hub is that your settings apply universally to all Logitech mice so because I had profiles set up for one mouse they assumed it'd be the same for this one so that was a good surprise. The mouse tracked very well I have to admit I was impressed for a wireless mouse that didn't fit my hands that well I performed amicably and even was champion a few games and I'm not one to argue with results. The mouse tracked even my most minute movements without skipping a beat.\n\n*Conclusion*\n\nI was on the fence about even picking up a wireless mouse because I wasn't sure if the technology was really ready for competitive gaming but it has come a long way. My only real issue with wireless is the batteries, no matter how good the battery may be eventually it will wear out and turn your wireless mouse back into a wired one Logitech could circumvent this by making the battery removable but they'd sell less mice in doing so. Which leads me to the reason I chose Logitech over Razer because I've had to trash a wireless mouse once already in the past granted the technology back then isn't what it was today. I'll hold on to the mouse because I like it and it performs it will be the one in the arsenal. I've attached some photos of the mouse alongside some more other popular mice in the game for size comparison. Enjoy.",
                "9": "So I have small hands, and I came from the wired Razer Viper Mini because I wanted to go wireless to get rid of the cable drag sensation. The G Pro compared to the Viper Mini is heavier and bigger, so it was hard to handle initially, but I eventually got used to it. If you have bigger hands or are used to using bigger mice, this will be great for you - you won't have to go through an adjustment period. I think for my next upgrade I'll go for the G Pro X Superlight. I'm a lower sens FPS player so the lighter the better, but I'd still recommend the G Pro for competitive FPS gaming if you want a higher end gaming mouse, but don't wanna break the bank too much.",
                "10": "I recently purchased a mouse with high hopes for a seamless computing experience, but unfortunately, it has a notable flaw—periodic disconnections. The mouse itself is comfortable to use, with a sleek design and responsive buttons, but the intermittent disconnects proved to be a significant inconvenience during work and gaming sessions.\n\nOn a positive note, the customer support team was exceptionally helpful and responsive when I reached out about the issue. They promptly acknowledged the problem, guided me through troubleshooting steps, and eventually facilitated a replacement. Their efficiency and commitment to resolving the issue left a positive impression.\n\nWhile the periodic disconnections were a frustration, the positive customer support experience salvaged my overall satisfaction with the product. If the connectivity issue is addressed in future versions, this mouse could be a top contender in the market. For now, it's a decent choice with the caveat of occasional disruptions, mitigated by the reliable support team's efforts to make things right."

So if you are from the US, although the disc will work, any DLCs will not work since the DLCs are region locked and are directly associated with your PS account (assuming you have a US account). I learned this through working with the Warner Brother's Support and they were unable to provide me with a functional code for the Haunted Hogsmeade quest and shop that was supposed to be for the PS console. So the PS exclusive DLC could not be downloaded even though the game plays fine. If Hogwarts Legacy released any future DLC's (like maybe quidditch) I wouldn't be able to access them unless I picked up a US version of the game.",

                "1": "Super Mario Odyssey is the return to (mostly) everyone's favorite sand-box style of playing Mario. This game has you going around in many unique worlds, running around freely as you did in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The fans asked and Nintendo delivered. Mario is finally back and he's here to save the 3D platforming genre. With that being said, hold onto your fedoras, because we're jumping right into the review. Also, I will try to be as spoiler free as I can.\n\nStory: For the 800th time, our job is to help Mario rescue his (girlfriend?) Princess Peach from the evil clutches of Bowser. Only this time, Bowser is forcing Peach into marriage.\n\nControls (basic): Mario's running speed is is between Super Mario Sunshine's and Galaxy's. I think this speed is perfect, allowing for the appropriate reaction time. A plethora of Mario's athletic tricks are back such as the triple jump and somersault. I have to point out how much easier it is to perform the triple jump in this game. The window between the jumps have been lengthened, so casual gamers will enjoy this. They've also added a few new jumping techniques such as the ground pound jump that gives you an extra boost in height once you flatten an enemy with your bum. The diving and long jump also make a return from Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario 64. HOWEVER, long-time fans may be displeased to find out they're somewhat nerfed. For example, the long jump is much shorter than it was in 64 and the dive doesn't allow you to continuously slide like it did in Sunshine. But, down frown yet. They've brought back the rolling technique from Mario 3D World that allows you to continuously roll by tapping the button. It's perfect for traversing large areas. Next, I gotta tackle the swimming controls You tap the button to float up and release to float down (similar to super mario sunshine, but no longer clunky). Pressing the ZL and Y buttons together will let you zoom straight for a second, but it always doesn't register for some reason. You often accidentally ground pound, which is frustrating when you're running out of air or racing for a moon. I prefer the Mario 64 swimming controls.\n\nControls (Cappy): I have to devote a whole section of this review to the Cappy controls because they have such an influence on the game experience. Throw Cappy with Y and this little guy can manipulate all kinds of enemies and objects. Holding Y will make Cappy spin in place, allowing for a chance to do some hat-jump techniques. These techniques make the game so much more fun to play. Advanced players will have fun throwing cappy over gaps, long jumping over to him, bouncing off of him and diving to the other side. There are a bunch of more tricks you can do, so I hope you'll try to perform them. When you throw Cappy at an enemy, you posses- I mean, capture them and can make their abilities yours. This allows for a bunch of unique playstyles and Nintendo did a splendid job incorporating them into the game.\n\nMotion Controls :I know people are tired of hearing us complain about motion controls in Nintendo games, but part of being a reviewer is being critical. I found the motion controls to be pretty unresponsive most of the time when playing with a Pro Controller. Trying to do a downward throw with Cappy almost never works and jerking the whole controller to the right for a spin move isn't comfortable nor functional all of the time. Keep in mind motion controls ARE NOT REQUIRED to complete the game. However, some of Mario's moves are locked behind them. For example, there's no button mapping for throwing Cappy upward/downward. But, they could've used the L or R buttons easily. For example, L+Y+up could've been a combination for throwing Cappy skyward. Also, there are instances where shaking the whole controller/tablet makes you jump/climb faster, which isn't a big deal. But why not hold the Y button or something to speed up, ya know?\n\nObjective of the game: Odyssey is a collect-a-thon game. You travel to different areas and collect Power Moons, which allow you to travel to even more places and so on. Note this game is not mission based like the other 3D Marios. When you collect a moon, you don't get booted out of the level. It's more in the line of Banjo Kazooie. There's a big world and you're free to run around until you get enough moons, then you go to the next kingdom. Each Kingdom has generally 20 or more moons. Note that there is post game content that increases the number of moons available to collect. Here's the critical part. Some moons require a little elbow grease to get, but a lot are just thrown right in your face and take only 10-30 seconds to get, which alleviates the sense of accomplishment the other 3D Mario's had. This may not be a big deal to newcomers, but as a long-time Mario fan, I had to point it out.\n\nScale of the game: Unlike Super Mario 64 and Sunshine, Odyssey DOES NOT have a hub-world. You select kingdoms in a world-map kind of style. The game consists of 15 Kingdoms. A handful of which are disappointingly small in comparison to others. For example, 2 kingdoms mostly serve as the arena for their respective boss battles and some Kingdoms consist mostly of linear areas with barely any open areas to explore. There are 4 kingdoms (in my opinion) that are the appropriate size. if the other kingdoms could be the size of these 4, then I'd be much more pleased with the game. Despite what I've said, there is a point in the game where you go back and collect more moons from every kingdom, which adds to their content.\n\nDifficulty: I'm a Mario veteran and I completely understand that Ninty wants this game to be accessible for all ages. But, it's pretty upsetting to me how much easier they made this game compared to the other 3D Mario games and I'm not even talking about the \"assist mode\", which was literally put in the game for younger kids. I'm talking about the regular mode. One big change is the removal of lives, which honestly isn't even the reason I'm mad. Game Overs are more of an inconvenience than anything because in cases like Super Mario Galaxy or what have you, the game just kicks you to the title screen and your progress is saved. However, in the case of Super Mario Odyssey, the game is a cakewalk even without game overs. You'll almost never die from losing heart points because collecting moons will instantly refill them (moons are literally everywhere btw) and not only that, there are Heart point expansions in every kingdom that you can buy with coins. The Bosses are just plain disappointing, as well. Some are clever, but having the same strategy repeated 3 times is just getting old. Note that there is post-game content that offers a better challenge, but we should be able to change the difficulty at will.\n\nGame length/replay value: The main campaign length is pretty short. It's very much possible to finish the story by getting the minimum required moons and zooming through each kingdom, which takes about 7 hours (for an experienced player such as myself). BUT, that's not how the game is meant to be enjoyed. \"Replay\" is this game's middle name. Once you finish the story, even more moons and areas open up. These moons offer a harder challenge, as I mentioned earlier. Not only that, the kingdoms you've already visited get harder challenges. I've been playing this game for over a month and can confirm there's a truck load of things to do. I'm looking to 100% this game and I'm just a little over halfway there. You won't believe how many moons they stuffed in this game.\n\nTo conclude, this game is a must-have for the Switch regardless of the flaws I've listed. It's chock-full of content and is still one of the best games on the system. Easily worth 60 bucks. But, get it cheaper if you can. This game is built around both casuals and experienced gamers. So, if you've never played a Mario game before, you will probably have a better experience than me since everything will be a surprise. And to veterans, there are still gonna be surprises that'll make your jaw drop. Plus, the references to past Mario games will make you smile and remember the good old times when we didn't have to work and pay bills. Anyway, thanks for reading and happy gaming.",
                "2": "**The following review is rather in-depth, and longer than the average amazon review. I tried to keeps spoilers minimal. Just an FYI, now onto the review.**\n\nSuper Mario Odyssey is the best reason to go out and buy a Nintendo Switch right now. It is, hands down, one of the best Mario games ever made, and one of the best 3-D Platformers I have ever played. Even after you “beat” the game, there is so much more to do. The game manages to recapture the old, sandbox style 3-D Platformer that we saw in Super Mario 64, Sunshine, and games like Banjo Kazooie. Odyssey manages to update and modernize the concept, and tweak it to near perfection. No doubt about it, Odyssey is a must own. With that to say, I hope you enjoy my review for this incredible game!\n\nStory: Story has never been a Mario game’s strong suit. Odyssey isn’t too different. The game opens-up with Mario fighting Bowser, a fight which Mario loses. Bowser then kidnaps princess Peach yet again, only this time he also captures Peach’s sentient hat, known as “Tiara,” and plans a wedding for him and Peach. Mario meets a sentient hat named Cappy. Cappy is able to take control of, and poses different creatures and objects (Mario meets the exorcist.) Mario and Cappy use an air-ship called the “Odyssey” in order to trot the globe in a quest to sabotage Bowser and Peach’s sinister wedding. The story is very bare-bones, but it gets the ball rolling; once the ball rolls, it doesn’t stop.\n\nPresentation:\n\nSuper Mario Odyssey is truly a feast for the eyes. Every kingdom you go to is a wonder to look at, from the cascade kingdom with its prehistoric look, to the Hispanic style sand kingdom with its “Day of the Dead,” themed aesthetic, to the snow kingdom, the wooded kingdom and it’s sentient gardening tools, the luncheon kingdom (yumm,) and especially the New York inspired Metro Kingdom. Each kingdom that Mario visits looks incredible, and has a unique visual style. The texture and lighting design are also extremely impressive, the frame-rate is very solid.\n\nThe music is outstanding. There is great variety in musical styles, and the game features many instrumental themes. You’ll hear very ambient sound effects in one stage, songs befitting of a beach in other stages, and even a folk-style song in the wooded kingdom. One kingdom has a Japanese palace inspired musical score; the music can get quite epic towards the last few kingdoms in the game, similar to the Super Mario Galaxy games. The game even features songs with actual singing, such as the surprisingly catchy “Jump Up Super star,” which you hear during a celebration in “New Donk City.” The sound effects also perfectly blended with the controls, and the gameplay. The menu is also very slick, and the Switch functionality allows you to pause the game and jump right back into it at any time. Presentation wise, this game is a winner through and through.\n\nGameplay: Controls for Super Mario Odyssey are fantastic, and very intuitive. The controls for Mario are similar too how they have been in previous 3-D Mario adventures. Simply running around as Mario, and jumping is so much fun. My favorite new mechanic is the ability for Mario to roll like a ball, which is especially fun in the sandy and hilly areas. While some have had issues with them, I have found the joy-con motion controls to be precise and very fun. The camera in this game is much better than in previous titles, but it still has its occasional issues in certain areas. These issues are few and far between, however. The controls are all in all very responsive and as fun as ever.\n\nCompared to recent Mario games, Odyssey has a much more open-ended, sand-box design to it. As was mentioned earlier, you travel to different kingdoms such as the Cascade, Sand, Forest, Snow, Metro, Beach, Forest, and other kingdoms in order to chase down Bowser and his new lackeys, the “Broodal Bruddas, (bunny like creatures.”) Each kingdom has its own residents, and even interesting world-building aspects that flesh them out. For example, the luncheon kingdom has living utensils, while the snow kingdom has polar bears. The sea-side kingdom has snails, while the Metro Kingdom has actual people. These unique aspects make every kingdom exciting and interesting in its own way. The main gameplay itself consists of exploring these kingdoms, and searching for Power Moons (think the stars in Mario 64/Galaxy, or the jiggies in Banjo Kazooie,) in order to power up the Odyssey ship and travel to the next kingdom. You acquire said moons by exploring every nook and cranny in the kingdom, solving little puzzles, fighting bosses, doing menial tasks, participating in minigames, and more. Some of the power moons are scripted, particularly early on, but most of them are not. For a game with such an open-ended nature, there is tons of variety to the gameplay. You might be controlling a T-Rex one moment, riding a golden lion another moment, balancing on a giant corn-cob, or even riding a motorcycle through the streets of New Donk City. The variety is stunning, and keeps the gameplay from getting boring.\n\nThe real gameplay hook for this Mario adventure is the ability to use Mario’s hat to control, and possess different objects, creatures, and even some people. It may seem a little weird and creepy at first, but the execution is ingenious, in a way only Nintendo can pull off. You can literally take control of several Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Hammer Bros, Fire Balls, Tanks, Frogs, and even a T-rex. You can even take control of certain inanimate objects, and even some of the humans in New Donk City. This switches up the Gameplay almost infinitely, but in a way that always feels very organic, introducing so many unique and clever moments that never cease to be fun. Just goofing off and experimenting with this mechanic is half the fun in and of itself.\n\nThe boss fights, many of which incorporate the possession mechanic, are all very fun and well designed. The end-game fight in particular is a high point among the impressive array of boss fights that the game has to offer. One of the most surprising boss fights you will encounter is a dragon that looks like it’s straight out of Game of Thrones. While a few of the bosses are challenging, many of the fights feel rather easy, and are a breeze to defeat. Some of this is due to the fact that there is no longer a “game over,” as you simply loose coins when you die. The boss fights are still tons of fun all around. Speaking of coins, you can use them to purchase different outfits, power stars, and other goodies. Some of these outfits have some actual gameplay use, but many of them feel like window dressing, though it helps spruce up your ship none-the-less.\n\nWhat is so incredible about this game is that after the credits, you feel like you have only just begun. The replay value for this Mario game is absurdly high, and the possibilities open-up a ton after you finish the story, which should take you around fifteen hours in and of itself. The gameplay is also perfectly suited for being able to play in small doses if you have a job and a busy schedule (as I do,) but you can also play to your heart's content when you wish to, on the weekends in my case. The Gameplay really is about as close to perfect as you could hope for a 3-D Platformer to be!\n\nVerdict: Super Mario Odyssey is a celebration of more than thirty years of Super Mario. The game encapsulates what Mario has always been about: Pure fun. More than that, though, the game innovates and surprises long after you “beat” it. I certainly see myself playing this game for several more weeks to come. This game is the number one reason to purchase a Nintendo Switch if you have not done so already (They’re still hard to find.) This game truly is the best 3-D Platformer I have played in years, even giving Galaxy 2 a run for its money; it is one of the very best games that our favorite Italian plumber has ever been in. So go out, buy this game, and participate in an incredible, one-of-a-kind, globe-trotting “Odyssey.”\n\nCons:\nEasy initial difficulty\nOccasional camera issues\nSub-par plot\n\nPros:\nBeautiful visuals and design\nAmazing music\nGreat sound effects\nTight and responsive controls\nWonderful Sand-Box style Mario Gameplay\nIncredible and ingenious level design and scenarios\nQuirky and fun characters\nTons of variety\nUnbelievably high replay-value\nOne of the best Mario games ever made\n\nOverall: 10/10\nPeace, Dana",
                "3": "Mario Odessey is easily the most hyped Mario since Mario 64. Unlike some, I refected on my opinion and changed with time. Now I've beaten every major Mario release excluding the Galaxy games. My first introduction to Mario is my earliest memory. Xmas 85 my step grandfather won a NES at a party a couple days before that they got from the original Nintendo test launch. Every adult was jumping while distracted by a scrolling thing. It was so odd how excited they were. Mario World brought graphics and multiple buttons for the best controls at the time. Mario 64 rewrote 3d gaming, acing 3d platforming on its first go and changing how we looked at 3d games. For Odessey I ignored all gameplay and trailers after the E3 presentation as to go in fresh. I judge this as a Mario game so I'm extra critical. So does it live up to the hype?\nAlmost... Gameplay first and it is snappy. The games features dynamic resolution to achieve 60 frames per second. In the PC community there is a saying,\"Give me 60 or give me death.\" It makes the game control easier, panning the camera and motion is smooth. This makes controlling Mario top notch. Never did I die and think it was the games fault. In fact the input timing at 60fps is so good, going to xenoblade 2 or BotW makes them feel delayed in comparison. The new hat mechanic is an interesting new twist, but at the cost of power ups. Which I did miss. It is fun controlling the enemies, and each have different capabilities to help progress and find moons. Eh the moons. The single laziest thing in the game. There are hundreds of them but you only need a fraction of that to beat the main game and you can buy moons. Yes you can buy moons if you can't get to 600+ on your own. So it's easy to get them and it turns into a collection thing. Collect golden coins, stage coins, moons to collect more stuff. Though I did enjoy getting many of the moons for their challenge they could be replaced with a lot of coins considering I can just buy them. The hat can also whip around using motion to beat lower enemies. It's all well polished, but the motion feels odd at best. The 2d parts are fun but very short. There were moments where I thought this was well thought out or this is really cool, but never did I say WOW! How did they do that?\nFor the game itself. There are coins that you can spend on a shop or death. There are stage coins that buy fitting stage outfits as well as decorations which are useless. Just more busy work. You are trying to save Peach again. Three hit bosses. Very typical. The stages are short. Like not any larger than some Mario 64 stages and there are not that many stages either. The t rex can only be used in a very limited section. This is the main problem of the whole game. Where the fun factor is high, it only lasts 15-20 hours max then you just get moments from then on. I beat the game in under 10hours, and I was exploring. Even the collecting busy work took me 30 hours to get enough to go to the real last stage. Botw lasted me 100 of hours of new exploration. This is padding pure and simple. Level design though small is well polished with a lot of secrets. The level design is the best of any platformers ever but it really really could have used a larger open area to each stage.\nGraphics are just decent. Look a lot of compromises have been made to achieve 60fps. Mario and npcs look good, as well as locations, but textures and draw distances are poor. Pop in is really bad and the stages are smaller than you would think. Art style can only hide so much.\nSound is excellent. There is no voice acting, but the music and sound effects are stellar.\nSo is Odessey a good Mario game? Yes, however it feels very restrained and easy. That is until the real last stage where it gets very unforgiving to the point it doesn't fit with the rest of the game. In fact with that exception, I think this is accually the easiest Mario yet and gimicky. My kids will have no problem playing this, but even glossing over that. I can't let some nostalgia moments make me forget how short this is and small the \"worlds\" feel.. This is not the best game ever, not a chance, it's not even the best Mario it just tries to remind us of them. Mario3/World are probably the best givend their eras. But it's good. Really good. Like an instant classic and better than Sunshine or anyother modern Mario good. I liked using enemies powers, but it doesn't carry an entire game. It would have been great to get a flying power or jump on Yoshi. Costumes are a cute idea and thank the stars amiibo are not needed. After BotW this might be the second best game of the year. That said it's a fairly distant 2nd for me. But trounced Horizon or anything else. I can't see a bunch of adults excited to play this like the first game. Nor is it mind blowing like Mario 64. Its not revolutionary. Even Cappy kind of mimics Kirby. It's an easy buy, replay value is good and its a perfect platformer. Simply the best 3d platformer. I just wish there where more of it.",
                "4": "I have not had this much fun with a Mario game since Mario 64 on the Nintendo 64 system when it came out back in the days. Hands down the best, most true-to-character Mario game in recent history. This is the essence of what a platform game should be and Nintendo should be proud of themselves for taking their beloved franchise to new levels. Green Mushrooms for all!\n\nHonestly, I grew up playing Nintendo. The NES started video gaming for me. And I owned every nintendo system outside of handhelds and the Wii U. However, during my late teens and early 20's, I shifted into playing more \"hardcore\" games on systems like PS2, PS3, PS4, etc.etc. Initially I owned a Wii, but hardly spent any time with it. Basically, I have been out of the Mario scene for some time. The Switch changed that for me.\n\nMario Odyssey rules. Here is the general gist of what this game is all about:\n\nBowser steals Peach (like always) and wants to force her to marry him (like always). Peach has a little animated princess crown companion that just happens to be the heartthrob of Mario's animated hat companion, Cappy. Of course, Mario gotta get his girl back and Cappy is more than happy to oblige helping Mario do this by way of providing Mario new skills. Motivated to help Mario acheive his goals, Cappy brings a new dimension of play in multiple ways.\n\nMario's mission is to travel between different themed worlds in his quest to chase down Bowser. Marios does this aboard a glorified hot air baloon that is powered by a resourced called Moons. Each world has a plethora of moons; some in plain view, some tied to \"quests\" and a WHOLE BUNCH that are hidden behind secret walls, portals, mini games, etc. Collect enough Moons on each world and it unlocks travel to the next world. So on and so forth till you catch up to Bowser.\n\nCappy brings a bunch of new mechanics to Odyssey beyond just being a nifty weapon to use against baddies. Cappy allows you to use elements in the environment to \"possess\" things that allow you to get around each unique world Mario visits. Sometimes you can possess switches that propel you along walls like a rubber band. Other times you can possess power lines and travel as a ball of lightning to different areas. And sometimes you can use Cappy to open doors into challenges that you have to complete hatless and without his help. These can be especially challenging and really give you an appreciation for what Cappy can do for you. The old addage \"you can never truly appreciate something until its gone\" really rings your bell during these challenges.\n\nThe idea of Cappy being this chameleon companion that can also possess certain types of enemies is pretty cool. I have always wondered what it would be like to be a dreaded goomba (many a killer of Mario) or a fireball-spitting venus fly trap. There is quite a feeling of gratitude when you can finally turn your enemy's weapons against them! For so long I HATED getting fireballed or eaten by those dang venus fly traps popping out of pipes!!!\n\nThere are also some new enemies for Mario to deal with, as well, and they play an important role in Mario's new adventure. The true GENIUS of this enemy-possessing ability is making it part of the puzzle. The enemies you possess become integral to unlocking secrets and progressing through each world. In fact, you cannot progress without this mechanic.\n\nWhether its possessing fish in an underwater tunnel to keep Mario from drowning or using Cappy's Exorcist-style mind control on a frying pan flinging turtleshell so you can destroy giant blocks of cheese YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! The ridiculous level of fun never ends.\n\nOutside of using Cappy for all the cool above-mentioned things, the platform experience is truly on point. This IS a Mario game, afterall. Nintendo has even managed to fit in a nice little throwback to the early Mario days via pipes spread out across the different worlds that teleport you to an old-school version of Mario in bit-style graphics armed with only your jump button. Truly retro. Oh, and to top it off, you transform into your 8-bit version WITH your current costume on.\n\nOh, did I forget costumes?? Yes indeed. You can change Mario's outfit to personalize his looks and to also unlock secret areas that require you to be dressed a certain way.\n\nThe only wish I have for this game is some of the worlds are rather short lived experiences and I wish there was more content. Also, you are forced to travel in a linear fashion from world-to-world even when the road \"forks\" and you are given a choice which one you want to visit first. Even though it would seem like there is a \"progression\" going on, each world is disjointed and theres no real overall \"theme\" to the game other than collecting Moons and chasing Bowser. I never felt like any one world was \"easier\" than the other; there are just different and surprising mechanics going on in each world. This makes each one feel really unique and whimsical, but doesnt lend itself to a cohesive story. The boss fights also become redundant and predictable after a while.\n\nWhile there are a lot of extra Moons you can squeeze out of each world, and you are free to travel between already unlocked worlds, I dont see a lot of replayability in this game other than being a \"completionist\" and really digging to get every list completed. Dont let that detract you from playing, however. This game will constantly surprise you!\n\nHats off to Nintendo (yes I punned you there) for bringing me back to Mario land. Buy this game NOW!",
                "5": "This game is an open world Mario game similar to Mario 64 and Mario Sunshine giving you a lot of freedom to explore.\n\nThere is so much to do: so many side objectives and collectables within viewing distance that it's sometimes overwhelming at first since it's hard to stay on objective with teasers keeping you off the beaten path. With that said, this game is filled with content and let's you progress at your own pace. If you rush through the main campaign it will last you around 10 hours, which opens up even more levels and collectables via post game content. To do everything it can last 100s of hours if you explore on your own without any online guides/tips. There are coin collectables you can use to purchase new clothes for Mario or cosmetics for you ship. Collectables feels more like rewards for discovery rather than a collect-a-thon, and at no point does it feel that the game is hand-holding you through it with it's natural progression system.\n\nLove the visuals with its amazing vistas in full HD, especially on TV mode. There's a lot of personality in the characters as the emote very well via animated body movement or facial expressions. You can snapshot the game at anytime and see Mario's various reactions\n\nWriting/dialogue is very good, or at least whimsical as there are fun micro stories among characters within levels. Main plot is generic, but you don't play a Mario game for the story (except for the Mario RPG series). Bowser captures Peach and tries to wed her, but wants to collect all the best gifts from different kingdoms. You play as Mario and try to stop the forced wedding from happening.\n\nMusic is also very good, including orchestral music along with some having vocals . I like how the music complements what you're doing and where you are. For instance if you reach the peak of a high tower, the music cuts off and all you hear the wind blowing.\n\nNo power ups, but with your pal cappy able to take control of any enemy Captain Ginyu style (Dragon Ball Z reference). All enemies feel vastly different from each other from attacking to solving puzzles/collecting out of reach items. There are 50 to collect/capture .\nPower moons main collectables in the game (883 Total), which powers your ship to travel to new kingdoms/worlds. There's a nice enycopedia/log of time stamped moons you collected and where you obtained them via check mark on the map screen. Love the map design as it's displayed like an amusement park pamphlet with description of landmarks/attractions. There's also a fast travel feature when you reach a flag checkpoint, as you can warp between them.\n\nThere are also region exclusive currency (purple coins) to collect, which unlocks costumes for that specific region you collected the coins in.\nMario controls more fluid than ever before, especially with his new momentum based roll, and ability to do toss and springboard off cappy\nNo 1up system. When you die you lose 10 coins and respawn instantly. Coins are valuable as they can be used to purchase game tips for 50 coins each, costumes/cosmetics that can be upwards to 1,000 coins each, moons for 100 coins each, among other things\nMotion controls. Some shaking is involved, but it's very minimal and only required in a few levels/mini-games. Feels odd shaking the whole system in handheld mode though\n\nThere's co-op where one player controls Mario and the other Cappy. This is not a full fledged co-op affair as the person who plays cappy has a similar experience as moving the cursor around in Mario Galaxy.\n\n2D segments are pretty neat with Mario changing into his 8 or 16bit counterpart attached to the wall around a 3D backdrop.\nTons of mini-games to be had; some utilizing the cap capture mechanic as well as traditional Mario platforming. There's also an online leadboard for how may times Mario can jump rope.\n\nBoss battles are very creative as they're a fun puzzle in itself, using a hat transformation you used through the entire level to defeat the boss.\n\nAmiibo. There are wedding Mario, Bowser and Peach Amiibo which unlocks costumes and help you find moons. These costumes are not locked via these amiibo, and can be purchased via in-game coins\n\nOverall, most fun a had playing video games in a while. Get ready for a fun filled adventure",
                "6": "Just finished the game. I liked it. Had some fine highlights. I don't think I'll be replaying it again for a while. I don't care about getting all the moons. The ending was fine. Nice touch of feminism there.\n\nFrom the online posts, lots of people are saying this is better than Breath of the Wild. Hmm I don't think so. It's more colorful than Breath of the Wild. I'll give it that. And it is more enjoyable to explore the open worlds of Super Mario Odyssey than BOTW Hyrule, because you dont have to worry about a camouflaged octorok popping out of nowhere pelleting you with rocks.\n\nBut as far as Super Mario Odyssey goes, it's pretty good. There's a lot of fluff and presentation. It gives homage to the history of Mario. Sometime you're playing a 3d game, then it will revert back to a retro 2d platformer. There are some fantastic moments. Such as when you're playing ARMS against bowser. There's also the jazz scene in New Donk City, the DK throwback sequence.\n\nAnd there's some good gameplay too. This is the most complicated mario yet. He has a moveset from a fighting game, with lots of different jumps, rolls, and combos. You have to execute the right button presses to get to all the areas. But that's not a far cry from what we had to do in the first mario games. You did have to press the right buttons at the right time to traverse the world of obstacles and pit falls. Yet this game also has the option of being simple as you can select assist mode, if you are having difficulty. So the youngest of all kids can play and have fun. That's how the first Mario game got me on the NES. I was a kid and it was a lot of fun and now I'm a \"physically\" a grown man and Im still playing Mario.\n\nAs I was playing, at times, I felt like I was playing a Disney Infinity toybox level, which is not a compliment. The desert level feels like this especially. It feels like the developers put a boring desert map, then they put in a smattering of points to visit, and that's it. When you're at Point A it's interesting, when you're at Point B it's interesting, but when you're going from Point A to Point B, it's not interesting. It's pretty uninspired. It's not tied in together well, is what I'm saying. It's a mixed bag. Some worlds are great. Some not so much.\n\nThe motion controls are pretty good. you can shake your joy cons around and it lets you throw your hat better. there's also at least one boss battle, where you can use the motion controls as you would in ARMS, and punch bowser. which is so so satisfying. I really really love motion controls. It really makes it immersive.\n\nI like the amiibo integration as well. It lets you get different costumes, which is fun. And you can use them mid game, you potentially restore your hearts.\n\nWell I think that's about all I can say about the game. It's a good one I feel. Worth buying. Now that I beat the game, I wouldn't mind trading it in for another game. There is a post game, i.e. collecting all the moons. but meh. don't really feel like doing that.",
                "7": "Good game, not perfect.\n\nWhat I like:\nI really enjoy finding all of the fun little easter eggs scattered everywhere and anywhere throughout the vast array of kingdoms Mario can explore.\nThe new mechanic of Mario throwing his cap and capturing enemies to gain their powers is a nice little addition to Mario. I am a big fan of Kirby, and it doesn't seem like we're going to get an open world Kirby game for Switch, at least not soon. So this is kind of a nice compromise. Mario with a just a hint of Kirby. Turning into a T-Rex is just as fun as the trailers made it look.\nAlthough there isn't as much to be seen from your old favorites like the Shy Guys, Koopas, etc. I really enjoy some of the new NPC's. I especially like the skeleton heads (Dia de Los Muertos) type characters in Toastarena and the Robots of the Wooded Kingdom. Some of the great iconic moments of this game include these NPCs, like finding yourself in a secret room rocking out on your guitar with them.\nThe two player is really interesting. At first glance, having one player control Mario, and the other control Cappy seems like you'd have some much watered down gameplay, but that isn't necessarily the case. Cappy is able to move around freely as your player 2 and can jump and explore and even ground pound like Mario. To be honest, if anything, Mario feels a little crippled in the 2 player without being able to freely use Cappy. However, this is made up for somewhat by the fact that some new jumping possibilities exist when you play cooperatively with your player 2 controlling Cappy. It emphasizes that Cappy is a living being and an integral part of the story, but I still miss Luigi... I mean as a little brother it was demoralizing to have to play as Luigi...now little bros get to be a hat...\n\nWhat I dislike:\nEarlier, I applauded the plethora of Easter Eggs. They are a blessing and a curse. They are very different games, but Odyssey will continue to inevitably draw comparisons to Breath of the Wild. While the Easter Eggs in Breath of the Wild made the journey that much more exciting and full-bodied, the Easter Eggs in Odyssey seem like they ARE mostly the objective. The story line is fairly weak so far, so the game makers had to compensate for that by adding a seemingly endless number of collectibles. Every stage is formulaic. Bowser took whatever random wedding thing, you have to get it back...blah blah.\nAside from that, the power moons feel really inconsistent. You sometimes get them for just ground pounding a sand dune, but sometimes you have to spend a half hour and a dozen deaths swearing at your TV in order to obtain these glittery lunar prizes.\nThe motion controls are really annoying. I know lots of people have said it, but it needs to be mentioned. The game is mostly playable without getting too crazy with your motion controls, but more than a few times, I've found myself losing HP or even dying because I couldn't get Cappy to do what I wanted. There are very few ways in which they enhance gameplay, like shaking the controller upside down to climb faster...but that really just feels unnecessary. There are a lot of people who swear by the motion controls on other games like Splatoon 2, and I accept that. Just offer gameplay that is equally as robust without them. There are puzzles and secret areas that are essentially impossible without motion controls so the game's statement that motion controls aren't necessary is false.\nAnother gripe that I have is that there is an endless amount of new costumes and combinations to play with, but they are essentially just skins. All costumes do the same thing and do not affect game play in any way that I've seen so far. That's somewhat disappointing, and I think it's a missed opportunity to add some more depth to the gameplay.\n\nOverall, I think the game is really solid, but not perfect. It has some of the innovative gameplay of Mario 64, some of the charm of Paper Mario, and a bit of a twist in the mechanics like Sunshine, but honestly, it doesn't do any of those things quite as well which is why I gave it 4 stars. Anybody rating the game lower than a 3 is probably a troll. Despite its shortcomings, it's still a really great solid game that will give you lots of hours of exciting gameplay.\n\nEdit: having completed the game (current moon total 505), I can say this game is really a triumph for Mario. Nothing has changed from what I wrote above but some of the post game and final worlds really sold me. The game gets beautifully nostalgic at the end. You won't regret buying it.",
                "8": "Super Mario Odyssey is a game that someone can play for hours on end without even feeling like time has passed, so many scenes will give you child-like flashbacks, remembering older games like 64 and galaxy, while still being completely original. While playing, no matter what age you will feel like a child playing this game, from its excellent narration to its stellar gameplay. This game had me in a trance from start to finish",

                "1": "I have been using this for a couple of weeks now, and it is a very very lovely little thing. I get the urge to just go and tack away at it because it is so satisfying to use the keys.\nThe .2mm actuation takes some getting used to, but provides a very prompt response to whatever you need to do in game, just be weary of accidentally hitting another key, but that gets better with practice. The on-the-fly adjustability of actuation makes switching from a game to writing an essay very quick.\nThe cable it comes with is very robust, and long enough for any normal setup, and the connection is very stable.\nMy big disappointment with this purchase is the LED issues. After about 10 seconds the LEDs just freeze for like 3 seconds, making any dynamic lighting unusable, but they are still very pretty when static. I assume this is a software bug that should get patched with time, but as updates roll around on Prism, nothing gets fixed.\nThis falls just short of \"you get what you pay for\" as of now, but if the LED issues were fixed, this would be money I have zero regrets spending.",

                "4": " I saw a bunch of hype for the Wooting 60HE all over the internet and was very interested in the features it had, but despise 60% keyboards. I saw that SteelSeries updated their pro keyboards to have the exact same functionality of the Wooting, but also had full and tkl versions. I saw many reviews on the internet saying the software of the steelseries was its main downfall, but imo the software works just fine. Very easy to understand and never fails me. I also replaced the keycaps with the white steelseries pudding caps to make it look that much better, but the default keycaps are still very nice. The sound while typing is pleasant as well, better than I expected when comparing to youtube reviews. I originally bought a refurbished version and it actually sounded incredible, it almost sounded modded to me but idk why it sounded like a custom keyboard. I highly recommend the refurbished version tbh. But the new one was cheaper on prime day so I figured a better warranty and completely new keyboard for less money was a better deal. But if you're choosing between this and the wooting, I'd 100% choose this. I don't see one scenario the wooting wins honestly.",
                "5": "I bought this keyboard to replace my Logitech RGB G910, which I had purchased in 2017 for $130. That was a great gaming keyboard, but for typing it wasn't very good at all. So I figured I was due for an upgrade and after a bit of research, settled on the SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL 2023. So far, I am very impressed at how the keyboard handles both gaming and regular typing workloads. The keys are ultra sensitive (key sensitivity can be modified) and responsive which makes typing very fast and accurate, especially compared to my previous G910 which was infamous for requiring heavy keystrokes. The Apex Pro TKL 2023 by comparison needs far lighter keystrokes.\n\nGaming wise I would also give the edge to the Apex Pro, though it's not necessarily a fair comparison as the Logitech is a much older keyboard but since that is my point of reference I will go with it. Another thing I love about this keyboard compared to my old Logitech G910 is that it comes with a decent assortment of preloaded RGB color profiles. This means I don't have to install SteelSeries software unless I really want to change to a custom profile. The G910 by comparison had only one preloaded RGB profile and as far as I know, you had to have the Logitech software running to be able to set a custom profile.\n\nThese manufacturers do that because they want you to download their software so they can further pull you into their ecosystem, which is why they limit the amount of customization you can do without the software. SteelSeries is no different in that regard, but at least they have a lot more stock profiles to choose from.\n\nAnyway, all in all a great keyboard that can multifunction for gaming and regular workloads and highly recommended.",
                "6": "My son loves SteelSeries products and this keyboard is on his Christmas list this year. I caught it on sale and couldn't be happier. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he realizes he is getting the newer updated one versus one he has now. His old one has down very well. He is a gamer and homeschooler, so it gets used to the max. His keys on his old one are beginning to not respond, so this new one is coming at the perfect time. I have no worries this keyboard will be awesome too.",
                "7": "TLDR: the keyboards battery and charging software causes this product to barely functions, and after just 2 months of non-intensive daily use the product fully stopped functioning.\n\nI like the keyboard it feels good, the keys have a nice soft bounce the arm rest is really comfortable. The largest problem is that the keyboard does not function. Simply sneezing withing 300ft of this keyboard will drop the battery life from 90% to 5%. It does not charge well and if it does charge the battery will only last for a week fully plugged into a computer 24/7, at which point you have to magically wait and SOMETIMES it will charge up to 100% for you to use it for 25 min and it already be at 50%. Something is wrong with this product and I am not the only person who has been having this issue. really disappointed in the product and will not be buying from steelseries again.",
                "8": "If you are like me and looking at this board, you may be getting frustrated at how hard it is to find that nearly perfect board that should exist, when you're willing to drop over $230.\n\nPros:\n- Omnipoint switches work as advertised -- if you like super fast response time, you can't beat these. These switches also have excellent bounce and no ping.\n- PBT keycaps are nice, and switch cross-stems are compatible with a lot of after-market keycaps. Overall a solid thock.\n- Unlike other small wireless boards (ahem Logitech G915 TKL...), this has no rattle\n- Very light and quite compact even among TKLs, makes for a good portable board in a TKL case.\n- The volume wheel is very satisfying.\n\nCons:\n- Firmware issues, firmware issues all around. There are some updates available, but even with it, the battery indicator is botched. My first piece would refuse to charge (as far as I could tell) until it was nearly drained. The second unit charged, but the battery indicator would be all over the place based on what was going on, ranging from 30% to 80% within a 4 minute span! Which is accurate? Who knows.\n- Also, the battery life kinda sucks. Typically lost over 50% charge with moderate LED lighting in 5-6 hours of use with an aggressive sleep timer set. Other boards lose barely 15% with this amount of usage.\n- The keyboard doesn't wake up very fast, and it doesn't register the keypress you used to wake it up. Leads to missed keystrokes often, especially if you set a low sleep timeout to conserve battery.\n- The only Caps lock indicator is the LED color of the key becomes white (which tbh is kinda blue, see below) when active. This is really hard to see quickly, and there is no option to use the superfluous OLED screen for this. Overall the OLED screen would have been better used for lock or battery indicator lights. This is kind of a big QoL issue for me that could be easily resolved with OLED firmware.\n- LEDs are kinda off. Blues are too strong, reds very weak, and have heard of folks having issues with LEDs dying, with no easy repairability.\n- Despite how nice the switches are, they don't feel as good as gasket-mounted/dampened switches. The spacebar is a huge offender, with no stabilizers it is jarringly louder than every other key, but is one pressed quite often so it makes you sound like a really bad drummer. It's hard to not compare this board to others at this price point that sound way better (see: ROG Azoth).\n- The USB-C 2.4Ghz transmitter is quite chonky as far as transmitters go these days (again, see ROG Azoth). This makes it project a good bit from your computer, making for a prime cable-snagger. On top of that you likely need a USB-A adapter or extension cable, which is one more component that is a failure point, takes up space and hampers portability. There's also no dock in the keyboard for them (which they could have easily accommodated) for portability.\n\nThe cons list outnumbers the pros by just a little bit much for a $200+ keyboard, hence why I returned it. Ultimately the ASUS ROG Azoth was the first and only $200+ board to check the features I wanted while having fewer cons than pros. Still, the Apex Pro TKL is a clear second, with some advantages that might tip the scales in its favor if those are more important to you.",
                "9": "Let me start off by saying that I'm a professional gamer. I'm so professional, I put the \"pro\" in \"procrastination.\" And let me tell you, the SteelSeries Pro TKL 2023 keyboard is the perfect keyboard for anyone who wants to take their procrastination to the next level.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the design. It's sleek, it's sexy, it's...oh who am I kidding, it's a keyboard. But it's a damn good keyboard. The keys are so responsive, you'll feel like you're typing on clouds. And the tenkeyless design means you'll have more space on your desk for important things, like a picture of your cat or a half-eaten bag of chips.\n\nBut what really sets this keyboard apart is the RGB lighting. I mean, who needs a social life when you can have a keyboard that lights up in 16.8 million different colors? You can even customize the lighting for each key, so you can make your WASD keys look like a rainbow, or your F1-F12 keys look like a disco ball. It's like a party on your desk, and you're the only one invited.\n\nAnd if you're worried about accidentally spilling your Mountain Dew on this bad boy, don't be. The SteelSeries Pro TKL 2023 is spill-resistant, so you can spill as much Mountain Dew as you want (just don't tell your dentist).\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a keyboard that's both practical and flashy, look no further than the SteelSeries Pro TKL 2023. It's perfect for procrastinators, gamers, and anyone who wants to add a little pizzazz to their workspace. And who knows, maybe it'll even make you a better gamer. Or at least a better procrastinator.",
                "10": "Very high quality product. Bought it for the extreme actuation speed. Evidently this is best used by pro gamers because I kept typing the wrong keys by accident since it was so sensitive.",
                "11": "**Pros:**\n1. **Performance:** The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL with the new 'rapid trigger' feature is a game-changer. The difference in games like Valorant is very noticeable.\n2. **Customizability:** While the out-of-the-box sound and feel may not be exceptional, it's easy to mod the keyboard. Adding foam or doing a tape mod made the typing feel and sound better.\n3. **Great Value:** Compared to Wooting keyboards with analog switches / rapid trigger, this one offers better value for your money. Plus, it's more reliably in stock, so you don't have to wait forever to get your hands on it.\n4. **Lighting:** The RGB lighting on this keyboard is very vibrant.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. **Keycaps Could Be Better:** The included keycaps aren't top-notch, but they're easy to swap out for better ones.\n2. **Clunky Software:** The software for customizing the keyboard can be a bit clunky.",
                "12": "As with any gaming keyboard, this is easily overpriced by like 50 bucks. However, I will say that among the gaming keyboards that are out there, this one really feels good to type on. I absolutely adore the customization options that come with the key switch.\n\nThe magnetic wrist rest felt good at first, but started to creak as I kept using it. The keyboard itself's build quality felt quite good, so I was a little disappointed and surprised to see that the same level of attention and care wasn't given to the wrist rest. It's very annoying to hear the creak and even worse to feel my wrist sinking into the magnetic wrist rest ever so slightly every time I use it."

                "1": "I've been playing video games for decades - I was in high school when SF2 and Final Fight were the kings of arcades. I've played the original TMNT arcade game, the NES games, the SNES game, and, well, a ton of other beat-em-ups during my tenure. For me, TMNT: Shredder's Revenge stands out as an absolute gem - without any doubt, the best beat-em-up I've ever played.\n\nThe pacing is perfect, the speed is amazing. Your characters are fast, powerful, and can combo like nobody's business. Levels are beautifully designed, and I can't say enough about the amazing retro soundtrack. At the price it's going for, it's an absolute steal. There are tons of throwbacks to the earlier games (\"Big Apple, 3 PM\") and enough fan service to please even the most skeptical fans. In short, if you haven't played it yet, you're missing out",

                "4": "As soon the game started, it seems that I started going down memory lane because the story line and graphics are very familiar. Wow, I know I had a ton of fun at the arcade when I played this game, it’s incredible that I bought this game without realizing. Spending my tokens was fun but now I’m definitely going to pass down to my future kids.",
                "5": "I’m old enough to have played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the arcades as well as the sequel, Turtles in Time. I’d always play with a friend and have fond memories of the experience. I’ve seen multiple reviewers claim that Shredder’s Revenge is the greatest side scrolling beat ‘em up of all time. The question is whether or not side scrolling beat ‘em ups are even worth it on the home console in this day and age.\n\nWhen I first played this game, it was online with a friend and someone else at the house and we had a blast. It brought back all those old feelings of nostalgia playing in the arcades. It’s definitely an advancement over the arcade version in terms of graphics but still has a very retro feel and it’s not pushing the capabilities of the Switch. After awhile I asked my buddy over the phone how many levels there were and he told me 16. That is a LONG game for a beat ‘em up and I was starting to get tired. Finally, we finished off Shredder and the closing credits ran. At this point I’m faced with the same problem I have with other beat ‘em ups. Now what?\n\nIn the 80’s and 90’s, beat ‘em ups were ubiquitous because they were basically cutting edge. We would simply play the same levels over and over again. My friend and I played Story mode a few days later but it’s 90% the same as Arcade mode. I unlocked Casey Jones and that was pretty much it. It’s basically the same feeling I had with Streets of Rage 4 although SoR4 had more unlockables. I’ve put about 2 or 3 hours into Shredder’s Revenge, and I really don’t have a burning desire to jump into it again. There are tons of achievements, but I really don’t like playing for achievements rather than the sheer fun of playing.\n\nI think I have to just face facts that what I loved when I was younger just doesn’t really appeal to me anymore. It’s the same with Shoot ‘em up games. I used to play them all the time when I was a kid and might still toss in a quarter or two at the arcade, but they are extremely shallow for a home experience. They are fun for maybe one or two run throughs but then you’ve seen pretty much everything. There are many games on the Switch that I’ve put 40 or more hours into as compared to a few hours on a Beat ‘em up or Shoot ‘em up.\n\nI think Shredder’s Revenge would have been better if there were a handful of unlockable characters rather than one and maybe some branching in the arcade mode. I might literally avoid playing arcade mode because I don’t feel like slogging through 16 levels in one sitting with a friend. If the game had branching, it could have the same levels or more but not be so long on a single playthrough. The gameplay was fine but nothing spectacular. I wouldn’t put it above SoR4 or a game like Fight ‘N Rage. I figure this game will get set aside and every once in a while I may pop it in and play a little bit with a friend online. Not sure if that was worth $35 for me.",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "Using the Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 during my streaming sessions brings me an incredible sense of control and efficiency. Being able to trigger actions with a single press of a macro key is not only satisfying but also saves me precious time. It allows me to focus more on engaging with my audience and delivering high-quality content.\n\nThe seamless integration with popular apps and software like OBS, Twitch, and YouTube enhances my streaming experience and enables me to create a polished and professional-looking stream. I can easily switch scenes, adjust audio levels, and execute various commands without interrupting the flow of my content.\n\nThe versatility of the Stream Deck MK.2 is truly impressive. It adapts to my needs and preferences, allowing me to create custom profiles for different streaming situations. Whether I'm streaming games, hosting a live Q&A session, or showcasing my creative work, the Stream Deck MK.2 empowers me to execute tasks effortlessly and elevate the overall quality of my streams.",
                "2": "Stream Deck is a powerhouse of a studio controller, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its capabilities. Right from the moment you hold it, the build quality exudes excellence, and the screens in each button offer outstanding clarity.\n\nWhat truly sets this product apart is the accompanying app. It's a game-changer, providing seemingly endless possibilities for customization. Whether you're programming a soundboard, managing smart switches for lights and speakers, or initiating apps, the Stream Deck handles it all with ease.\n\nWhile I find it relatively simple to use, it's undoubtedly a power user product. It might not be as useful for casual users due to the learning curve in setting it up and maximizing its potential. However, for those willing to invest the time, it's a tool that opens up a world of creativity and efficiency.\n\nIts build quality, clarity, and the versatility of the app make it a must-have for streamers, content creators, and anyone seeking a highly customizable control hub for their digital activities.",
                "3": "I am a writer and entrepreneur and the ability to program the buttons to do multiple consecutive actions has completely revolutionized my work flow. I can do everything from control the media center in the home, to pull up my favorite research sites or blogs with the push of a button.\n\nI'm not a gamer or streamer and I can't stop raving about this thing to anyone who will listen. I can pull up scrivener, have it locked to one side, and open a google window with 3 tabs and lock it to the other. The sky is the limit, you can program whatever you can imagine.",
                "4": "Honestly I was questioning this purchase since it costs as much a decent keyboard, but this is very handy as a computer accessory. With plugins and the power of macros this bad boy can perform an endless amount of tasks with one press. I also can't deny it's asthetically pleasing",
                "5": "Great purchase for when my friends and I stream. Easy to set up and there are plenty of videos on YouTube walking you through how to make the most out of it.",
                "6": "I am not a streamer. I am a professional game designer. I am also disabled. I bought this to have a programmable 15 button macro keypad to supplant multi key keyboard inputs which I do hundreds or thousands of times a day for work.\n\nI had this up and running out of box and customized in less than an hour. It's great. Just the undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, paste special, alt tab (change window), and combined copy then paste buttons alone makes my day job so so so so so much easier and less painful at the end of the day. If you have fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel, anything like that and do office work where you're affected by ergonomics, esp. if you use your keyboard two key buttons a lot (ie copy paste etc) you will benefit from and love this.\n\nOnly one star off for: keys are more \"squishy\" than I would want compared to a keyboard or game pad or arcade \"click\" buttons; the raised dot in center key blurs the image which I don't like it's harder to read that key, the plastic keys reflect light so if positioned wrong it's hard to see should have used glare free plastic, and it should have on board memory to save my buttons I shouldn't have to do that via a cloud save and import whatever. Lastly, one drawback in the design is no physical power button, and an external one connected in didn't work (disabled the device). In order to remote into my work computer I have to leave it on, but when I lock my computer the display on this remains on which I assume will wear out the display faster being on all the time, so I physically unplug it, and due to the angles it's hard to physically unplug behind the device, and my computer is far away and on the floor so it's impossible to unplug there, and external switch renders the device powerless so far so that's a slight disappointment but I believe I found a screen saver setting that may be turning the display off when locked now too but it wasn't the default.\n\nIf even thinking this could help you with key entry for a disability then jump on it you won't regret it. Spread the word this is NOT just for streamers. It rocks. Thank you to the makers for making my work life that much faster and easier.",
                "7": "I love my stream deck. It's very compact but has all of my buttons, software is very easy to learn. I was so excited when I was offered same day delivery and for it to get here almost an hour or two early I was over the moon. I plan to use the hell put of it so I can buy another one.",
                "8": "Stream deck was well worth it.\nEasy to set up and use.\nLove that it lets me give it whatever task at a press of a button. As in the picture, I have a button to open spotify, pause/play, skip a song, and go back while im in game.\nThere are also plugins to use with the stream deck which give it even more customization. Some include, discord, streamlabs, spotify, twitch studio, twitter and many more.\nFor example, with the discord plugin, i can join a voice channel with 1 button click and leave with the same click. Boom super easy\nYou can also add images to the icons that youd like and so on. Everything can be customized in anyway that youd like.\nI have not had a problem with the stream deck and have enjoyed using it so far to stream and use as a soundboard too whenever im playing with some friends.",
                "9": "I purchased this trying to solve an issue for when in conference calls and trying to quickly unmute and/or toggle the camera on/off. And while I was at it, I figured I could use it to speed up my photo and video editing workflows and maybe some productivity.\n\nWell, the conference call situation was resolved by a 3rd party (aka paid app) called Mutedeck, but I got to work fine. My issue was with app profile switching and the functionality of said profiles. I just couldn't get it to work right. Many of the workflow profiles were paid-to-play, and quite frankly after spending $150, I was expecting a bit more built-in functionality.\n\nBuild quality, button feedback and image quality were pretty awesome.\n\nI ended up returning it and replaced it with a Lupedeck Live which has built-in profiles for most adobe suite apps. I has a bunch of knobs that allow editing much quicker and more intuitive.",
                "10": "The Elgato Stream Deck is a compact powerhouse for content creators, offering customizable control with its sleek, durable design. Its intuitive software allows for easy assignment of actions and macros to the programmable buttons, streamlining tasks with a single touch. The dynamic LCD keys with customizable icons provide visual feedback, enhancing engagement without constant screen glancing. With seamless integration into popular platforms and support for plugins, the Elgato Stream Deck is a versatile tool that justifies its higher price tag for those serious about content creation and streaming. By the way, I only use it for gaming with my friends and capturing clips for games to enjoy memories, so it's worth $150. The day I ordered it was on 12/11/2023."

                "1": "I recently purchased the Nintendo Switch controller charging dock, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations! This charging dock is not only incredibly easy to utilize, but it also adds a touch of style to my gaming setup with its red and green color indicators.\n\nThe red and green colors on the charging dock are a genius addition, as they clearly indicate the charging status of the controllers. Red means the controllers are still charging, while green tells me they are fully charged and ready to go. This feature has made it so much easier for me to keep track of my controller’s battery levels, ensuring that I never run out of juice in the middle of an intense gaming session.\n\nAnother aspect that I love about this charging dock is how perfectly it fits the Nintendo Switch controllers. The dock securely holds the controllers in place, preventing any accidental slips or falls. It gives me peace of mind knowing that my controllers are not only charging efficiently but also being stored safely.\n\nFurthermore, the dock’s design allows it to connect seamlessly to my USB charging dock, eliminating the need for additional cables or clutter on my gaming desk. It’s a simple and elegant solution that keeps everything organized and easily accessible.\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Nintendo Switch controller charging dock. Its ease of use, the clever use of red and green colors for charging status, and its perfect fit for the controllers make it a must-have accessory for any Nintendo Switch owner. If you’re looking for a reliable and stylish charging dock, look no further!\n\nPros:\n\n• Easy to utilize\n• Red and green color indicators for charging status\n• Perfect fit for Nintendo Switch controllers\n• Connects seamlessly to USB charging dock\n• Securely holds controllers in place\n\nCons:\n\n• None that I have found so far!\n\nI hope you find this review helpful! Happy gaming!",
                "2": "It's a really simple device, it attaches easily, and charges up to 4 controllers, it does its job well and doesn't take much space, it's not too bright but it does clearly tell you when the charging is done. Decent quality given price",
                "3": "The dock its effective at charging the joycons and its nice that it integrates cleanly with the switch dock. The only problem i had with the dock is there isn't really any click or secure feeling attachment mechanism on the joycon stands. they just kinda mush onto the charging dock which doesn't feel too great but the joycons charge so it doesn't hard functionality. overall works great and is a great value.",
                "4": "I love how this device allows me to charge the joy cons not attached to my switch, so they'll always be ready to play! One small gripe is the game slots. It holds the games well, but because of they way it holds them (and partly due to my overactive brain), I forget what games are where, and wind up having to pull the games out until I find the one I need.",
                "5": "The charger has a smaller footprint than the other quad chargers I have seen. It hugs the shape of the console, so it doesn’t take up a lot of room. The charger also does not run the length of the joy-con. This means that you don’t have to press the release to pull them from the station, a common issue I find with other chargers. Personally I find what sets this charger apart is the external game cartridge holder. This is incredibly convenient for quick and easy access to your favorite games, keeping things neat and orderly.\nI have very few complaints. Firstly, I wish there was an audible ‘click’ or snap when the joy-cons are inserted. I guess that’s a trade-off when the charger doesn’t run the length of the controllers, but it is something I would prefer to have than not have. This also means that the controllers are slightly loose while charging. No problems with a bad connection or anything, just wish it felt more secure. Secondly, the charger feels a little cheap. I guess you get what you pay for in this case.\nIt is a charger that works, it is convenient, and keeps things neat and orderly. My only complaints are that it feels a bit cheap for my taste, and the controllers don’t feel secure when docked",
                "6": "The price is right, it arrived fast, easy to attach, looks nice, allows one to charge up to 7 controllers at once, and helps organize you consol, game, and controller situation. When I say 7 controllers, I mean that it leaves one access to the second USB port, so that you can plug in your larger controller as well. I haven't tried the game \"storage,\" because I have toddlers that would scatter the games about the house, but it seems that it would work out nicely if I were to use it. I will try and update my review about it's durability after I've been using it for awhile. So far it's seems to be a pretty great purchase.",
                "7": "Works perfect for our needs and I definitely recommend",
                "8": "Awesome dock. Everything fits great. Good way to organize games and controllers",
                "9": "We have another charging station that just takes up room. This is great because it attaches right to the console.",
                "10": "Este cargador es muy funcional y al tener un switch de encendido, permite tener los controles organizados sin peligro de sobrecarga … muy UEN producto.",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "I became a fan of FromSoftware in 2015 with the release of Bloodborne. I have liked every game they have put out since (besides Sekiro; hated that one) and we have another winner in the form of Armored Core 6. The action is probably the best part of this game, as is the story and the voice acting as well. The sheer amount of mech customization is excellent too. I will say however I think it took a little while for the story to get going; I cared more about the plot/characters the further in I got. Not every mission is fun, but the missions that are fun, are REALLY fun. The story peaked when we [spoiler] destroyed the ice worm.\n\nIf you want a \"souls-like\" in the form of mech combat, then definitely pick this one up. I haven't played any other Armored Core games so I can't vouch for how faithful it is to what came before. Challenging but fun gameplay; if anything I'm definitely more interested in the older titles now.",
                "2": "Coming into this game, I've played though a bit of Armored Core 3 on the PS2 to judge if the series would be worthwhile for me to get into, given I've heard that AC3 was the most approachable out of the older-generation games... Turns out AC3 helped me fall in love with the series, haha.\n\nAnyways... When I dove into this game shortly after getting the PS5 system I got it for, I personally noticed that the controls were far more intuitive and responsive compared to the clunkiness of AC3's default controls, and I got the hang of things pretty quickly as I went through the tutorial mission.\n\nWhen I proceeded to get to the tutorial mission's boss, namely a giant helicopter, I got blown up SEVERAL times as I tried to fight it off... However, I discovered that being aggressive and utilizing your mech's flying ability to dodge the chopper's onslaughts was key in attaining victory.\n\nAs you progress through the story mode, you'll unlock several parts that you can buy or find during missions, and you'll be able to install them onto your mech, allowing for INCREDIBLE amounts of customization with the multitude of parts you'll eventually be able to use.\n\nThe game primarily focuses on the single-player campaign, which is a \"stereotypically Armored Core\" sort of affair, featuring your player character as a mercenary accepting missions for various factions that are fighting each other on the planet Rubicon 3 over Coral, a highly valuable energy source.\n\nI'm on Chapter 4 of my first playthrough as of this writing, but be aware that repeat playthroughs will reward additional parts as you progress. I haven't gotten to the point of starting a New Game Plus playthrough yet, but I'll be sure to dive into that whenever I get an itch for AC6 in the future.\n\nThere is multiplayer available after progressing to a certain point in the story, but it only allows for custom matches as of this review's writing.\n\nGiven that I generally vibe with mech and robot games, like Custom Robo, I found myself hyper-fixating on this game through how I can customize my own mechs endlessly, as I often tweaked my builds depending on the mission.\n\nI find that this is the most approachable Armored Core game, given that the controls are fairly easy to learn and intuitive. It's also easy to make a good profit between missions, unlike in past games where you could potentially go into debt by doing poorly, mis-managing your ammo, or even outright failing the mission.\n\nIn conclusion, I am in LOVE with this game so far, and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes one of my personal all-time favorites once I'm through with it.",
                "3": "Great addition to the series. Fast, frenetic combat and endless customization options to your AC. Just don't expect to step in and be proficient right away if you've never played any past Armor Core games but are accustomed to the other recent FromSoftware games; this is a different beast. Once you've learned the ropes though, you'll be in the garage building countless AC loadouts and darting around the combat field guns blazing!",
                "4": "I love fromsoft games and I love this game. Fast paced, highly customizable, and quite difficult. Very rewarding, highly reccomended for those who have the skills and willpower to play it.",
                "5": "Love the Armored Core franchise. Good game but a bit short on campaign play",
                "6": "It’s a very fun game and a nice challenge seems easy when you get the hang of it but the games very quick to humble",
                "7": "Good game, boss fights are difficult but that is to be expected form an Armoured Core game. I don't understand the 1 star reviews because of difficulty. The game looks great and controls are good. Definitely takes a min to figure out what the best weapon to use on bosses but once you figure it out it's really not that hard. 1st boss goes down easy with a charge then sword attack. I absolutely love the customization of your mech.",
                "8": "Great new entry in a long lasting series. Great new improvements to the way the mechs handle and the graphics have been updated a lot since the last entry.",
                "9": "I don't usually play difficult games. Other FromSoft titles aren't for me. I've tried Dark Souls and Sekiro, never beaten them because I was terrible at them. For some reason, Armored Core 6 is something I can't put down. I'm still terrible at it. I've failed missions countless times, but I'm enjoying it none the less. Mech customization is great, missions/objectives are varied enough in my opinion. There is the Arena mode, which I've always enjoyed since Armored Core 3. As I ascend ranks, I feel like an underdog that no one saw coming. The only downside for me was the fact that level design isn't as varied as I'd hope. But that's a personal taste. Don't get me wrong, I really like what's already there, I just wish there was more.\nI'd say try the game first. Borrow a friend or relative. Then make your decision to either buy it or not. I bought it on a whim all because of my history with Armored Core games, and I'm glad to say I don't regret it, not one bit.",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "When I first got my Quest 2 headset the straps that came with it gave me headaches every time I played and severely limited my play time unless I was feeling stubborn enough to deal with the pain. It'd be a safe bet after 2-3 hours of play (basically nothing for me), and sometimes much less than that, I'd have a pretty severe headache for the rest of the day. I installed this strap setup and the headaches are pretty much entirely gone. I've played for at least one full charge every day since I got this product and played for ~12 hours (including a charge break) the day before writing this review and the difference is beyond night and day. The worst thing I've experienced is occasionally a hair might get tugged but that has happened maybe once or twice so far.\n\nThe strap and back pad are nice and soft. The adjustment is easy and doesn't change with gameplay (unlike the original strap) unless you change it yourself. The adjustment is controlled by a dial on the plastic section behind the back pad and clicks when tightening. The up and down pivot ability is also helping to keep the lenses cleaner too since as advertised you put it straight on then lower the strap setup rather than sliding it all down over your face and hair. Installation was very easy too. The worst part for me was the visor removal but that's just because I always do things like that slowly and deliberately to help make sure I don't break anything. It's really simple and easy to get it done. It's also making the use of a link cable easier as the side portions are flexible plastic allowing much better use of my cable's provided retention strap. There is no pressure at all on the sides of your head and the back pad cradles the back of your head in it's soft foam while the top strap sits like the original but is also made of that same foam. The artificial leather covering the foam it also very soft and smooth. The whole thing is significantly more comfortable and it does a significantly better job of distributing pressure without making you feel like your head is going to pop. It also adds a little weight to the back of your head giving a bit of counterbalance the old elastic straps couldn't provide.\n\nI've mostly played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, & Hand Grenades (which is an absolutely fantastic game btw) and some Pavlov since I got it and tend to be quick and aggressive with movements including turning. Provided it's properly adjusted it doesn't move. Still have to try Blade & Sorcery with it but I have no doubt it'll do every bit as well with that too.\n\nThe only real issue I can think of is if you bend down too far and it's loose enough there's a risk of it falling off. Just don't try to look between your legs and keep it properly adjusted and you should be good lol. I'd rather deal with this minor risk than the relentless pressure of the original straps any day.\n\nThis product made my Quest 2 much more playable and fun. Do yourself a favor and ditch the elastic straps your headset likely came with and buy one of these today.",
                "2": "I don't usually write reviews for products like this, but when I do, it's the highest honor I can bestow for such an item. This strap has bettered my Quest 2 experience ten-fold. It is hands down one of the best head straps on the market for this headset. The ratcheting mechanism on the headset tightens on your head to provide the best fit, and once its on there, it STAYS on there. Even with the biggest of noggins, it finds a way to fit, no matter what. And the best part? It's comfortable. Period. When I have this on, I forget that it's even there. Not to mention that it pivots so you can take the headset off easier. All for $30, with better build quality than the official Elite strap. If you had thoughts about this and need a better experience with your new or already loved headset, this is a no-brainer.",
                "3": "This was the best thing I could buy to enhance my VR experience. The original Oculus Headset strap is not very comfortable after hours of playing and it doesn’t support the headset pressure on your face very well. The KIWI design Comfort Head Strap is better in every way. It takes the pressure off your face, it has padding for the back/top of your head, it’s adjustable & easy to install. It’s pretty sturdy and it also fits in my carrying case.",
                "4": "This strap is definitely a better product than the original Oculus strap, and the one Meta is currently selling to replace the original. Well built, easy to put together and install. It is also more comfortable than the original one. A definite improvement and a must-have for Oculus 2. My only problem with it is that it does not fit well on the off-brand case I purchased for my Oculus 2. I basically have to cramp it in there and force the case to close. If you have a small carrying case, it may not fit. However, overall it is a great product at a good price, and I recommend it.",
                "5": "I love this thing. It's made using my headset a lot more, and I mean a LOT more comfortable. The strap it comes with is garbage, and I don't know why something like this assembly isn't the default (aside from the obvious money making reasons). It helps offset the weight of the headset so you aren't constantly having to readjust. This has the added effect of relieving pressure on your face and lessens the indentations on your skin that you'd get by using the default setup. It's also much easier to wipe down and clean after a heavy beat saber session. The dial on the back also makes adjustment a breeze. It even fits my big old nogging, so I'm certain it'll work well for you.\n\nSolid product, definitely recommend.",
                "6": "Love this replacement head strap for my Meta 2! Before we got this it was always a struggle to get the VR to fit properly between my husband and I. But now, it adjusts super easy once you put it on and comes off easy without yanking your glasses off. The key to that is to lift the back of the headstrap before you remove the goggles from your glasses. And the padding is very comfortable. It really makes the VR feel much more balanced on your head too. It was very easy to install. It came with a couple extras, like a silicone cover for the joystick on the controller and a new face protector that goes around the edge of the goggles that touch your face. I did use the silicone joystick cover, but not the face protector yet. Will keep that for when the factory one gets worn out.",
                "7": "On a whim I bought my 61-year old best friend and myself Mega Quest 2 headsets so we could start playing in the VR world. Yes, we had a learning curve at first, they're a bit beyond our Atari days, but we're enjoying them. They were difficult to keep in place on our heads and often my forehead would be numb after playing so I decided to invest in these comfort head straps. They are exactly as described and so worth it. They make the gaming experience so much more comfortable, easy to install, high quality construction, and no more numb-head. I might even get the additional battery because we're becoming so addicted to this new way to play games a single battery charge isn't enough to keep up with us!",
                "8": "After 3 or 4 months with this headstrap, I'd say this is an essential upgrade to the Quest 2. This was purchased just due to the original breaking after some plastic fatigue. I wasn't looking for a more comfortable, or convienent headstrap, but wow, I got one.\n\nThe quality of life using the Quest2 improved substantially, especially if you're switching between multiple people using the device. The ability to quickly adjust the headshet between users, without having to deal with velcro and thightening straps is a huge step-up. The ability to keep the headset on, but flip up the visor is a game changer when you need to quickly view your surroundings or check your phone.\n\nThe comfrot is an improvement, with the soft padding. It also sits the quest more firmly and securely to your face. I can be a bit more active with the quest and not feel the slight movement and giggle I'd get with the orignal straps. To get the same secure fitting with the original would require the straps to be so tight, it would hurt after a session. The Kiwi sits solid on my face and feels soft and comfy behind my head.",
                "9": "I am so happy I found this head strap! The Quest 2 used to give me headaches because of how uncomfortable it was. Now I feel like I could wear it for hours!! The oval shaped cushion in the back really helps as I no longer feel the full weight of the headset on my forehead crushing me!! It fits like a dream. All cushy in the right places. The adjuster knob on the back to tighten or loosen is simple to use, not all complicated like the PSVR2’s head strap. I hardly played my Quest 2 because of how heavy and bad it felt on my face, now I am able to enjoy my VR so much more, I should’ve bought this sooner. Invest in a good head strap like this one so you can play your VR with more ease and comfort.",
                "10": "Essential Accessory. Don't use Quest 2 without it. This strap is so much better than the original pieces of velcro tape. Those were so uncomfortable and gave me headaches after about 30 minutes. It would keep shifting and it would shake the video too. This one is perfect. It is solidly built and easy to use. It has more weight but is not heavy to make it uncomfortable. The screw to tighten and loosen works nicely to get a good fit. It fits like a snug helmet. My extra battery easily sits on the top strap. Not pricy too. Meta should just purchase this design from this company and sell the headsets with it because the strap that comes with quest-2 is useless and will deter people from using it."

                "2": "Never had an issue with it, the battery life is great and I love that the LEDs can be customized by just pressing a button. Very easy to connect to other devices and good quality. Definitely worth a buy",
                "3": "Controller works great and the battery lasts for longer than I thought it would have. The construction is a little lighter than i thought it would be and it’s not as robust as other controllers but as long as you’re not raging that isn’t an issue. Definitely a good bang for your buck.",
                "4": "Rechargable, solid feel, vibration, easy to connect",
                "5": "Works as advertised and fits nicely in your hands.",
                "6": "I purchased 4 of thse controllers in the cracked black color. The controllers are light but feel well built. The thumbsticks are very snappy and responsive to the platforming and shooting titles I have played with no delays. The buttons are not bad either. I love the extra colors these controllers emit. I have a family of 4 and each person can set their controllers to a pulsing rainbow or any other color of their choosing to give them a more customized feel when playing couch Co op titles making times like these a bit more magical. The light hardly effects the battery life on each controller I have tested with the results matching the battery life claims made by this seller. The turbo feature doesn't work on most titles I've played on. These controllers also work when I'm using Samsung deck on the go or my television to play roms and citra and multi emulator. I also can toggle the amount of rumble this controller will emit whether I want more or less or none from the 3 modes. I did not program the extra buttons underneath for any roms but I can see this particularly nice for a nostalgic n64 feel. These controllers do not come with emote functionality but oh well. I also love how I can use any of these controllers to turn on and off my switch after they have paired the first time with their usb c cable connected into the console. For the price and the quality features on this controller I would give this 10 stars if I could.",
                "7": "Why spend more money for a worse controller just cause it says nintendo? This one is just as good if not better for half the price. Haven't had issues yet where with my other controller i had to buy a kit to switch out the thumb stick.",
                "8": "This controller, is actually pretty darn good.",
                "9": "Kind of light weight and “clicky” buttons compared to the authentic Pro controller. But works great and the price makes these more than acceptable. I have not experimented with the “turbo” functions and don’t expect to get any use out of them.",
                "10": "A little confusing because of the 4 lights only 1 lights up so it seems like it's never fully charged, but never runs out so that's good! It has so many buttons on the bottom, kinda overkill if you don't know what you're doing. But over all it works well."

This isn't just a wireless gaming mouse, it's a revolutionary device that blends comfort, precision, and personalization.\n\nIts ergonomic design was the first thing that drew me in. The mouse nestles perfectly in my hand, providing comfort during extended gaming marathons. While the design is primarily tailored for larger hands, I found it quite comfortable even with my average-sized hands.\n\nThe HyperScroll Tilt Wheel and 11 programmable buttons are the standout features. The tilt wheel's dual-mode allows for a switch between tactile and free-spin scrolling, offering a versatile user experience. The programmable buttons let me tailor my gaming preferences, boosting my speed and efficiency.\n\nThe Focus Pro 30K Sensor and Fast Optical Switches Gen-3 are the crowning features of this mouse. The upgraded sensor and switches deliver an impressively low click latency, leading to a highly responsive gaming experience. The sensor's performance is top-notch, making it an ideal choice for FPS gaming.\n\nThe Chroma RGB lighting lends a visual charm to the mouse, transforming it from a mere device to an integral part of my gaming setup's character.\n\nHowever, the Basilisk V3 Pro does come with a substantial price tag. The wireless charging dock and HyperPolling dongle are sold separately, which adds to the overall cost. Despite the steep price, I believe the features and performance make it a worthwhile investment.\n\nIn conclusion, the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is a high-end gaming mouse that offers a mix of comfort, customization, and superior performance. It's a valuable investment for any serious gamer seeking to enhance their gaming experience.\n\nAdditionally, the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is compatible with the Anker 315 Wireless Charger (Pad) https://amzn.to/46WLdMZ which offers 10W Max Fast Charging. If you’re exploring wireless charging solutions, the Razer Wireless Charging Puck for the Basilisk V3 Pro Gaming Mouse is worth considering.\n\nAffiliate link to both products:\nThe Razer Basilisk V3 Pro: https://amzn.to/3QI67ts\nAnker 315 Wireless Charger (Pad): https://amzn.to/46WLdMZ",
                "45": "I am really enjoying this mouse. Is it my favorite mouse? Hard to say, I have different mice for different things. I have a Naga Pro for MOBAs and MMOs, a Deathadder v2 Pro for FPS, and an Orochi for my gaming laptop. I also have a drawer full of other mice that I enjoy using from time to time like the Roccat Burst Pro that was my daily driver for nearly a year.\n\nSo where does this mouse fit in? To me, this is the best all-rounder. The hyperscroll is great for getting through long webpages or spreadsheets. Combined with its comfortable ergonomic shape, and low noise and pleasant feel, it is excellent as an office mouse.\n\nHowever, it is great for FPS games as well. The main buttons feel nice to click. The side buttons are easy to find and press. And I have even found myself using the clutch every now and then when sniping. And I have come to appreciate the thumb rest. No more accidently dragging the edge of my thumb on the mousepad.\n\nThe features do add some extra weight, however. This in turn makes it slightly less desirable than my Deathadder for shooters. But really not by much. I only notice the weight difference if I am quickly switching between them. In use though, I do just as well with the Basilisk as I do with the Deathadder. Both are comfy for long game sessions. with excellent ergonomics and good buttons. I do enjoy the scroll wheel on the Basilisk more than the Deathadder.\n\nI could probably press the Basilisk into service for a MOBA. However, I have grown accustomed to the Naga's six button side panel. Since I have the option, I would probably be included to use that LoL or HotS (not that I play either much anymore).\n\nFor MMOs there is nothing that can replace my Naga with the 12 button side panel. The Basilisk just cannot compete, and that's ok. MMO mice a very specialized thing. If you are at the point where you need 24+ keybinds on your mouse, you probably already have this covered.\n\nBut, if you need just one mouse in your life, I think the Basilisk is an excellent choice. Even if you are shopping office mice, give this one a look. The Smart-Reel Hyperscroll is a thing of beauty for the office once you get used to it. And when you are gaming, the sensitivity clutch can be really handy.\n\nAlso, the lighting looks pretty cool and it's easy to work with. Aesthetics are important too :D",
                "46": "Hardware:\n- Scroll wheel: its great. Second best feeling scroll wheel i have used. For context, its almost as good as one of the heavier logitech MX Master scroll wheels.\n- Weight: Its not a light mouse, but its perfect for me\n- Glide: Super smooth ptfe skates\n- Buttons: buttons are great. They sound good, and feel good. They are optical switches, so you dont need to worry about mis-clicks\n\nSoftware\n- response: its super responsive. no noticeable delay like (like with mx master mice)\n- Synapse: its still a little buggy, but the convenience if auto-switching profiles is too good.",
                "47": "I have used logitech gaming mice for ages, mx518, g5, g500, g502, g502s, and with them switching to gHub software, I had enough. Decided to give this a try, and oh boy, I am SO happy with it. The feel is nearly the same, but better. The rough texture is a big improvement. Few downsides, lacking the DPI up/down buttons and LEDs, its annoying, but not a big deal. For me the DPI shift button is a little too far up, compared to the g502s. The scroll click is very sensitive, and takes some getting used to.\n\nThe software install seems to auto-pupup when you plug the mouse in, which is convenient, but also a bit hmm. Software seems ok, but auto-enabled scroll wheel acceleration, which is the worst feature. Scroll too fast and it will accelerate the scroll, so its 'scroll a little oh look im 50 pages down'.\n\nOverall, a super solid mouse, and a gread replacement for the g502s if that's your go-to.",
                "48": "Bought this mouse after buying a couple Razer products and becoming a fan of the brand. This mouse feels amazing for gaming and in general. Style is neat, very customizable too. But the most impressive features are its build quality and ergonomy. The materials feel premium, with nice gripping textures for those who have sweaty hands like me. It also moves without effort, weight is optimal so the wrist is never overloaded and clicks feel very reliable. Overall very satisfied.",
                "49": "First of all it's a mid tier mouse with price and functionally. I truly love using this thing. It's very comfortable, light to medium weight vs wireless battery chargeable mice. The chord is light weight and sturdy. It feels like nothing but has never tangled or crinkled. It's very easy to set up your preselects in the software for DPI. The aim button is also useful when you're trying to line up shots in games or need precision movement in other applications. The RGB is also very nice because you can assign individual LEDs and make really aesthetically pleasing visuals. I have carpel tunnel and the comfort it provides helps a lot with an added mousepad that has a rise for your wrist. For the first two years I have had zero issues with it. The aim button is not mappable and purely functions as a massive DPI limiter. Mouse button 4 and 5 are functionally mappable with every game I've played.\n\nAfter two years... It's been easy to clean and maintain but unfortunately I'm now experiencing issues and looking to replace it. It's no longer matching the software RGB schemes as correctly as the keyboard. Scrolling is also suffering these days. I have it set to the mode which it will respond very tactile and go to free spin when scrolling which has been my favorite. It feels like the mechanism that switches is no longer quick to notice the key point it should reengage the tactile scroll, and sometimes will not work. What went from a strong response to reengage is now weak and heavily lacking almost like it's become tired. I thought this could be software related since physically there has been normal tame use (no slamming, jumping, or impacting). Unfortunately it seems that it's probably just power related wear and tear leading to internal component degradation. It's shocking because mice are so low power you'd figure the components would last long over two years, but then again it's probably had close to 3,650 hours of use.\n\nIt would have been 5 stars, but I expected this to last at least 5 years without problems.",
                "50": "These are great for every day use. To be honest most of the features like \"RGB\" and mapping functions to the extra buttons I completely skip over. I'm sure they're useful for playing computer games where there's very specific time pressure. For the stuff I use them for, writing documents, a bit of design work, a bit of circuit design, a bit of software dev, basically anything other than playing computer games, they're great.\n\nThe sensor is really sensetive so they work really well for very precise design work. The way the mouse wheel works on these is genius. They've added a buttom that lets one set the wheel between \"free wheeling\" and \" tightl;y controlled\" with a single press. If you're working on long documents, large diagrams, long web pages it's just a click and you can move up and down the length of the page very quickly. Then just press the button again and you have precise control and you can slowly move from line to line and get to exactly where you need to be. Navigation with any other mouse now feels slow and sluggish to me.\n\nThe little couloured lights are also useful, I have a few of these on the desk at once and setting them to different static colurs makes it easy to quickly identify which mouse is attached to which computer.\n\nThe quality is good, I've had one of these Basilisk v3's for about two years and no sign of any problems. I've had another Razer mouse for about eight years and while there are definite signs of wear it's to be expectted with a device that gets used all day every day. That one still functions perfectly even though there are tiny cracks where the plastic has become brittle and the pads underneath are all but worn off. By comparison I bought a different high quality gaming mouse manufatured by a competitor in the same segment and with that one the gears on the mouse wheel wore enough to lose friction with the spindle to the point where the mouse wheel was really frustrating to try to use within six months, so eight years I'd say is good value for money.",
                "51": "Buttons are all comfortably placed and I am extremely impressed with the feel and performance. I didn't know if I'd like or use the scroll wheel free-spin/notch modes but turns out I love it. It allows 3 DPI presets at the press of a button. If you like RGB stuff, the Razer apps are pretty neat. I only used it to make the kids happy though.\n\nBought this after 2 Steelseries mice",
                "52": "Basilisk is an awesome mouse for those that want an extra button for the thumb, and trust me it becomes an awesome advantage to have! The mouse is confortable to use and those new RGB zones look absolutely beautiful, making the zone where the mouse is on light up too, I can notice that the sensor reacts faster to any movement I do compared to the G502 Hero.\n\nThe previous Basilisk V2 had a problem where after 1 year or so, the mouse scroll would start acting erratically, specially if you had it set to move with very little force, this new Basilisk V3 is different as you can't adjust the force needed to move the scroll but I found that it is perfect out of the box: it doesn't require much force and also you can feel a nice bump each time you scroll, excelent for changing between weapons or inventory slots, I also assume that with this change, the scroll wheel may be more durable.\n\nSadly, one of the biggest downgrades of this mouse is the third extra button at the far left side of the mouse, in V2 this was a paddle that sat right at the top of your thumb, in V3 it's now an smaller button, it definitely isn't as confortable or easy to press as the V2 one or the G502 one, it's very sad, I hope we get a larger button or paddle on the Basilisk V4.",
                "53": "If you know how to position your hand in the mouse, you'll be very comfortable using it for hours. I feel that the design of the mouse taught me how to best hold it for maximum ergonomics. for big hands this is an 8/10 because my ring finger and pinky fall to the mouse pad. I love the wheel button that changes it to either smooth for scrolling or precise for swapping weapons in the games. The configuration through razer's synapse is great and I've had fun getting it right for me. Another button in the wheel area allows you to change the sensitivity of the pointer to pre-configured speeds that you can totally modify for easy access; up to 26,000 and have from 2 to 5 pre-configured stages. It has 9 areas of light underneath which you can make any combination you like and the wheel and razer logo use another set each, so you can modify with the chroma to your hearts content."

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "From the adult single player perspective, this is the most involved version of Animal Crossing to date. Customization is virtually limitless and it introduces the option of terraforming the land itself. The ways you can build up your island stretch beyond the imagination. New Horizons introduces crafting, seasonal items and recipes, download-based events that last longer than one day so they really feel like holidays, and advanced character customization right from the beginning. I'll break down the pros and cons at the end of my review.\n\nI think there is some confusion, especially for people new to the series, regarding how multiplayer works.\nAnimal Crossing has always been a ONE town/island game, with the option for up to 3 more players to share that land, since the idea is that you'd be building your oasis together. Unfortunately the co-op in this version is lackluster, especially since the Switch is marketed as a more social console than others Nintendo has released in the past. The multiplayer in a single town is, plain and simple, not worth it. Like others have said, you can really only play follow the leader and collect things together. It kinda defeats the purpose of true multiplayer mode, which is much more comprehensive in the console-to-console visiting (as it has been in the past as well). The true fun in multiplayer for ACNH is in visiting other islands entirely, seeing how they have built and organized their land, and exchanging exclusive fruits and rare items with each other (not to mention hitting each other endlessly with nets). If you have multiple consoles in your house or have friends with their own Switch and copy of the game, you'll find LOTS of enjoyment in the multiplayer.\n\nPROS:\n- Character customization is great. Skin tone is finally a choice, alongside many hairstyles and colors which become unlockable over time. Many basics are included right from the beginning and can be changed whenever you'd like.\n- Able Sisters is a true boutique. Every day they have a large stock of clothing, including many color variants. You can also layer multiple facial accessories.\n- Designing is a joy. The designer feature seems to \"read\" what shapes and colors you use and will round out sharp edges. This means any user-designed paths, stones, and clothing will blend in seamlessly with the soft graphics of the game. You can choose from different styles of clothing while you design, such as sweaters, robes, bowler hats, and beanies. Additionally, there is now an option for transparent patterns. No more having 4 different stepping stone designs for every season so the grass around your rocks will blend in with the natural grass. There is also a \"face paint\" option, which is very useful for equipping your character with eyebrows, freckles, etc.\n- Nook Miles ticket islands are worthwhile to work for, and allow you access to more crafting resources that you may have exhausted out of your own island for the day. They also have a chance to spawn rare creatures, Bell rocks, foreign fruits, and hybrid flowers.\n- The graphics have received a huge update. Everything in the game, including returning items, has a new model and looks better than ever. Wind rustles trees, flowers, and even items that have hanging bits, such as the clothing racks.\n- Your storage system is automatically built into your home, and home design is streamlined into a drag and drop menu for easy decorating.\n- Being able to put any item outdoors and build pathways has transformed the possibilities in this game. You can make so many things: trading booths, actual gardens, shop stands, playgrounds, cafes, spas, raffles, relay races, you name it. I've seen an incredible amount of creativity in the first week of release.\n- You can choose where your new villagers will move, and move any building at any time, save for the plaza and Resident Services within it. There is a cost involved but it's well worth it if you hate where something is placed.\n- So far I have not yet reached the cap on constructing inclines and bridges. You can make a bunch.\n\nCONS:\n- Terraforming takes a bit to unlock and can be finicky to navigate. You may think you're standing on the correct tile to place a path or build a cliff, but you'll be pushed to another tile, have to erase, and try again. Understanding where you are in space is just a little more difficult because the layout of your island looks a lot less geometric than it did in the past, but overall that is still a positive. Just makes terraforming a bit harder.\n- In the 3DS New Leaf: Welcome Amiibo version, scanning an Amiibo card would allow you to replace any resident villager with the one on your card, and they would move in the next day. In this version, scanning a card will put the villager in your campsite, but you must invite them to move in THREE times before they will agree. It just seems like a bit of work, since any random villager you find on a Nook Miles Island will move in the very next day after you ask them.\n- This is my big one: Blathers' museum, while changed drastically to be incredibly beautiful, no longer displays facts for donated creatures. Reading a sign will just give you the name of the creature and donor. To learn about a creature, you need to have it in your inventory and give it to Blathers under the request to learn more. This feels like a huge hit to the museum which is already lacking features. It seemed like they removed the one main reason to visit.\n- No sign of my favorite NPCs, Katrina (fortune teller) and Brewster (cafe owner). Hopefully, though, there are plans to implement them at a later date, as the game receives regular updates.\n\nOverall, this is a staple in any casual gamer's collection, a great intro for anyone new to the series, and something pleasant to pick up whenever and wherever, regardless of whether you have countless hours or just a few minutes. Give it a try!",

                "3": "We can communicate with each other through the mail in the game. My mother and step daughter have completely bonded over this. So much fun. Wonderful design. Used to play in college twenty years ago. So glad this game evolved they way it did. I owe many hours of fun to the creator.",
                "4": "I had to replace this game for my daughter who list hers. The US Switch version is exactly what I needed. This game rocks, totally worth buying twice if need be.",
                "5": "It's perfect for when I just want to relax on my porch swing for a couple of hours. There's lots to do, and the characters are cute. If you have friends who play, you can visit each others' islands.",
                "6": "Love the new game, adds fun to the whole family",
                "7": "I remembered buying Animal Crossing New Leaf for the Nintendo 3DS back when it was released in america via 2013, while Japan got the game in later 2012. New Leaf was absolutely INCREDIBLE! It is the perfect game for the Nintendo 3DS and it is an insanely addicting game that is VERY hard to put down. The first 3-6 months I played new leaf anywhere between 2-5 hours per day. Then eventually I played it for 1-3 hours per day because there is ALWAYS something new to buy and do. I clocked in 1,325 hours for New Leaf according to my Nintendo 3DS playing time logs. My nephew accidentally started a new save file over my 1,325 hours file save. I stopped playing then cause I didnt feel like doing it all over again. Then, new horizons was announced and the whole world rejoiced! New Horizons absolutely blew my expectations of the game cause I was slightly worried the game would feel more like the portable version aka Animal Crossing: Wild Word for the original Nintendo DS and of course Animal crossing New Leaf for the Nintendo 3DS. Now, dont get me wrong, both portable games were stellar and absolutely FUN. However, animal crossing fans still miss the original Animal Crossing gamecube game cause that game was truly the best animal crossing game. I am glad and happy to say that Animal Crossint New Horizons for the Switch, definitely brings you back to the joy of playing the original game on the gamecube. New Horizons has so much new additions added that it really feels like a BIG console game rather than a not so big game on the handhelds. I've logged about 15 hours already into new horizons and I've already put more time into New Horizons than I did with New Leaf during the first 48 hours of owning this game. One example of New Horizons many features in the game is the terraforming addition. Yes, you read correctly! You can move mountains and dirt in order to design your island EXACTLY the way you want it to be. Being able to cross a river without going around it by finding a different detour path, you can add dirt/ground into the river, then simply walk over to the other side of the land. Just wait till you unlock that feature in the game cause I never knew animal crossing needed a feature like that and I'm extremely happy the devs added that into the game. Anyways, I dont want to spoil anything else, just BUY this game asap. I strongly recommend you buy the physical copy of the game cause then if anything happens to your save file on the switch, you could end up losing it and never get it back due to Nintendo cloud saving feature being totally backwards. Only allowing one save file and each save file is for that specific switch you own. However, if you buy the physical copy of new horizons, at least your save file will always be saved in that cartridge copy of animal crossing new horizons. Apologized for the long nonsense review of this game but seriously buy it!",
                "8": "Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a game that's hard to describe. On the surface, it may seem like a simple life simulation game, but in reality, it's so much more than that. It's a game that's full of charm, personality, and endless possibilities, and it's easily one of the best games available on Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple: you move to a deserted island and must build it up into a thriving community. But the beauty of Animal Crossing: New Horizons lies in the details. The game is full of little touches and surprises that make the world feel alive and dynamic. From the changing seasons to the daily events and interactions with the game's cast of lovable characters, there's always something new and exciting to discover.\n\nBut what really makes Animal Crossing: New Horizons stand out is the level of customization it offers. You can decorate your house and island with a wide range of furniture, decorations, and other items. You can even create your own designs and patterns to use on clothes, furniture, and more. And with the ability to play with friends both locally and online, there's no shortage of creative opportunities.\n\nOne of the things I love most about Animal Crossing: New Horizons is how it encourages you to slow down and take things at your own pace. There are no strict objectives or time limits, and the game's gentle, relaxing atmosphere makes it the perfect way to unwind after a long day.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend Animal Crossing: New Horizons enough. It's a game that's full of heart and charm, and it's sure to keep you entertained for hours on end. So if you're looking for a game that's both relaxing and engaging, look no further than Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Nintendo Switch.",
                "9": "Ho boy. I'm not sure where to begin. There is really a lot to say about the long awaited addition to the Animal Crossing family and to be fair, some of it is positive. To be honest, plenty of the criticism is deserved as well.\nAs a mother of four kids and a fan of the game myself (yep, I played it on the wii and fell in love. The ONLY video game I've ever truly been a fan of- what can I say? It helps me de-stress!), I'm not going to pull any punches when I say that the one island per Switch thing is ridiculous and could in fact damage future development and/or releases. This is a deal breaker for a lot of families. We went ahead and bought the game knowing this was an issue but were hoping to give it a try. After all, we shared City Folk just fine. But one of the main issues is that the person who starts the game sort of gets everything and takes over the development of the island while the other players are just kind of left in the dust for a while. Sure, they still gain points, manage their homes, get DIY plans, but everything they do comes slower, fewer, and is held up by the first player. They're not really creating their own story- they're following in the shadows of the story the first player started. I say that as the first player of our game and it stinks. I would have loved to have passed on some of the challenges and rewards to my kids to complete but instead I just felt rushed to get as much done as possible so they could progress as well.\nAnother interesting tidbit- and many won't care about this but conservative parents might so I'm mentioning it for them- are the few LGBT references in the American or English version of the game. The Japanese version strangely doesn't contain these references but they were included in the English version and this is notable to me. I firmly believe in equal rights but in what is very much a children's game with talking animals, I fail to understand how it was necessary to include these references. Why do sexual preferences even need to play a part in a game such as this? Without warning, the creators have chosen to include references that feel out of place and a bit like pandering. I'm left scratching my head and wondering, \"Why?\" And if it was so important to include, why was it left out of other versions? Can't we decide what we deem appropriate for our home and kids rather than having Nintendo make a blanket determination of our culture and then plopping something into the game that they won't even include in their country's version? It's just an odd choice for this type of game. If this seems vague, search it out. The information about this is available. Another issue along these lines is the deletion of gender. I'm aware that there was a group of people that wanted non-binary options in the game, but it seems that gender pronouns have been erased entirely in only the US version. Players are referred to as \"they\" and \"their\" by the animals. This is probably my biggest gripe. There is a VERY small population of the US that identifies as completely non-binary. Of that group, it's another small population that plays animal crossing, but any references to \"she\" and \"he\" have been replaced in the game with \"they.\" My entire family would prefer to have our pronouns of \"she\" or \"he\" used but, so far, this is not an option. It would be great if we could at least choose to have standard pronouns acknowledged rather than erasing the option entirely. An update would take care of this.\nAs far as some of the changes, like crafting your own tools, there is good and bad. It can be fun to get new plans for building and it adds an element of excitement as the game progresses. However, it can be incredibly tedious trying to constantly gather resources for the many tasks you will have thrown at you. And as the first player, you will be hogging resources the other players will need as well and there simply aren't enough to go around at first. I quickly grew tired of having to gather, gather, gather for Nook's demands when I really wanted to just explore the island. But much of your exploration largely depends on getting those things done.\nAlso, some islands start off with only about a quarter or less of the island available to build on. We stupidly chose one of those not realizing we wouldn't have access to the rest of the island for a while. This meant we had to place four human player tents, two animal tents, the museum, and Nook's nephews' shop all in the same tiny area. Needless to say, some of us are relocating as soon as that becomes an option because we're all horribly cramped into one space. Keep in mind, relocating is expensive. It becomes more expensive as the game progresses and you gain more control over the island's design.\nAs for some of the positives, the graphics are lovely and pleasing. The island setting is fun and the water, the sounds, the scenery are awesome. This makes for delightful game play. They nailed the sound of rain, the distant rumble of thunder, the wind picking up in the afternoon- such fun elements!! Visiting other islands is a cool bonus even if it does get a bit tedious when four islands in a row are pretty much the same, but it's a great way to pick up resources. The animal characters are more interactive, have more personality, and are fun to watch as they seem to do their own thing rather than walk around aimlessly. In spite of its flaws, there is something delightful and addictive about the game.\nSome fun bonuses: tarantulas are a bit easier to catch, you can uproot trees and just transplant them whole from other islands if you eat fruit first, and you can bring harder to find flowers in crossbred colors from other islands and transplant them on your island (this is rare however!). Also, after acquiring shoots from other islands, you can grow bamboo on your own island. This is a fun bonus, however, so far, I've visited about about 8-10 other islands and haven't seen another type of fruit other than my own and only came across bamboo once. My son has visited other islands about the same amount and has only seen one other type of fruit.\nAll in all, this game offers some pleasant entertainment and a nice escape from real life for a bit. I'm giving it sound 3 stars because the verdict is still out- I need to see how things develop before I decide if this was a fail or if it will unfold nicely over time. Overall, there is some disappointment and frustration, but the positives are worth noting so I can't pan it. Hopefully, as time passes and updates are made available, we'll be pleasantly surprised, but until then, I'm not going to gush about this game.\n\nEdited 3/27: I'm going to add another half star to one star. Things are picking up and there are more fun bonuses we've discovered as a family as we've played. The other players still don't have as many diy plans as the original player and they've missed out on some things because of their status in the game, but those things become less important as the game progresses. A few still cause issues but we're hoping that will be fixed in the future. In the meantime, there are a lot of things that make this game worth playing and it's easy to see the incredible work that was put into creating the game. So. . . For our family of six, we're currently giving it 3.5 to 4 stars after one week of consistent game play.\nEdited 4/21: Plan on having to spend a LOT of time to get the necessary DIY recipes to create furniture. The game is designed to absolutely need an online connection and to play with friends so you can get every type of fruit, flower, DIY recipe, etc. Count on months and months of consistent playing in order to unlock a few things to decorate your house unless you catalog with other players. Count on a lot of repeat DIY recipes you won't need, few furniture options for long periods of time, and count on having to track down other players in online forums in order to catalog items or share resources because there is no other reliable method of getting what you need. I don't like my kids playing with strangers or inviting strangers into our island (I didn't in past AC versions and we did just fine) and I don't have friends who are playing so this puts families like mine in a difficult situation. I appreciate that there were more options in past AC versions for people who didn't want to do a lot of online play but it seems ACNH depends very much on online interaction and help. Hopefully some future updates will remedy this. In the the meantime, our score remains at around 3.5 to maybe 4 stars.",

It works don't get me wrong.... it can virtually eliminate all recoil. Aim assist is not what you think it is (while using pc mouse and keyboard) aim assist for this device basically just tricks your computer to thinking your mouse is a controller.\n\nDownsides:\n1. While looting/menus you can't use your mouse to click around you have to use wasd which is super annoying. (Meaning u can move while looting.....)\n2. You have to setup individual profiles for guns, scopes and barrels, or it won't function 100% accurate\n3. The device is simply pulling your aim in a certain pattern based on the weapon your using, so at mid range scoped you almost have aim bot. But at close range from the hip it drags your aim to the ground. At longer ranges your fighting to understand how its compensating almost more than you would just playing regular.\n4. Aim assist: if you are roughly a platinum player who can average 1500 damage a game... the aim assist will impact you more negatively then positive. It slows your aim your nearing your target to be \"stickier\" which due to your hundreds of hours of muscle memory this will cause you to under correct and you'll be fighting the aim assist to land shots. If you are really bad at aiming.... have a less than 1.5 k/d/a and are typically stuck in silver or lower this will likely help you alot.\n\nI'm sure with alot more tinkering it would be more user friendly. But out of the box and doing 2 hours of setup and 4 hours of gaming. It wasn't worth it for me.... minor annoyances just outweighs the pros.\n\nThat said if you are buying this for use with a controller. You won't have any of the mouse and keyboard annoyances and it likely will work wonders for you.\n\nBut after 18 seasons of apex it's to much effort to retrain everything my brain knows about aiming, looting, menus and commands to likely get 5% better gameplay.",

I just want my kb and mouse to function like a pc on a ps5. I use a Razer keyboard and a Razer naga left handed mouse. My only grip, beside setup and initial tuning is sometimes the mouse freezes. Takes a couple seconds to get it back, meanwhile I’m stuck staring at the horizon or ground hoping I don’t catch a round. But it’s somewhat rare and usually just unplugging it resets it and it runs ok. I haven’t had anyone guess I’m one handed and those that I do tell are usually quite surprised I play as well as I do. Which is still marginal at best.\nWould I recommend it? Yes, if you’re in a similar situation and you can’t physically use a controller all that well. Otherwise I don’t know if it’s worth the headache and expense when you can learn to use a controller as effectively or better than kb&m.",
                "5": "Funciona muy bien es importante descargar Discord para unirse a los grupos que tienen scripts y poderlos instalar se debe seguir unos pasos sencillos para actualizarlo y configurarlo esto no es para alguien que crea que es solo conectarlo al ps5 y va hacer magia esto es de perderle tiempo mirando videos en YouTube para sacarle provecho",

                "7": "Alright I am reviewing this from a PC standpoint because it says it will work with PC. It is Terrible on PC and the recoil control is terrible. On console I have no idea but on PC it doesn't work. In addition, if you are using this for the console you do need a computer to download the game packs required. When I use it on PC it basically turns my inputs into controller inputs in Apex legends even though I am using keyboard and mouse.",
                "8": "Works amazing",
                "9": "I purchased the Cronus Zen with high hopes for enhancing my gameplay, attracted by its promising features. Initially, the device worked well for about a month, but soon after, it stopped responding and couldn't connect to the Zen Studio. I invested several hours in troubleshooting, following online guides and watching YouTube tutorials, but it's still not working.\n\nMy disappointment stems not only from the malfunctioning unit but also from the warranty coverage. The device cost $100, which felt reasonable for its potential benefits. However, it became faulty just 45 days after purchase. While Amazon's warranty covers only 30 days, the manufacturer's website offers a longer warranty of 90 days to a year, which doesn't help in my case.\n\nThe most disheartening part of this experience was not being able to fully explore and customize the device to my gaming needs. I had looked forward to diving into tweaking scripts and personalizing my experience, but the early failure of the unit cut that journey short. Overall, my experience with the Cronus Zen has been underwhelming and not worth the investment",
                "10": "Works great easy setup and once you set it up it’s very simple just plug it in and use the script you want. Only knock on it is that some people have very tough times setting it up. Which may cause trouble for less tech savvy people, and you will also need a pc in order to even set it up.",
                "11": "I'm not a big fan of this product. I bought it to test it with some games, and it does work as intended once you find the right game-specific downloads. However, finding these downloads can be a hassle as it involves navigating different user forums, websites, and content creators to locate the most up-to-date software.\n\nFor avid gamers, you'll know that gun sensitivities in games change frequently. This means Chrome Zen would need constant updates to accommodate these changes. Additionally, if you expect this product to make you invincible due to recoil reduction, that's not entirely accurate. It can be challenging and complicated to switch between sensitivities.\nI found the most effective way to use this was to create a universal recoil reduction setting for both my guns and characters. It takes time to fine-tune the amount of recoil reduction and the direction (left or right) you prefer."

                "1": "It works great. Easy to use, it charges fast and is lightweight and portable",
                "2": "I've had this charging station for 4-5 months at this point and I have nothing bad to say. Charges batteries fast, battery life is some of the best I've ever had for a controller battery pack. I will also note I am very cautious about taking the batteries off the charger as soon as they show green (fully charged) in order to not risk over-charging and draining. So I can't say as to whether they'd start to break down if you are not so careful. But as is, a few months in, this is easily the best battery pack + charging station I've purchased, well worth the inexpensive cost!",
                "3": "So far working great, long life before it needs a recharge and haven't had them too long, but haven't noticed any degrading with the recharging so far.",
                "4": "Warning: Does not come with wall outlet. Standard USB A to USB C cable included.\n\nI was tired of running through batteries every week. I thought I'd try one of these. The battery life is not quite as good as I'd hoped, but around 18 hours of gaming time isn't bad.\nThe battery pack lasts about 2/3rds as long a regular alkaline. And will charge rapidly. (Around 2 hours.)\nInserting the pack is simple once you figure out the trick. Insert the wedge end first at an angle, then slide the slot end into the groove. It's a tight fit, but goes in smoothly once you don't try putting in both ends at once.\n\nAll in all, it's pretty much exactly as described, even has a power switch on the back. I'd give it 4.5 stars, but I decided on 4 after reviewing the product description again and not finding anything stating you need a power plug. It's compact and easy to use. But the lack of a power plug is annoying and disappointing, especially when one of the product photos shows an integrated plug.",
                "5": "These are the best rechargeable batteries for controllers. We use them for Xbox controllers and get great long use out of them. No issues charging or using them.",
                "6": "Cheaper then replacing batteries! The charge on them lasts about 6-7 hours of USE! Takes about 3-4 hours to fully charge! Simple and easy to trade out! Can only fit one way in controller and one way in the charger! Save your self money and invest in this!",
                "7": "They charge very quickly and fit perfectly in any Xbox controller post 360. They are well-built and hold a lot of charge. For the money, they cannot be beaten. Four batteries at this amperage with a charger is usually much more expensive. Also, one of my favorite features is that they can actually fit underneath the detachable battery cover on the Xbox controller. With battery packs which are too big for the dust cover, I end up needing to set aside the cover and losing it.",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "I been avid Kirby fan since SNES, called Super Family Computer back in my country. I have played almost every release of HAL Laboratory's pink creation, almost with passion. Kirby Superstar always was one of my favorite Nintendo 1st party title. But as I got older and I moved onto PS2 and GBA, fact Kirby stayed 2D even when Mario was getting 2.5 and 3D treatment was slowly baffling me.\n\nThen, one day, for GameCube, a E3 demo surfaced. One that featured my favorite pink cute creature, running around saving Dream Land! I was awed! I loved it! I really wanted it! It would have given me reasons to buy GameCube, which I held off on, because I was getting distant from Zelda titles (which I still care 0 for), and only game I grew interest in became MGS Twin Snakes, which I highly recommend.\n\nI waited forever for the title to release.\n\nFrom 2005, we fast-forward, now we're here.\n\nNow, I'm fully aware this game has been built from the scratch, not related to this beautiful game at all. And it's long been confirmed that the GCN and possible Wii edition that it may have existed all went in dumpster only after being in development hell for 11 years. BUT. YOU HAVE NO FREAKING IDEA HOW MUCH THE WORLD NEEDED THIS GAME. Every platformer copy steal ability game lands itself beautifully to our wonderful pinkball here.\n\nAnd Kirby is here to rightfully take that back from you. Or suck it out of you.\n\nRight out of the box, game plays short cutscene and there's 0 punch holding. You're taken straight into the tutorial, reminded of the familiar controls.\n\nAnd then WHAT?! I CAN BE A CAR KIRBY NOW?!\n\nAnd the area can beautifully demolishable just as how previous Kirby games have been, has platform area that you can fall and oof into, just as previous Kirby games have been, but this formula finally got re-perfected in the name of our Holy Pinkness finally fit for the generation that only knows Kirby as that Super Smash Bros. character that is annoying to fight against.\n\nNow I will add back that I have only been playing for about 1h, but this new game almost plays like a journey. You're finding out conspiracy on how you ended up in this Forgotten Land, accompanied by beautiful Japanese song (that probably is definitely the first one!), great orchestra-based OST, and did I mention that Car Kirby is freaking adorable? I heard he has few or form and I'm very eager to find out rest of them.\n\nIf you're long fan of older Kirby titles, I am wondering why you're reading my reviews instead of already snagging this title. It feels like nothing new for first few minutes, but that's some of the beauty of the Kirby series. The gameplay feels like something you can jump back into almost any time, even if you haven't played Kirby game since Kirby Superstar. But there's enough new tricks introduced to keep you busy and wondering around the new Forgotten Land for good few hours. Considering last Kirby title was fairly short and took me only about 3 days of casual play to get near 100% completion, I'm hoping this one has far more to offer, which it already has. If you played a lot of platformer, this new Kirby title will keep you busy some time, it got some easy puzzles and here and there moment of \"wait why is that there?!\" moments.\n\nI think I mentioned Car Kirby is freaking cute already? Lol.\n\nSo far, 100/100. I haven't had so much fun with games lately, and this one definitely hits the spot. I love you Kirby. And please don't let my spouse find out I'm cheating on them over Kirby.",
                "2": "irby and the Forgotten Land is a delightful addition to the beloved Kirby series. The game follows Kirby as he explores a mysterious new land and restores its lost colors, battling enemies and using his signature ability to inhale and copy their abilities along the way.\n\nOne of the standout features of Kirby and the Forgotten Land is its vibrant, colorful graphics. The game's environments and characters are beautifully animated, with a wide range of colors and effects that really bring the game to life. The game's soundtrack is also a highlight, with a mix of upbeat tunes and soothing melodies that perfectly complement the action on screen.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Kirby and the Forgotten Land offers a good balance of challenge and accessibility. The game's controls are intuitive and responsive, making it easy to navigate the levels and defeat enemies. Kirby can also use a variety of power-ups and abilities, such as the new \"Link\" ability that allows him to team up with enemies and use their abilities together. The game also includes a multiplayer mode, allowing up to two players to team up and explore the Forgotten Land together.\n\nAnother nice touch in Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the inclusion of hidden collectibles and secrets to discover. Throughout the game, players can find hidden treasures and unlockable content, adding an extra layer of replayability to the game.\n\nOne minor issue I had with the game was the somewhat repetitive nature of some of the levels. While the game does introduce new enemies and challenges as you progress, some of the early levels can feel a bit same-y after a while. However, this is a minor complaint, and overall the game is still very enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Kirby and the Forgotten Land to fans of the series, as well as anyone who enjoys platforming games. The game's charming story, vibrant graphics, and fun gameplay make it a must-play for fans of the pink puffball. Whether you're a seasoned Kirby veteran or a newcomer to the series, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is sure to provide hours of enjoyment.",
                "3": "I am a huge Kirby fan and have been with the series since 2002. I was left somewhat disappointed with Kirby Star Allies as I felt it was lacking in some key areas. It felt like a decent game however one that played things overly safe. With Kirby and the Forgotten Land HAL Labs have finally made the leap into 3d and it's better than I could have ever imagined.\n\nKirby controls excellently in 3d. Everything has been adapted into 3d in a way that feels natural. The camera is mostly fixed with some minor angling that can be done by the player. The levels themselves are consistently creative and enjoyable to play. There's a load of additional content ranging from mini games to the bonus treasure road stages in each world. The music is also fantastic! These are some of my favorite level and boss themes in the series thus far.\n\nIn terms of complaints I only have a few and they're minor at best. The game runs at 30fps. It's a stable framerate however it is disappointing when compared to other games on the switch that are more technically demanding and run at higher framerates. In addition objects that are not immediately in your vicinity are rendered at half the framerate which wouldn't be an issue if the game ran at 60fps. It's just jarring to see enemies and items rotating at a choppy 15fps and on the whole it's a tad disappointing given how good the rest of the game looks.\n\nSecondly the number of powers is fairly small. There are only 12 which is less than the typical Kirby game which has around 20-25. The saving grace is that abilities can be upgraded which makes a lot of them feel unique. There's also some surprising omissions in terms of copy abilities such as no Wheel, Parasoul, Spark, Beam or Fighter.\n\nLastly I wish that the worlds had just a few more stages. Most worlds have on average 4 stages with a few containing 5 excluding the boss stages. The levels themselves are fantastic but I guess I'm being a little greedy because I wish there were a few more.\n\nOverall this is an easy recommendation. I think those looking for a relaxing platforming adventure will enjoy this a lot. Anyone on the fence can always try out the free demo for this game located on the Nintendo Switch E-Shop. I love Kirby as a series and I can't wait to see what HAL Labs does next!",
                "4": "Arrived as described, its my first time playing a Kirby game. Its such a fun, aesthetically pleasing and relaxing to play game and is definitely one of my top favorites now. I love open world games where you can run around and explore. To me it feels similar to Mario Odyssey with the different worlds/locations to unlock, collect coins, figures, different helmets and save the waddle dees. The game is not too easy and some are very challenging which I love. Its a must have game!",
                "5": "I'll admit that I bought this game for myself as much as I did for my 5-year old. I've loved Kirby since the original Kirby's Dream Land on the Game Boy (yes, I'm that old), played several of the titles since, and I think this was the best one yet. It's a little more mature and better suited for an adult who just wants to play a fun, light game, but still presents a challenge.\n\nI played it all the way through to 100% completion on the harder mode. In order to get that 100%, you have to do some pretty challenging tasks, like defeat every boss without taking any damage, including the final boss, serve food at the snack shop in town to angry, impatient customers (much harder than you'd think a side mini game should be), catch a giant fish, and go through the hardest setting in the battle arena. It's one of those games that isn't so impossibly hard that it's frustrating, but presents enough of a challenge that it feels like an accomplishment.\n\nI also played it through, though not to 100%, with my 5-year old daughter. She has played Mario Kart and Mario Party in the past, but this was very different. She and her 3-year old brother both loved it. It has the perfect \"little helper\" mode where you can have Bandana Waddle Dee join Kirby to assist, but other than going through doors, player 2 can't actually get in the way or cause any trouble. If they stray too far or fall behind, Bandana Waddle Dee just gets teleported right back next to Kirby. If he gets injured, Kirby can give him a high five to give back some health (with a recover period), and if he dies, he just gets a short time out and then player 2 can jump right back into the game. It was a great experience for her, as a learner, to get the idea or how game control works and moving in 3D space.\n\nThere is a decent story line that goes along with the game and my sensitive 3-year old was actually quite upset with first ending because you don't fully rescue everyone. Several hours after my daughter and I finished the game, he was crying hysterically (\"I don't like the end of Kirby!\") after I had put him to bed because he was so upset about this. Fortunately, I was able to convince him that it wasn't completely over and we would finish it out and get that final rescue in a couple of days.",
                "6": "I am a Nintendo fan but never thought much about Kirby games. Because I now have younger kids, I am often searching for games that are good for kids and families. I tried Kirby All Star Allies and liked it enough to give this one a try after reading reviews.\n\nI am so impressed. They put together a masterpiece that I think my kids and me will remember for a long time. Playing Co-op works very well. Both players get a fulfilling sense of involvement. The game is filled with very cleverly designed stages and concepts. It’s not the hardest game, because that’s not the point. The point is to have fun, explore, and enjoy the experience.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Kirby can pick up various powers that offer a lot of variety in the gameplay. New to this game is “mouthful mode” where you suck up various larger objects and this creates more unique styles of gameplay (as one example, you can become a soda can vending machine that spits out cans to hurt enemies… and that’s just one of many clever concepts that will leave you smiling ear to ear).\n\nAnother really cool thing is Waddle Dee Town. As you save these tiny Waddle Dee creatures, your town gets populated and new things get built. The town is empty at first. Before you know it, you have a cinema, a fishing pond, and various other areas that can keep you entertained and smiling. When I was a child, I played a version of Asteroids where after every few levels the astronaut would return to earth and each time something would be added. Like first no one was there to greet him. Towards the end there was a fancy car and parade. The graphics were so rudimentary but to this day I still remember the experience. Kirby and the Forgotten Land recreates that. I think it’s a game me and my kids will always remember and cherish. I will also mention that while the story is typical Nintendo silly fun, the later stages really draw you in and have you fully invested.\n\nThis is a must own for any Nintendo fan.",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "First, these headsets are great for those who use PC or Xbox One to game. I'm sure they can be used on anything that has a jack-in port.\n\nSide note for Xbox users: Don't get the dongle version of this headset if you have an Xbox One Gen 1. The USB ports don't work with any dongle devices.\n\nAs long as I've been gaming, I've never invested in headphones. As far as first pairs go, I think it serves its purpose.\n\nThe volume isn't the greatest, but I can't say if that's because of Xbox One, Discord settings, or the headphones itself. I don't mind that it has 0 noise-canceling features because it's safer that way. I've learned that noise-canceling devices can eliminate your awareness in emergencies (like if a family member needs help, or a fire happens in the house, etc.). While I know that it's unlikely those things will ever happen for some people, I live in a rough neighborhood where it pays to have all your senses present. Honestly, I can hear my friends just fine with them, but the unit doesn't have an eardrum-shattering volume. Probably for the best.\n\nI really like the way the set can be adjusted at the ear muff parts and at the head strap. I also appreciate that the mic can be turned off by just flipping the piece up. The way that the ear parts encapsulate my ears is also a nice feature. It's very plush, which is great for my sensitive ears. I can't use ear devices that insert into my ears--it causes massive pain in under 10 minutes, so having a device that never touches my ears, lets me play longer. The head strap is also a nice feature because it prevents the hard plastic portion from sitting on my head. If you've ever had the weight of a headset sit on your head for long periods of time, you know how much it can hurt.",
                "2": "I had the Astro A10's for a few years and this last week they crapped out on me. Was going to get another set of A10's but the reviews for the gen 2's weren't that great, and these Logitech's had better reviews. Logitech owns Astro and I know both companies have great quality so I thought what the heck. These are super light weight and comfortable to wear. I can't say anything about the mic because I don't talk at all when gaming. The only complaint that I have (for now) is they lack bass. My A10's had some decent bass when playing Call of Duty and even watching YouTube with the headphones to be quiet. I really like these, but wish they had more bass. Maybe there's a way to turn it up but I haven't been able to find those settings yet.\n\nLong story short, these are a great buy and work perfectly.",
                "3": "I would say this is a really good headset for the price.\n\nComfortable even with glasses.\nThe fabric is nice on the ear cups. Never buying that fake leather crap that peals off and gets in my hair and all over the place.\nMic boom is nice. Super handy to push it up and mute quickly. Good sound quality on the mic too.\n\n2 negatives I found\nCord length is too short. Just needs another 2 feet.\nThey say these are discord certified. But there are instances where I was playing a video that was playing through the headset and the mic was picking up the sound and playing it back. I have it on voice activity and automatic input sensitivity. The fix is either lowering the volume on what I am watching or turn off automatic input and set the db level my self but that sometimes does not work and I can get cut off because I talk with a low voice. Sometimes it stops doing this if I push the mic further away from my face.\n\nThis is a five star headset but I am bringing it down to 4 only because they say this headset is discord certified but the mic playback tells me they don't certify nothing and it's just a paid partnership marketing scam. I really don't think they \"certify\" these headsets.\n\nOther then that the headset is great and I am enjoying it a lot. It's way more comfortable then my last headset. If you want a comparison to the HyperX Could wireless headset read below.\n\nWhen compared to the HyperX Cloud I, not the Cloud II. Both side by side have the same sound and mic quality. But Logitech headset wins on comfort. The Cloud headset lost it's durability on the band so the headset did not grip my head anymore and would slip off my head all the time.\nEar cups on the HyperX would peel off and get everywhere. Logitech is fabric with nice memory foam. Much prefer logitech ear cups. Super comfy.\nThe mic on the HyperX had no issues and really liked that mic. I would say HyperX mic is better only because the discord playback issue I have with logitech is sometimes annoying.\nHyperX wireless, I would say wireless headsets are worth. The fact that I can stand up and go to my kitchen while still talking and listening in discord is great.\nI do miss that about being wireless.\nWith wired ones you have to set it down and stop the conversation to check on something.\nI would say get this headset but wireless.\n\nBest value Logitech\nBest quality HyperX\nBest comfort - Logitech\nBest durability - N/A still need to wear logitech for a little longer to find out.",
                "4": "I bought this for my friend for his birthday, and while he continues raving about the quality of the sound; we appreciate the quality of the mic. The background noise such as fans and animals are no longer picked up for him and we can always hear him clearly. Unfortunately it doesn't have a \"chewing sound\" cancellation. User error on that one that.\n\n11/10, would recommend",
                "5": "Pros:\n- LONG battery life. From a full charge, logged 9hrs while working from home and had 77% battery the next day. Great for those who may not be using this headset on a daily basis (or those who are and forget about charging daily!).\n- USB-C charging connectivity (A to C cable supplied, high quality, long length).\n- Lightspeed dongle is small and discrete.\n- Comfort: (YMMV... I'm a male in mid 20s with a medium sized head... I think?) after a few days of playing around with the ski band placement and earcup position, I finally found a setup that worked for me. I have stud earrings and found some higher positions of the earcups were originally pressing on my lobes and causing some discomfort. Switching the band to the larger position and bringing the earcups down allowed me to seat everything nicely without any discomfort. Wore the headphones all day while working from home and forgot I wasn't wearing my usual headphones (Beyerdynamic DT770... Which are my top choice for headphone comfort).\n- Logi GHub connectivity/customizations are decent. Simple volume, mic volume, sidetone (hearing your voice thru mic with no latency), audio EQ customization (with presets and custom settings)\n- Doesnt look super \"gamer-y\"... a good plus if I need video on during a (professional) call.\n- Flip to mute mic is great. I dont like having to deal with a removable mic or a fixed mic. The hardware based muting of the G535 mic is convenient and easy and doesnt require much finger dexterity... Allows me to mute on Discord or Teams while AFK.\n- Volume wheel and power button are smartly and intuitively placed and sized. Only a couple times have I accidentally brushed the volume wheel with the hood of my sweatshirt, but this only clicks the volume up a notch or two.\n\nCons:\n- Noise cancelling is pretty weak. No active noise cancelling (but you wouldnt expect that at this price). Not much isolation from surrounding sounds, but this wasn't a large drawback for me as I play in relatively quiet environments\n- Mic quality: its a 2.4ghz wireless mic, so you have the usual downsides. Reduced high end, thinner bottom end. Its fine! But clarity suffers a little due to the intrinsic qualities of WIRELESS HEADSET technology. Please note that THIS MIC IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR GAMING, WORK CALLS, AND OTHER GENERAL COMMS PURPOSES!\n- Sound Quality: its fine! I do audio recording and mixing, so I'm biased when it comes to any set of headphones. My Beyerdynamic DT770 have a very wide soundstage, clear highs, articulated bass, and balanced mid range. I spend maybe 12 hours a day using the DT770s and love them for everything (aside from being wired). The G535 are fine for casual gaming, calls, video watching, and music listening. The default flat EQ is very acceptable, and I only tuned it a small amount to increase the high end, soften some mid range resonances, and add some weight in the low end. The stereo soundstage is a little muddy, but all wireless \"gaming\" headsets that I have tried in the past suffer from this- I would liken it to feeling like you are underwater and the sound is surrounding you equally and internally. Again, these headphones are PERFECTLY FINE for gaming, calls, video, and music. I wouldn't try to mix any audio, analyze new music, or try to take in a renowned movie soundtrack with this headset. Again I'm using my Beyerdynamic DT770s as reference here (the cadillac of headphones in my eyes)- they excel at being wired headphones with articulated qualities for music recording and mixing environments (and theyre great for CSGO with their better isolation qualities).\n- No bluetooth, but I have a pair of galaxy buds that I use with phone/laptop... And I can always throw the USB lightspeed dongle in my laptop and crack out the G535s!\n\nOverall verdict: The G535 are my first forray into wireless gaming headsets, and I am beyond impressed by what it offers (especially for $80 on sale)! It is adaptable to many head shapes and sizes (both youth and adult), has an incredible battery life, delivers good audio and mic quality for wireless headsets (better than cheaper $50 random brands), has great controls (both physical and software) without overwhelming the user or offering too much unnecessary functionality - very plug and play. I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone looking to make a worthwhile purchase without breaking the bank (say, the Gpro wireless).",
                "6": "The sound quality is great, the built material may feel clunky... Nevertheless, I suggest avoiding use the mic. It sounds too low, and my friends always had a hard time trying to hear me. (Compared to my Steel Series 7)",
                "7": "Anyone who rates these 4 or 5 stars doesnt know anything about headphones, or gaming headphones. I got these on sale for $85 after tax. So at a pretty good discount. I returned them.\n\nThe good: They are extremely comfortable. They felt great. And if thats your main concern give them a shot. You can always return. The band was adjustable with two notches, and I have a decent size head and ears. The phones themselves are adjustable on a slide, which wasnt bad either but I could see that breaking. I take really good care of my stuff however so this may vary. They are extremely light and are all or mostly plastic.\n\nThe bad: So on wireless headphone gaming headphones with a mic, sound usually isnt that great until you get up to 200 plus range, and still not comparable to most wired sets, but along with that caveat these are incapable of being \"loud\" either. The sound profile wasn't great but it was even below what I expected when I tested out a bunch of games.\n\nThe worst thing about these headphones is the mic, it sounds meh but it picks up EVERYTHING. This was the biggest reason for my return. You know those people you can hear their entire house? Ya they probably have something like these. If you are sitting next to your computer for example, it will pick up fan noise, mechanical keyboard? Ya it picks that up too. And I have one of the quiet ones. The mic pop wasnt as bad as I thought it would be, but a pop mic filter wont help either of these issues much, I stuck one on there.\n\nI also contacted logitech about these just to see if I could fix one of these issues, either with the mic or low sound. Its not possible. Basically got the auto response from them, of which I already did all those things before contacting them.\n\nThe battery didnt last long before I started seeing major dips in the charge but I didnt run them until dead. It didnt seem good however. But it could be inaccurate display of that on the top end of a full charge.\n\nThe wireless range was okay, its seemed accurate to what the product has listed. I could walk in most areas aside from the patio before it broke up.\n\nThere was a review on here that said, ya these are trash, and while I wouldnt got that far, I wouldnt tell anyone to get these. You can get WIRELESS headphones that are better for the price point. HyperX/Steelseries.\n\nIf you do get these, DO NOT buy full price, I felt uncomfortable at paying 85 after tax once I realized how they were. But at $100 its a rip off.\n\nEither go wired or save for a better pair, if you want decent sound or mic, definitely pass on these. Im not an audiophile I didnt apply that level of scrutiny but if I did these would be 1 or 0 star aside from comfort.",
                "8": "Bought my headset back in Jan 2023. They've worked very well canceling out noises, projecting game volume, and picking up my voice.\nUnfortunately, they seem to have a lifespan of about 10 months - that's when my mic started not picking up my voice every time I'd turn it on, and now randomly stops projecting any sound - and at the same time turning my voice very digitized in vc (assuming my mic was working).\n\nKinda was hoping they'd last a lot longer for this price though",
                "9": "As a gamming wireless headset Logitech does a good job. One gripe, the headband is at max and it's snuggly comfortable with no other expansion option. I have a big head, but the only adjustment is the inside top head strap which has 2 positions. Mine is at largest and like I said snuggly comfortable, I can live with it but a larger adjustment range would have been appreciated. Logitech usually does a super job, and I have no problem with their wireless mouse's, headset even keyboard. Other brands have been problematic. I drop the keyboard wireless for a wired mechanical gamming one but that was my choice. You usually can't go wrong with Logitech.",
                "10": "Haven’t use it personally but I heard it great . Sound quality is superb while the mic on the other hand is 2nd class. But overall great gift for someone"

                "1": "Recently, I purchased a Victrix BFG Pro. I was skeptical, especially with it lacking vibration. I was borderline not considering it, mostly just because of that. After a few articles showing that Victrix will be adding Hall Effect Sticks in Q1 2024. Price being 40 (USD) for a pair. That's incredible pricing. So awesome upgrade. This matters because I also have a SCUF Instinct Pro Wireless (worst), Razer Wolverine Ultimate (my backup), and my new baby Victrix BFF Pro. Stock, the SCUF comes with no Hard Case. Just the basic swaps for D pad and Sticks. I had to purchase the Hard Case EXTRA, for like 40 or 50, I believe. It came with an additional cord, some additional stick top. And other little stuff. Starting left to right again, The hard case is a nice color grey and the inside is textured and looks great. It's the thinnest of the cases and for one that was paid extra in addition to the most expensive controller of the bunch at 200$ (prices are rough memory estimates). The case for the Victrix is ever so slightly thicker and only noticable if you have them side by side. Both would protect a drop in almost all cases. Inside, the Victrix has a top pocket for the EXTREMELY NICE Purple braided cord (type C to Standard USC). Also has stacked Styrofoam layers of tools and replacement parts, which includes the additional fighting pad that can be swapped with the right joy and button combo pad on the right side of the controller. The next up is the VERY sturdy and thick case. Inside is the pocket up top for the cord and the bottom houses the replacement D pades and sticks (which are held on by high power magnets and is the best setup of the three). With the information given, you'd be understandable in thinking that the SCUF was the worst of the bunch. In price? Sadly, yes. In usability? Hell no. The SCUF is my favorite to use. The reverse button placement is perfect *FOR ME*. Durability wise? Horrible, don't buy, trash, borderline a scam. Not only is SCUF already known for that, it turns out this first of the better QC lot was in fact, crap. Within the first 3 months I had to have it in for a faulty button and faulty bumper. Not a quick process since it's inconvenient to have no controller. Thankfully I'm a nerd lol. Got it back and all was golden. Then after a few months, the same button and bumper started not registering clicks either. Not every time. Just 1/10 I'd say. But you would be shocked how much is messed you up lol. Now, sitting at 14 months with it? Not great at all. 2 buttons. 1 bumper. 1 trigger. All faulty. Never dropped. No liquid anything. Kept literally in a hard case whenever it wasn't in use. I play a few hours a week total so this is minimal use. Terrible product. They will fix it. But I gotta pay for shipping and the full repair. So I'm stuck. Worst 400$ I've ever spent on controller and extras. The Victrix is so awesome. I have medium to medium/large hands lol. Not huge. They are on the CUSP of being too small. Which makes them perfect for me, but it might not be for my bigger brethren out there. I have not noticed the lack of vibration a SINGLE TIME. I even tried to pay attention for it and still didn't notice it. So I guess that's neat lolol. It feels light yet sturdy. It's what you would want for long sessions. Light weight and upgradable/repairable. Victrix doesn't sell replacements of anything yet, that I've noticed. But everything points to Q1 for the start of all that. I've been XBOX my whole life so my brain is struggling with the PlayStation symbols. Sell the XB setup for extra. Just a different single paddle. I'd be so happy. This is my go to by a mile. The Razer Wolverine Ultimate is a wonderful controller. The button placement on the back is TERRIBLE. That's all personal preference so I won't knock it for it. Build is solid. Can't speak for other products of theirs. It's very heavy in comparison. By a chunky margin. But it works great. Feels great. Way cheaper in price but not quality at all. They did a great job with that line. So I'd say\n\nSCUF - 6\nVicxtrix - 9\nRazer - 7.5/8",
                "2": "So I'll start with the best and main feature: The modular face. I can't stress how awesome this thing is for players like me that struggle to find button/dpag/analog setups that work for the way we like to play. For example, I play claw style, so having the 6-button option is a must. Need to go back to play a game where 4-button makes more sense? No problem, just swap the pieces, which is super easy. And those units can be flipped, so for instance, I like the dpad in the top-left most position (by default, that's where the analog stick is, like what you see in the picture), so I simply flipped it. When I'm playing, I also hate having the analog stick in the way, again, no problem, just pops right off (and you get extras).\n\nThis modular feature is important because if you play enough, eventually buttons and dpads go out. For a long time, I was using the Hori FC4 (original design), which was a great controller and fairly inexpensive, but the one drawback was that it broke down pretty fast. Pro players that use the dualshock will tell you they replace them every several months, at most. Although I haven't seen it yet, I have to imagine that Victrix will sell the face pieces separately, which will eventually not only give players like me the ability to easily and cheaply replace wornout components, but it opens the door for more designs for those pieces in the future.\n\nOtherwise, it has a bunch of other premium features. You can go wired, which for many of us is really important, and the wire is nice and sturdy. Same with the case for the controller and all the various pieces to it. It has a built-in feature to program (or turn off) the back-grip buttons, and multiple profile options, so even though there is an app that allows for more input customization (which is also a rad feature), you don't need that to do some basic input customization. It also has built-in trigger stops, which is amazing, and a tournament mode to disable your system buttons and the touchpad. The pad has a nice, heavy weight to it, too.\n\nBefore I got this thing, it was clear it was designed for tournament play in mind. The question I had was whether the dpad(s) would be any good. I use the old, basic, Nintendo cross-style and so far it's working really well. All of the other features, too, are highly-desirable when in a tournament setting, and they function great. But, they went beyond that to ensure that if you want to use it like a normal, casual controller, you clearly can.\n\nSo I'll say that at this point it seems the wait was worth it, but I'll end with a caveat: This isn't a casual controller. The price tag should probably tell you that, but I can easily see certain people being disappointed with this thinking it's going to be good for casual use. You really have to be thinking about a competitive setting to see the value you're getting with this pad's features. This controller is comparable in quality to something like the Razer Wolverine v2 but has way better features for competitive play and practice, yet the Wolverine is $70 more. I've used the Victrix for casual gaming already and I can tell you it works great there, too, but unless you're taking advantage of all the features that a non-competitive game *isn't* going to use, then this is probably too expensive.\n\nUltimately, a fantastic controller.\n\nEDIT: The Victrix Control Hub now works with the BFG, so that eliminates one criticism I had. Now the only thing left for them to address is replacement parts for the modular pieces. This could be make or break though: I've asked them about this and for now even requesting parts directly is not an option. The clock is ticking on that because when everyone starts to have breakdowns, no one is paying for a brand new BFG when a piece that should be really replaceable can't be replaced. That's going to wreck this thing's reputation.",
                "3": "The Good: This is by far the most responsive, decisive controller I've ever purchased, with excellent remappable buttons for all buttons and triggers, not just the typical 4 buttons, Triangle, Circle, X, and Square PS style, or A, B, X, Y. The 2 triggers used for driving games (Rocket League) can be adjusted to the level of depression as well, which makes dribbling in Rocket League much easier (I play Rocket League Primarily). The joysticks are extremely easy to move, making sharp turns the fastest I've ever been able to accomplish, which is very important in Rocket League to cut off the ball, or turn fast when close to the ball. The included accessories and case are top notch. The dongle for PC eliminates the need for Bluetooth pairing, which is a great plus, as pairing Bluetooth constantly and issues with that is eliminated as well.\n\nThe Bad: The thumb grips on the control sticks could use a more rubbery surface to prevent thumb slippage while maneuvering fast, this is a problem with almost all controllers really on the market. Also, the controller is made for small to average sized hands sadly, as that's the biggest issue I have with it. I have very large hands, and the ends of the grips end in the middle of my palms versus a full grip that the Sonicon controller which is much larger than a standard PS4/5 controller that fits my hands superbly. If the PDP Victrix Pro BFG was made at least 1/3rd larger in size, it would accommodate the hands of more people, particularly adults who would be the primary purchaser of such an expensive controller, but well worth it due to the GOOD that I previously mentioned. I'd gladly pay 50 dollars more or even higher for a larger controller exactly like this present one. I hope other companies follow Sonicon's lead in making controllers larger, as smaller controllers with back paddles that can be remapped are out of place for those of us with medium to larger sized hands.\n\nOverall: This is easily the best controller I've ever purchased, even with it size issue, I'm learning to place my hands to make it work. Grip extenders do not work sadly, as the shape of the grips being angular rather than round, do not fit and come off shortly after applying. Perhaps they could make a version with the ability to extend the grips by an add on would help solve the problem for large handed individuals, but that wouldn't address the buttons being smaller or the placement of the back paddles which would still be out of place. The real solution would be to make this same controller, just in a larger size for big handed individuals. Till someone does address this issue, like Sonicon did (my previously favorite controller due to its size and responsiveness), I'll have to deal with the current market's limitations on their smaller sized controllers.\n\nUpdate: It's JUST TOO SMALL! I cannot adapt to this tiny controller built for children obviously or small adults. Playing Rocket League I'm constantly backflipiping due to the buttons being too close together for my larger than a child's sized thumb. Very frustrating trying to make it work, but in the end, this controller is flat out too small to use effectively for an adult, unless you have puny hands and fingers. The search for an adult sized excellent controller for Rocket League continues sadly. On to the next.",
                "4": "I have used this controller for 130 days. The date of this review is 19 JUN 2023. I received this controller on 10 FEB 2023.\n\nThere are serious problems with this controller:\n\n1. Stick Drift: The stick drift progressively has gotten worse. At first, I was able to set my right stick dead-zone to 6%. After 60 days it had to be adjusted all the way up to 28%. This is where it's been at ever since. I noticed that even at 28%, when the controller battery gets low, the stick drift will kick in once again and become quite severe to the point the controller is unusable for the remainder of battery life. After turning controller off and back on while recharging, the stick drift tends to stabilize somewhat.\n\n2. Audio I/O: There is no built-in microphone so using a headset with microphone is a must- if you want to talk. The battery life is indicated by a small battery indicater with 3 measures. All 3 full means fully charged, 2 means halfway charged, 1 means on low, and blinking means almost drained. If the controller is halfway charged (2 measures) or lower the audio starts cutting out and so does the microphone to the headset. I would actually say all peripheral devices connected to the controller start \"acting up\".\n\n3. Victrix Control Hub App Driver Conflict: Finally, as of June 2023, the \"VictrixCompatibility (1).reg\" file was released in support of the ongoing \"COULD NOT CONNECT – Victrix Control Hub App Driver Conflict\". So, enthusiastically, I ran the registry update and followed the instructions per PDP's help page. Success, the app finally recognized the controller and the Firmware was being installed- so I thought. Well, the firmware never installed and instead bricked my controller. I followed to the letter all the instructions. I did not disconnect the controller or even minimize the window. After 90mins of staring at my screen and seeing no status bar progress I disconnected the controller as it was obvious something was very wrong. The controller is bricked and does not respond to any button presses. The Victrix app doesn't even recognize the controller as connected. If you value having a working controller, do not use this app. Now, I'm stuck with a $200 Pro BFG paper weight.\n\nFor $200 I would not recommend this controller. The stick drift, lack of app support, audio I/O and battery bugs make this controller just completely unreliable. Usually, for this kind of money you would expect to have a top-shelf quality item. I have played everyday for many hours for the past 130 days and I can confidently say it is not a quality item that stands the test of time. It does not stand up to the expectation of stress and performance one would expect from a $200 item. Even the standard PS5 dual sense controllers are cheaper, non-customizable, and drain battery life quicker, yet they do not have these problems.",
                "5": "Controller is S-tier in almost every category of things.\n\nI'm going to go over the incredibly short list of cons before I go over the list of pros;\n- won't turn on your PS5 (you can use your TV remote if you have a TV from this decade).\n- currently doesn't have an app or software, so you have to change button configurations manually\n\nNOW FOR THE LONG LIST OF PROS:\nThe ergonomics and overall design/engineering is honestly far superior to any other PS5 or even Xbox controller on the market. It is a HIGH QUALITY, WELL-DESIGNED controller meant for LONG SESSIONS or tournament play.\n- Configuring back buttons and profiles is super easy, so is everything else, I'll add a link on how to use all the features at the end of this review.\n- The back buttons feel better than any other controller I've ever held, to include the new Razer, the Scufs, the Elite Series 2 (which are my #2 favorite paddles now).\n- The D-Pads are wonderful, not loud and clicky like razers but have a nice muted feedback to them, I prefer the hybrid d-pad or the Victrix d-pad.\n- Super easy to swap out thumb sticks and modules and rotate them. Thumbsticks feel great, the longer one is impressive for FPS/TPS.\n- Triggers are sensitive, require very little actuation force. Super reactive, really a 10/10, trigger stops seem more like they have 3 stopping points than 5, but still super easy to use. Triggers are also textured for grip, but very soft.\n- The grips on the controller are perfect.\n- 2 Year warranty as opposed to other companies.\n- Customer support is better than any of the other companies who I've ordered controllers from.\n- l1/r1 buttons have a different feel than any other button on the controller, very similar to mouseclicks.\n- Controller is LIGHT. This will not hurt your hands after a 10 hour play session.\n\nEvery single button/stick/interface on this controller is designed with comfort and efficiency in mind.\nIt is SIGNIFICANTLY better than any other PS5 Pro Controller Alternative. Its ergonomics alone make it better than the Razer Pro (F-tier design, and FFF tier customer support). The Dualsense Edge only has two paddles, and a three hour battery life, which also make it an unworthy comparison. While SCUF's quality is nice, they have a 6-month warranty period, and are SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive. SCUF also modifies the DS5 as opposed to building a god-tier controller from the ground up.\n\nI've used this controller on both my PS5 and PC and must say that I've yet to experience a better controller.\n\nAnd this review is BEFORE they've even released the software for it. I can't wait to see what that's going to be like!\n\nLink to their instructions; https://support.pdp.com/hc/en-us/articles/11045034301325-Victrix-Pro-BFG-Wireless-Controller-for-PS5-PS4-and-PC-User-Guide",
                "6": "Pros: The controller is very comfortable, it has great d-pad options & the diamond d-pad itself is the best I ever used; the buttons feel nice on press too. It's great for PC and the Steam app. The case it comes with is very good; I love the fact that you can switch around controller styles & you can make the analog sticks have octagon gates. It was built with many different types of people in mind. I like the fact that this controller was designed & intended for the type of people who don't want to switch between 2 or more different types of controllers to play a variety of games. This controller is very close to perfection in my opinion and Victrix could make the next installment even better if done with even more types of people in mind.\n\nCons: Too expensive, no bluetooth, it's very annoying when you have to use the screwdriver everytime you wanna change the style, and you can't remove the 4 back buttons when not in use. Out the box you'll see that the triggers are super sensitive and activates at times you dont want them to because you slightly pressed them. The software isnt helpful when it comes to the triggers; if you wanna play sfv or any 6-button fighting game, you can't make the R1 & R2 into L1 & L2. This is because as of the time of this review, you cant change what the trigger buttons do in the software app; this could be fixed with a simple update. THE MECHANISMS FOR THE TRIGGER LEVELSp ARE THE WORST DESIGN EVER!! It's annoying to change the trigger levels and a pain to set it to the middle level. Everytime I play a game my finger would accidentally touch/slide across the trigger switcher and it cause the trigger to reset to the default trigger position. In the software app I have the triggers set to activate at the very bottom of a press; so when the sensitive trigger mechanism gets touched & resets the triggers to the top position, the game wouldn't recognize my fingers pressing the triggers down unless I switched it back to the bottom position. When this happens while I play online in a fighting game, I have to stop playing and fix the triggers back to the position where the game will recognize it again; and while I'm fixing all this my opponent gets a bunch of free hits on my character. When this happens every time you begin to realize that this controller is unplayable unless you get rid of the trigger lock mechanism. I very much think this controller should have trigger locks but just not this specific one that this controller has built into it. This controller is too expensive for its flaws.\n\nOpinion:\nThis is a cool controller, the case along with the other accessories you get inside the box are all useful and it gives you alot to test with. The diamond d-pad is my favorite part about this controller, it just feels great when playing online in fighting games. I definitely want Victrix to make more fightpads in the future, but the software app customization should be more like 8bitdo and the trigger lock switches should be like the xbox elite controller. It's too expensive for the amount of flaws and frustration it causes. I thought this controller would be the fightpad to make me feel like I could stop searching for a perfect controller to use for fighting games, but that's not the case here. I did see a few youtuber reviews who also agree that this controller isn't worth the high price and that there are too many flaws. There are also tons of youtubers praising this controller and I just wanted to share my experience. I honestly think Victrix can improve on these flaws and make an even better controller in the future; I do like the options it offers but not the execution. For the current price you can probably find more affordable & less stressful options. In my attached review photo; the red controller next to the Victrix pro bfg is an Aliexpress controller that I got in June 2022 for $25-30. It has a great d-pad, the button presses are responsive and works with whatever fighting game you like; I highly recommend it, just search fightpad on Aliexpress and you should see it. At most this is not a bad controller it's just too expensive, if this controller was $100 or less and had the same issues, I probably wouldn't have written so much in this review tbh. If you don't wanna spend almost $200 for a fightpad, then I'm sure you can find cheaper alternatives.",
                "7": "Controllers are overpriced period. $200 is not worth having a few extra buttons and a trigger stop. With that said I do need the back paddles and this controller has those. Nice and light and has held up perfectly for the past 12 months without any drift or issues. I have it 5 stars but with I can turn on the system with the controller, you have to turn on the PS5 before using this. For less than $200, this is a great option. $150 would be a good price point though.",
                "8": "I have never used a scuf before and was pretty happy that it only took a couple minutes to get used to the paddles on the back. I still accidentally press them every once in a while but I chalk it up to a skill issue. I really like that everything can be remapped how you want it through the app. FYI you have to have access to Windows in order to update the controller and use wirelessly with the PS5. Overall definitely recommend this as oppose to the DualSense Edge, and its cheaper too!!",
                "9": "First off, if you play fighting games on pad, the Victrix is the best PS5 option currently. The Hori Octa Fighting Commander is fine in every way except for where it counts most - the D-Pad. It's way too small.\n\nThe Victrix BFG here, has a WAY better D-Pad that is also customizable per ones taste. The fight button module is rather clicky, as it should be. The extra back triggers/paddles can be a bit too easy to accidentally hit, or at least the lower 2 are - so I disabled them in the software. The software itself is kinda finicky, but I set it up once and never had an issue again.\n\nFor reference, I play Guilty Gear Strive, and so far I have made considerably less input errors on this pad compared to the Hori. 623 inputs always come out, although half circle inputs for supers can be finicky if I do them too fast (might be a me problem. I bound the back paddles to RC and dash Macros, and so far I haven't had any issues with hitting the wrong triggers.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to people who want a dedicated PS5 pad, although the price by itself can be hard to overcome if you just set it up for Fighting games and never swap modules like I do. This, I must give it 4 stars.",
                "10": "Pros: This is a pro controller that allows you to customize your game play like no other controller on the market. If you like to play PS version of controller you have that option. If you prefer Xbox style. You have that option. Arcade style you have that option as well! and software for updates to your controller. There's a button for PS and PC. PC will give you Xbox (A,B,X,Y) output on your screen.\n\nCons: Back buttons don't feel comfortable while playing. I find myself pushing them unnecessarily. I unmapped them since its easy to press them on accident."

But let's be honest, who cares?\n\nI personally enjoyed in the past the career mode. it has been 5-6 years since a major update. This year they introduced the possibility of selecting the training strategy. Good as a concept, but after you set it up, then it's over. It doesn't develop within the game. Does it work? Absolutely no. It is just an advertising strategy.\nVery disappointed. Every year they take five steps backward.

                "1": "These have been my go-to headphones for gaming and even for more general uses for over 2 years now. There were no compromises made with the making of these headphones, from the sound quality to the construction of the headphones themselves.\n\nThese manage to be some of the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn, no modifications necessary. The cord that connects from the headphones to the dongle is a bit shorter than I'd like, but the length of the USB dongle is plenty long enough to make up for it. It's notable that these headphones also have a detachable (albeit custom) cable. If a cable goes bad you can simply get a replacement and these would effectively last forever.\n\nThe sound by default is very flat for those who are looking for flat headphones. If you're not though, the bass sliders on the ears can be cranked up to boost the bass to the perfect desired amount. I use them maxed out all the time and it gives the perfect amount, even sounds good just for music. The surround sound button on the dongle distorts the sound a little, but that's to be expected. It provides a more immersive experience in gaming, and you can just as easily disable it as you can enable it when you're done. The dongle also allowed for the user to balance and and gamechat audio, so you can hear people in gamechat more clearly if you need. The gamechat audio is also at a lower frequency, sort of like radio quality, to allow for voices to be clearer. This is optional too, so if you want people to sound crisp and standard, you can set the gamechat to play through the standard game audio. No fancy drivers or programs necessary for any of this either, there's an optional HyperX app you can install on Windows, but it just makes it easier to identify the sound levels between the game and gamechat volume slider.\n\nIf these headphones have any weakness, it would probably be the microphone. It's rather quiet and not the best quality, even with the large pop filter on it. Mic quality is better when the headphones are connected to the computer directly through analog, but the USB connection makes the mic quality a little more muffled. If you don't need the microphone though, you can detach it, which I have done and gets it completely out of the way.\n\nThese headphones are in summation some of the best I've ever used as a complete package. They're durable, comfortable, sound great, and work great for gaming and even some light amounts of music listening and any other media consumption. For around $80 they do everything you could ask for.",
                "2": "Let me just start this off by saying I never leave reviews. I'm not very easily impressed. I usually buy something, receive it, and carry on with my day. However, I've had these for over two years now, and it only just recently dawned on me how much of an anomaly this headset has been compared to others I've had in the past. In the hundreds, if not thousands of hours I've used this headset for, not once has it ever consciously occurred to me that they're being worn while in use. You slap them on out of the box, adjust the earcups to your liking, and then forget they're there. These things are so damn comfortable that I regularly forget I'm wearing them when I leave my apartment to go do other activities. I can't sing its praises enough in terms of comfort, since it feels like wearing nothing at all once properly adjusted.\n\nAs for the sound quality, it's pretty damn good. I've never really been much of an audio snob, but this is more than sufficient if you're just looking for something with quality sound. I've used them for everything from games to podcasts, and there has never been an instance where I was underwhelmed in any capacity by the sound quality here. Absolutely zero complaints from me in this department. The noise cancellation is pretty good, too. I mean, it's not gonna completely tune out anything and everything, but background noise is definitely reduced. My apartment's AC is only about ten feet from my desk, and it gets to be decently loud at times. Though the noise from it is still noticeable when wearing them, it still becomes maybe 30% quieter; even at that close a range. Get sucked into a game, movie, podcast, or album wearing these, and you'll soon forget about any white noise going on in your immediate vicinity anyway. You can also buy HyperX's 7.1 surround sound USB adapter to beef up the sound a bit should you so choose, but I mainly use it for additional volume control and ease of use instead of the surround sound. Maybe I'm using it wrong, but it's just never worked for me.\n\nIf you're sometimes rough with your peripherals like me, you probably are looking for something that can take a bit more punishment than most. Rest assured you won't be disappointed here, because this thing's rock solid. Just off the top of my head, my Cloud Alpha has survived:\n\n-Being slammed in the heavy wooden door leading to my apartment\n-Being slammed in a car door\n-Being accidentally rolled over at least two dozen times by sixty pound steel office chair\n-Being tossed onto hardwood flooring when I missed my intended target of the couch more times than I can count\n-Being dropped six feet onto solid concrete\n-Being stepped on at least two hundred different times\n-Being vomited on on more than one occasion, though that can probably be attributed to luck more than anything else\n\nSeriously, there are times when throw this guy around and have the headband pretzel in a concerning fashion, only to pick them up again, put them back on, and continue where I left off none the worse for wear. Every time I'd get a little alarmed at the aggressive way that I'd just manhandled my headset, it'd be a completely irrational fear. Barring smashing these things with a hammer or actually trying to bend the headband 180 degrees in the opposite direction, there's no conceivable way to me you could break these in day to day use. I've included a few pictures of the wear and tear they've accumulated over the years, as well as the lengths to which they regularly bend just to give you an idea of the punishment they can take. Believe me when I say the build quality is second to none.\n\nNow, at this point you know the headset itself is durable, but you might still be wondering about the cable used to connect said headset to your preferred device. Wonder no more. The included cable is 48 inches of (what might as well be) braided steel, and in my two years of usage, it's accumulated nary a scratch save for a small, nearly nonexistent kink below the volume control. It's detachable too, so you never have to worry about the annoyance and potential stress point that comes from having a cable permanently anchored to your headset. I've coiled this thing up all sorts of ways, tossed it into my pockets and backpack in a ball, and it's none the worse for wear considering. Even if you DO somehow manage to break the cable or render it otherwise unusable, don't worry; it can be replaced with any other 3.5mm audio cable with zero hit to sound quality. Trust me. I've checked.\n\nMy only real gripe about this product is that my microphone has never worked; even brand new out of the box. I've since bought a replacement mic that also hasn't worked either, so my guess is that it's a manufacturing defect rather than something that broke during use over the years. This is really only something that you should think about if you don't already have a mic and/or will be using this mainly for games. Even if yours also turns out to be broken, I'm sure the folks in customer support would be more than willing to exchange your defective set for a functioning unit.\n\nBut yeah. This has got to be the best headset I've ever purchased in the ten odd years I've been using them. The price is a bit steep compared your standard headset fare, but the price of admission is well worth it. I've used these things so much that the pleather on the earcups is starting to peel off, and I'll continue to use them until I literally can't anymore, for whatever reason that may be. Can't recommend them enough.",
                "3": "These headphones just work. They are built well, and sound great. If you want a safe and reliable choice these and the cloud 2 are the best. For gaming these are awesome, they are comfy and glasses friendly, however the mic does provide some echoing sometimes, so not perfect. They aren't too heavy, but you know when they're on your head. The detachable cable is well made, and most importantly replicable, unlike the cloud 2s. The sound quality for an average use case is just fantastic, especially if the hardware you attach it to has some sort of audio software like Dolby Atmos (they are much better than the cloud 2s for sound quality).\nAnd honestly the most important thing with these is that unless you're just really unlucky these will last. I had cloud 2s for a year and half, then the cable started to break, these though are going on over 2 years strong and the cable is worn, but usable, and replicable. They are built really well, I used them for most of those 2 years as daily drivers, and they suffered through being crammed into a school bag, going to the gym, going on light runs and walks. They have been dropped, used while raining, and snowing (with a hoodie on) and they still just work, and work as well as they did when I got them. Through rain or shine, they just work.\nImportant thing to mention is that they do not have active noise cancellation, however if you are in calm normal environments like a home, café, car ride, they do the trick. Even on a plane ride they did okay, they just aren't on the same level as dedicated anc Bose, or Sony headphones. The benefit is though they sound as good or better for less.\nIf you want gaming headphones, or just headphones and are anxious about the price, don't worry they are worth it 100%, I'd say if you are looking in the 50ish price range its worth jumping up and getting these, they won't let you down, and they will last. These and the hyper x cloud 2s are some of the only products in general that feel like they are made to last. And even the packaging makes you think \"okay they cared about this\" and that is just the best feeling you can get out of something. If phones still had headphone jacks readily available then I would recommend these for most people, just for daily general use. Could not recommend more.",
                "4": "I bought the Cloud Alpha S model with 7.1 to replace my broken V-Moda Crossfade M-100's, which I'd been using for a bit over two years. Good god, these things are such an improvement in terms of comfort. Whereas my old set would constantly apply pressure to my ears, this set can be worn for hours on end without discomfort. That being said, it's not as though you can't feel them. It's just not unpleasant. The band rests comfortably on the top of of your head, without applying an uncomfortable amount of pressure as well. For once, I was actually able to use a set that wouldn't screw up the top of my hair lol. As for sound, the quality is pretty solid, though I would recommend using a 3.5 mm aux cord directly into your pc's 3.5 mm port if you're just talking with friends over something like discord, as this seemed a bit lower and muffled for me when using the usb adapter. The issue with that is that the included 3.5 mm cable is extremely short, since it was intended to be used with the long adapter cable. Using the 7.1 is something I would reserve only for certain games that require great audio cues (things like Rainbow Six Siege, Counter Strike, etc). I say this because the 7.1 setting provides outstanding audio cues to location for these types of games, but it comes at the profound cost of audio quality in my opinion. The setup comes with an audio adapter that you plug a 3.5 mm cable into, and the adapter itself plugs into a usb port on your pc or console. Without this adapter, you lose the ability to use 7.1, and the audio to me at least, sounds a bit more muffled. However, the adapter is easy to use, allowing you to control volume and enable/disable the 7.1 functionality at the press of a button. Bass is pretty solid overall, but there isn't much you can do to adjust it out of the box. You have three settings controlled by a switch on each phone. Noise cancellation is pretty solid. They aren't going to make you deaf to things around you, but they will make dealing with screaming children in the house bearable. The mic quality isn't much to brag about, but if you're only using it for chatting with people, it's more than sufficient. I'd recommend an external, standalone microphone if you're looking to do any recording or something along those lines.\nOverall, and for the price, this is a pretty solid headset, and I'd recommend it.",
                "5": "Short of plugging these into a HyperX Quadcast mic, I doubt you'll find a much better setup for gaming....especially at this price point. The sound quality is amazing for headphones in any context and the earcups are very very comfy. The built-in mic sounds very good for a headset mic, but I digress...\n\nI started off with the Cloud I's first and absolutely loved them, but the volume pot started getting scratchy and I worried about damage to the attached cable becoming an issue. So I figured I'd stick with HyperX and give these Cloud Alpha's a try, since the cable does detach. I love the Cloud I's, so I'll just stick to comparing the two of those as they are both phenomenal headsets and would both be a good buy.\n\n-Build and Comfort-\nHyperX is just KILLING it on the comfort front IMO. The earcups are basically like tempurpedic memory foam and are a joy to wear. Where the Alpha differs from the Cloud I's is how they feel out of the box. The Alphas still super comfy, but firmer than the Cloud I's. After some wear-in, they soften up, but I can imagine the Alphas lasting longer because of this. Still comfy, just not quite as squishy. Some people may prefer a firmer feel, YMMV.\n\nBoth headphones feel very solid and have a good weight to them. Could use some more padding in the headband, but I don't really feel much discomfort after wearing them. This is about the only comfort area I could see them needing improvement on. Not sure if it really amounts to build quality, but the previously mentioned attached cable on the Cloud I's has become an issue for me (the volume pot is really scratchy), but the Alphas have a removable cord and the volume pot feels much more sturdy as well.\n\n-Sound Quality-\nHoly crap, I have literally returned $500 Shure headphones in favor of these. And to all assuming I have unrefined, plebian ears...16 years as a guitarist/bassist, audio engineering work for 6 of those years, running PA boards at a few venues, and a gig as a backing bassist for a solo artist (using in-ears) would put me a cut above the typical dude listening to Spotify on his iPhone. I know a good pair when I hear it.\n\nNow the Shures were not flat response for mixing or monitoring, they were listening headphones, but while there is a slight EQ curve and some \"signature\" enhancements on the Alphas, they are surprisingly flat in a good way...albeit with some extended bass and very smooth highs. The difference is the Cloud I's seemed to have more bass due to an EQ bump in the low-end response along with the seal being tighter on your ears with their squishier earcups. The Alphas are firmer and so the seal isn't quite as tight on my head, making for less perceived bass at first, but if you squish them on your ears you catch a bit more of the low-end.\n\nI will also say the low-end on the Alphas is much cleaner than on the Cloud I's, which may not be caught by some listeners. When you hear explosions, rumbling, or are listening to bassy music you won't hear these buzzing or bottoming out like the Cloud I's can. I use an external Sound Blaster card with one of my PCs and my custom EQ curve for music listening is handled beautifully by these Alphas. This by no means is an insult to the Cloud I's, they are easily contenders with most $100-$250 listening headsets out there, but in comparison to the Alphas, these are the differences you'll experience.\n\n-Noise Isolation-\nThe Alphas are, again, not as tight a seal as the Cloud I's but that could change in time. FWIW, these cut out a noticeable amount of noise...with only really rumbly or booming sounds getting through. A neighbor firing up a giant truck or thunder outside will catch my attention, but high pitched sounds get drowned out when you are listening to music or playing a game. I'm sure with wear they'll get even better, but for a passive headset they do a fine job.\n\n-Mic Quality-\nThe mic is perfectly fine and right in line with most $100+ gaming headset mics. Don't expect something on-par with a dedicated mic like the HyperX Quadcast or a Razer Siren, this is a totally different league of mic, but does a respectable job. Most people use these for Discord or Zoom calls, or want to cut down on background noise as opposed to using an external mic.\n\n-Connectors-\nThe core cable has the headphone/mic conductors built into one 3.5mm plug, the same as old iPhone headsets and many other gaming headsets do. There is an extender cable that splits it out to a headphone and mic plug separately. One thing I found weird, is my Cloud I's were the same, but when I plugged the single 3.5mm combo jack into my HyperX Quadcast they flat out would not work. HOWEVER, the Alphas DO work for some reason. Not sure why, seems like basically the same cable. Either way, the cable is long enough for most folks' rigs so no worries on that.\n\n-Overall-\nIf you want a gaming headset, or even just a headset for listening to music at your computer comfortably, this is an amazing headset. If you're fine with over-ear headphones for listening on the go, there's no reason not to use these IMO. If you're a streamer and want to save money and still get great performance...BUY THESE!!\n\nSome people might scoff at these and not consider them good since they aren't \"Pro Level\" gear, but honestly for monitoring and even music listening I would put these up against nearly any sub-$600 headset. I don't abuse the hell out of my headphones, but they definitely get put to use for hours on end every day and I've still had no issues. The Cloud I's (non-USB) are great too, but for a bit more the Alphas are just plain amazing. The only thing you need to worry about these is if they discontinue them!",
                "6": "Foreground: I will be doing a comparison to a previous headset and explaining my current setup, then we'll get into the review.\n\nMy previous headset was the Turtle Beach Elite Pro with T.A.C. the headset itself lasted me about 2.5 years and within the last year sounds slowly started becoming muffled, and the L ear driver seemed to be shorting out. (Sounded like I was going deaf in my L ear). I was in the market looking for a headset that could serve my needs as an extensive gamer and a streamer. The turtle beaches served me well for the first year but I wanted to see what else was available.\n\nQue in the HyperX Cloud Alpha. I was in debate between these, the Cloud Revolver S, and Sennheiser PC37x from Massdrop. I decided to pull the trigger on the Alphas because after reading TONS of reviews, it appeared that they seemed to be the best \"bang\" for your buck as well as one of the best sounding headsets out there. I wasn't too worried about price though as I had spent $200 on the TB's I had prior. I just wanted a headset that fit my needs which was:\n\n1: Comfort; as I sometimes have 8+ hour long streaming/gaming sessions\n2: Sound Quality; I play tons of competitive shooters as well as indie games and listen to music. I wanted crisp audio with decent bass and mids\n3: Durability; When spending over $100 I'd like to hang on to gear for AT LEAST 2+ years\n\nWith all that said, I won't overstate too much which can be found from other reviews on here.\n\nIF YOU PLAY SHOOTERS, YOU NEED THIS HEADSET.\nI cannot stress this enough. I couldn't believe how many specific audio cues I was missing out on while wearing my turtle beaches. Now, to be fair, I do have my Alpha's connected into the turtle beach TAC(tactical audio controller) essentially and external USB mixamp. And it gives me mic monitoring and a bit of audio boost. But, the fact that these SOAR over turtle beach's premium flagship headset in audio quality really does say something.\n\nThe only small gripes I have is that my ears touch the drivers and the outbound mic quality sound is just a LITTLE bit more artificial and nasly than it was on the Elite Pro's. It doesn't cause any ear fatigue but I just ended up getting used to it. I suppose I can just fix that with some thicker earpads.\n\nTo summarize:\nHyperX Cloud Alpha's are just amazing and blow other competition out of the water. In audio quality, this is what I expect out of spending $100 and I think this should now be the Gold Standard for gaming headsets. Super comfy, fantastic audio quality, good microphone, and great build. 5/5",
                "7": "I've used the HyperX Cloud 2 and decided to get these after those died. Absolutely love the Cloud Alpha S. Super comfy and the bass is way better than the Cloud 2. Also music quality is about as good or better.\n\nMy main worry is HP. They bought the HyperX brand from Kingston in 2021. We finally saw one of their new headsets specifically under the control of HP which were the HyperX Cloud III headsets. These headsets not only have worse microphones but the sound quality and build quality are huge downgrades from the Cloud 2's and even sometimes more expensive than what the Cloud 2 was. It's obvious now that HP is destroying what was one of the best gaming brands on the market.\n\nI have the HyperX Quadcast and HyperX Alloy keyboard and love those things but it's obvious now that these products are on borrowed down after the HP buyout. Get their products before the refreshes come out for everything else and it's impossible to find any of their actual good stuff anymore.",
                "8": "Got this for my brother and he hasent had a complaint about it. He wares it for up to 6 hours when his playing and said they are not uncomfortable. The microphone works well, even has a mute button when his speaking to someone in the house and doesn't want his friends to hear him. The sound is clear too from both ends.",
                "9": "these are honestly good headphones, but i didn't know they would cause pain on one side (ear) every time i wear them. i think it might be because i wear glasses OR the clamping pressure. it gets uncomfortable after like 20 mins of wearing them. i will flip them, but then the opposite side starts hurting, but i need to wear glasses :(",
                "10": "I had this headset previously back in 2017, and it took them quite some time before they fell apart from consistent use with the cord from wear and tear, being kicked around, stepped on, and pulled on over the years. This tells you the high quality of the brand where many others get destroyed so much quickly.\n\nGetting the new headset in a different color told me specifically that the quality has still stayed top-notch! They're still comfortable, to the point at times I often forget it's on my head during long gaming sessions. The mic quality is great to talk on in voice chats, and so are the extra ear cushions too.\n\nI didn't immediately review this because I wanted to see if they were the same level of quality as the ones I bought previously, and sure enough, they are! I can only hope the quality of this brand of headset stays high when I inevitably buy these in another six years."

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "Quick background, skip if uninterested: I’m absolutely not an audiophile so this review doesn’t come from a place of incredible pickiness. My old (and cheap) headset broke in the middle of playing online with friends. I was very upset and rushed to Best Buy that evening in an attempt to quickly replace it. Needless to say I was tempted into buying something else(a different “gamer headset” brand) and hated it a lot. After fighting with that horrible setup for a few hours, I decided to order the Arctis 7+ here.\n\nStart of review for the particular 7+ model I bought off here:\nDELIVERY- I ordered it and it arrived wayyy earlier than I expected. I was so excited to try it out. So far I’ve used them them for about 2-3 months.\nCOMFORTABLE- I can say they’re very very comfortable. Even after some 10 hour play sessions, I almost forget they’re there and bump them. The pads around the ears are a perfectly soft material. They’re a soft fabric material that does not break down like I’ve noticed the smooth fake leather to. These also don’t get too hot around my ears thanks to the breathable padding material.\nI have long hair and OTHER headphones tend to grab and pull out my hair a lot- I haven’t had that issue with this set except a couple times where the fault was all on me because I pulled a joint area through my hair. Otherwise, it seems it’s really hard for this to happen on accident like my other sets always did (Owwy!)\nUnlike most other headphones, this set has an elastic- yet soft- band under the headband that pretty much suspends the headphones over your head rather than resting their weight directly on the top of your scalp. I find that this design choice really improves the comfort for me, as with other headphone sets the weight and rigidity of the headband start to hurt over time. The Bluetooth feature on this also allows me to sit back, play from a couch, or go get a drink (important!) while still talking to my friends.\n\nSOUND QUALITY- I once again want to remind that I am no audiophile. After getting these and starting some gameplay, I immediately noticed highs and lows I wasn’t hearing from my old headsets. Little environmental sounds, instruments in soundtracks I never noticed or heard before, subtle feedback sounds from button presses and menus, I recall calling them out to my friends and them being equally surprised I now noticed them.\nOne of my personal gripes with modern headphones lately is that every company wants to make super bassy sounding headphones, as the average person associates quality with bass for some reason. Out of the box, all of the sound levels for these are perfect in my opinion, not too bassy or anything. If you wanted bassy headphones out of this though, you could easily just go in and change that using the steel series sound control app. I haven’t changed anything myself because I like how they sound as is.\nAnother thing I wanted was independent volume control for the headphones, which this has! Not only can you control the volume with a dial on the headset but you can also adjust wether you want chat or game sounds to be louder than the other on the headset. I was also concerned that audio quality may differ between wired or wireless connection, but everything seems fine regardless of connection type. Mic quality is decent for hanging out and talking to friends. We never have static issues, it never catches annoying background noise, no chirps, so far I’ve heard no issue myself. The mic quality probably isn’t something you’d use for high quality production, like making videos, podcasts, or streaming. Though you probably could do any of those things if you’re not a stickler for recording quality. I feel it’s mainly a headset for comfortably gaming- a role it’s more than fulfilled for me!\n\nNOISE CANCELLATION- I’m personally indifferent to wether my headsets have noise cancellation or not. I don’t live in a particularly loud place, so I don’t get to test this one out much. Every once in a while another family member may approach me to ask something, and I can hear them at that point, but not if they call from another room. The outer side of the mic has a small mic that picks up sound outside your headset and feeds it back to you with a subtle and quiet delay. I’m not used to that myself but it does come in handy here and there. It does sometimes also trick me into thinking the headset mic is picking up and putting outside noise into my calls (it’s not though, confirmed by friends). I’m indifferent to this feature, as it hasn’t caused me too much issue and I’m pretty sure it can be turned off.\n\nOTHER FEATURES- The mic is posable and retracts, it’s a pretty nice way to store the headset or just get the mic out of your peripheral vision until in use.\nThere’s a small button on the left side that mutes the mic, when muted the mic lights red, which is a pretty handy visual reminder as in the past I have often found myself talking for minutes on end to myself while in calls with friends (lol).\nThe headset comes with some other wired connection options, even a headphone Jack option.\nTo connect to your computer it DOES use a wired dongle, so if you are trying to save on USB port space, be aware it does take one.\nI’m not sure how to measure this, the Bluetooth connectivity works throughout my whole room and even in the rooms immediately over. I am usually able to go to my kitchen and prepare myself food or drinks while still enjoying music or talking, so long as the battery has a decent charge.\nThe battery life is REALLY good. I personally have always made it a habit to charge anything when I’m not using it, so I never see it die. BUT to vouch for its lifetime- one time I didn’t realize the USB end of my cord wasn’t plugged into my computer until after a week of thinking I had been charging it nightly after game sessions and daily use. This thing lasted a whole week of /at least/ 6-8 hour use daily with absolutely no charging that whole time before I just happened to pull on the usb for it and find it had never been plugged back in that whole week. So for sure with this headset, unless you’re playing insanely all the time with the highest volume in use, you’ll never see it die so long as you check it in for a charge here and there!\n\nEnd summary: Overall I can say I’m very happy with this headset. Definitely has become my favorite one. I would strongly recommend it to anyone that wants a headset suited best for comfortable gaming and chatting. I was skeptical of Bluetooth functionality before buying, but it has WELL PAST won me over.",
                "2": "This is perhaps the only headset I've had where my hair doesn't constantly get stuck. The cuffs are nice and soft, and the light weight of the headset lead to my usually 2-3 hour stream to be nearly 6 hours without noticing the time. Could have probably gone longer too. The battery life lasts me a good few days w/o needing to be charged every day. The quality of the sound is nice too with the only downside being no noise canceling, but I like to be able to hear my environment in case of emergencies and knowing what will and will not be picked up by my mic. It does take a bit to get the split audio sorted, so patience is a must especially if you are not familiar with it. I found it easy enough if you are familiar with headset software.",
                "3": "The headset fits really nice, it's light and VERY comfortable, you barely feel it after a long while of using them. Sound quality is really good, for music and gaming is amazing. I've tried it with Gears 5 and DMC 5 and it's simply amazing. Easy to use after you quickly check the manual, can use the transmitter with the PC and the Bluetooth with the phone simultaneously, and that's cool.\nThe bad: The software. Download ONLY the Engine application, NEVER ACTIVATE THE SONAR APP, it's supposed to be for spatial sound, but not only doesn't sound that good, it'll override your sound system and make a mess to use your PC without the headphones, could only fix after uninstalling, so beware.\nBTW: The heatset sounds amazing with Dolby Atmos and cool with DTS (but the voices can get kinda muddy with DTS).",
                "4": "I really like how it can connect to Bluetooth and through the wireless dongle concurrently. I've had Bluetooth earbuds that advertise multipoint connections, but those ones just swap between devices when it detects audio rather than allow you to hear both simultaneously.\n\nI dislike how tight these feel around my head. My previous headphones were very comfortable; I could wear them all day. These ones make my head feel constricted and my ears hot. You can adjust the height of the headphones but not how tight it wraps around your head as far as I can tell. Another negative is that it slips around my head when I tilt it forward or backwards.\n\nThe microphone is decent out of the box; crystal clear but a tad on the soft side and not very authentic sounding. The audio is also plenty good out of the box. I'd say the sonar software isn't required to be pleased with the product. I personally haven't downloaded it, but I'm sure it would allow for a greater set of customization and improve the sound and microphone experience.\n\nThere is also some side tone when your mic is on, whether you are in a call or not, that amplifies the sound of your surroundings. You can mute your mic to stop this.\n\nMy final observation I will mention is in regards to the battery indicator. It's not very specific. The indicator stays green between the wide range of 50% to 100%. Even while charging you can't really tell if it's close to being fully charged. I can confirm though that the charging indicator will turn off by itself when the battery is at 100%.\n\nUpdate: After spending more time using these headphones, I have a few new observations to add to my review.\n\nI noticed sound leaks through the foam earcup cushions. If there's anyone around you and the sound is at or above a medium volume, it can be heard. Likewise, the microphone can pick up sound from the drivers above a certain threshold.\n\nThe headphones have been stretched to fit my head better. I can wear it for longer periods of time now without feeling like my head is going to explode, though I stick to my original sentiment of it not being the most comfortable.\n\nFinally, I will also mention the audio has gotten glitchy on me a couple of times. The first time this happened I just did a quick reset to fix it. The second time I just waited, and after roughly 5 - 10 seconds it fixed itself. I'm assuming the connection momentarily became weak. I'm not sure why as I was sitting right next to the dongle both times.",
                "5": "I finally know how to use my headset. It took some trial and error, mostly because I've never used a wireless headset with some of these features, and never this brand. I hope the information helps you.\n\nNow that I've gotten everything figured out, I am having a great experience with this headset. Here are the things I've learned:\n\nLeft earcup: The rearmost button mutes the mic. If you have the boom extended, the mic will have a glowing red (and annoying) stripe. There is probably a way to turn that off, but as far as I can tell, the mic works perfectly well fully retracted. So when that button is raised, the mic is muted. When it's pressed in, it's live. I like that tactile system better.\n\nVolume knob: Slide it to the rear to increase, to the front to decrease. I recommend staring in the lower 1/2 of the dial the first time you use these.\n\nPorts and stuff: I'll let the manual handle these. Reminder, you can use the headset wired using the USB cable that comes with the headset (or I guess any USB cable that has USB-C on at least 1 end).\n\nRight earcup: This is where I had trouble figuring things out. The knob is the chatmix knob, which should let you adjust the strength of your media volume against the strength of the volume in whatever chat app you're using. To the rear for media, to the front for chat. I had the wheel halfway between the halfway mark and the front, and all the volume for the media I was streaming was super quiet. I thought maybe the headset had a volume limiter, but per support, it does not. Instead of trying all the 'pull off the foam and reset/ reinstall everything' that was already a fresh install, almost by accident I found out that if you have the knob halfway (has a nice little click or bump when you hit the middle), the volume is fine. I currently have mine halfway between the halfway mark and all the way back. If I need to adjust it, I know how now.\n\nSide Tone: This is a software feature. It lets you hear what your mic is picking up. HEAVEN FORBID you accidentally rub your arm or your sleeve over the mics while this feature is on. It nearly scared the life out of me until I figured out how to turn that off. It's in the software.\n\nThat's about it, I'm having fun playing with the EQ in Sonar to get the sound exactly as I like it, and the headset is as nice and loud as I'd like it to be. Definitely glad I made this purchase, upgrading to a wireless headset has been life-changing already.\n\nOH! And the range. I have a 1 br apartment, 1 bath, kitchen, living area, dining area. If you think of the living area as the front right quadrant, bedroom rear left, bathroom rear right and dining room front left: I was able to travel to every far corner of the apartment with no problem. I am not taking this outside while the dongle is on my PC, so it has all the range I need. People with large ranch or multi-level homes, your experience may vary, but it's certainly not as bad as some reviews made it sound.\n\nAlso the headband and ear cups are every bit as comfortable as nearly every says they are.\n\nEnjoy!",
                "6": "Kicking myself for not going wireless sooner!\n\nMy only real complaint would be the lack of noise cancelling, so hoping this could be added to the software in the future for headsets that do not have this feature in hardware.\n\nVery comfortable and adjustable. High build quality. I also enjoy the ability to also pair with a Bluetooth device (e.g. phone) and still listen to PC audio.\n\nCharging is quick and lasts for days of regular use.",
                "7": "Use wise they work great and sound great. Charge wise they seem to last forever between charges. My only complaint is they tend to run a bit small or tight but that might be because I have a bigger head (hat size 7-3/4). Volume could get a little louder but I'm old and don't hear so good. I don't really use all the bells and whistles but they have them if you're into that kind of thing. I use them for online gaming with my son and they are great for that. PS if the charge dies you can get 6-8 hours out of a 10 to 15 minute charge...",
                "8": "3.5 stars.\nPros:\n3rd most comfortable headphones I've worn.\nDecent range - I can go downstairs to the kitchen or down 2 flights to the front door without losing connection.\nEasy to setup\nRed light on the mike so I *know* whether or not I'm muted\nMike does good noise-cancelling (headphones don't do active NC)\nOK sound quality.\n\nDisappointments:\nI bought an Arctis 7 five years ago and used it daily since then, mostly for work video conferencing. However, I started having some problems with the mic cutting in and out and then one of the earpads fell off so I figured I'd finally replace it. I went looking for the same ski-goggle-strap style headband because it's the most comfortable of any headphones that my partner or I have tried. Sadly, no one else seems to have picked up the same style and SteelSeries is getting rid of it in favor of a less-adjustable option for their Nova.\n\nAfter trying a logitech option and being disappointed, I decided I'd just go with the same thing I bought last time rather than trying to find something new. I thought the 7+ would be basically the same, but it's not. The first one I got kept randomly shutting off. Whatever, some devices are duds and Amazon exchanged it easily for me. But this new one is still worse than the original 7. It's less comfortable, although that might be more about breaking it in. But the mute button only occasionally works. I have to stick my fingernail in it to get it to pop open. Sometimes it'll seem like it popped open, but the red light doesn't switch so I know I'm not muted.\n\nThen there's the software. I installed the software and updated the headphones firmware, and it was basically fine. I tried the new Sonar tools and adjusted the sounds so they sounded good. I really liked that I could adjust the mike to fit my higher-pitched voice. Very cool. Only, when I select the \"sonar\" options in my audio list, the headphones just don't work. No sound comes through at all. Fortunately, there's still a generic option for the \"arctis 7+\" and I've been using that instead. The headphones beep when they turn on/off. The old ones did too, but this beep is higher pitched and much more annoying.\n\nI'd probably return them if I were inside the return window because that's a lot of caveats for the money. But they're good in a lot of ways and I'm biased by the comparison with the earlier Arctis 7, which were the best headphones I've ever owned.",
                "9": "So I've had the Arctis 7 headset for years and it never really fit well (I put up with it because the sound quality was SO much better than other brands) so I was a bit skeptical about buying the Nova 7 headset.... All of that went away the second I put the Nova headset on. It's lightweight, fully adjustable, and the sound quality improved over the Arctis 7 line. I've already had profiles set up in GG so switching over to the Nova from the old Arctis was easy, I didn't even have to mess with any of my old profiles, the Nova just made everything sound so much better. I marked the noise canceling lower because it's not true noise canceling, if you have it at a lower volume, sound does bleed through. But the audio quality of the drivers is so good that unless you have a rave going off next to you, you won't hear a thing other than what's playing through the headset. I've been in music production and mixing for the past decade and the Nova is better than my studio headphones. As soon as I got them, I loaded up some of my favorite bass-heavy music and blasted it through the headset. Steelseries might as well advertise these as haptic because the bass gets them moving. My friends in Discord say the mic quality is good, which I also have filtered through GG. Overall, I couldn't be happier.\n\nIf you're considering getting this headset and don't mind running Steelseries GG to tweak your sound profiles, definitely get it.",
                "10": "I got into the habit of writing my reviews after a few weeks/months, as the joy of unpacking and trying the new product out for the first time is often so great that you subconsciously tend to ignore minor flaws. Once you have used what you have bought for several weeks, you can certainly give other buyers much more useful tips than at first. After about 4 months with the Arctis Nova 7 Wireless Headset I can say that it excels compared to the competition in the same price-range.\nThe set has a soft, elastic band under the headband which means that it suspends the headphones over your head rather than resting its weight directly on the top of your scalp which means that it's EXTREMELY comfortable and the set never started to hurt over time. Sound quality is excellent for this price range BUT it needs tweaking. Luckily, the SteelSeries GG Sonar app is easy to use and does an good job in this regard. Noise cancellation is OK-ish. Functional but a bit below the expected standard at times. The mic also needs some tweaking but it's perfectly fine once tuned.\nThe Bluetooth functionality is the absolute highlight of the set. Really effective, it never let me down. My only complaint is the build materials. The plastic (the set has no metal parts!) is fragile. For the price, I would have expected some sturdier materials. So buy a case or a stand for it, it's a must.\nOverall, I’m very happy with this headset. I would strongly recommend it to anyone that wants a headset for comfortable long sessions of gaming and chatting with flawless Bluetooth functionality."

                "1": "I have been a fan of SteelSeries headsets ever since I bought my Siberia V2's 7 years ago. The Siberia V2's still work flawlessly but the thin rubber coating on the foam ear pads started peeling away and leaving black specks stuck to my head and hair, so it was time to upgrade. I saw no reason to switch away from SteelSeries, and I'm glad I didn't as they continue to impress with quality headsets. I'm so far loving this headset, it's an improvement over the Siberia V2's in every way. And the few Cons I've been able to find are minor and not deal breakers.\n\nPRO's\nThe first thing I noticed about the Arctis 3's was the ear pads have a fabric coating, as apposed to the thin rubber coating of the Siberia V2's. This, to me a huge upgrade, as that coating peeling away was what prompted me to make this switch in the first place. It's good to know I will not be running into that problem this time around.\nAnother positive change over the V2's is that the Arctis 3's use a headphone jack as apposed to USB. I travel a lot and therefor game on a laptop, and that means limited USB ports. Not having to dedicate a USB port to my headset is a big positive improvement.\nSound quality is the same amazing standard that I've come to expect from Steelseries.\nRetractable mic means you can use the headset as actual headphones for your phone or music device when not gaming and not look like a tool.\n\nCONs\nThis is personal preference most likely, but I don't like the rubber coated cord. It makes it feel cheap and fragile to me. Would have preferred they went with a threaded cord.\nThe cord is kind of short. This isn't a problem for me, as I game on a laptop, but I could see this easily becoming a problem on a desktop depending on where your headphone jack is located.\nMic is quiet. Had to turn my settings all the way up in order for people to hear me talking, and even then most people on Discord had to turn my volume up on their end. And the Mic won't even pick up my voice unless it's fully extended and placed directly in front of my mouth.\nThe location of the volume control and mute button are on the back of the headset. This isn't so much of a problem but you just need to be conscious of the controls if you ever rest your head back.",
                "2": "(note: I wear glasses. I feel like this is important to mention with headsets >.>)\n\nHonestly, I never expected headphones to make such a big difference in experience. My first headset was a 25$-ish headset that broke, so I decided well, lets try something a bit better from a reputable brand, and ended up buying this one for 40$, and it is worth every. single. cent. spent.\n\nAudio is amazing, and it comes with an application you can download that allows you to tweak the sound depending on your use. It did seem a bit overwhelming at first, but its actually fairly simple to use once you get to understand it a bit.\n\nThe headset does feel a little tight on the head, but so far its not uncomfortable to use for long periods of time, as long as you put it on right. Even while using glasses, this feels ok on the head. If you put it on wrong however, like I did when I first got it, it would be very uncomfortable and even painful.\n\nMy only complaints would be that, because its all plastic and feels a bit hard, I get worried about breaking it and try to use it as gently as I can. However, I have seen a Youtuber do a review of this headset and he stretches it beyond what my heart can handle without breaking, so there's that little bit of relief found there xD. The 2nd complaint is the short wire length. Would have loved having it be a bit longer, but its not bad.\n\nOverall, my experience with it has been pretty well. So well that, despite the 2 complaints I listed above, I'd still be willing to give this a 5/5.",
                "3": "This headset has definitely helped me up my game! I noticed an immediate difference in spatial awareness and now I can actually hear where other players are coming from. The sleek and ergonomic design of the Nova 1 immediately caught my eye. The build quality is top-notch, with a perfect balance of durability and lightweight construction. The plush ear cushions and adjustable headband ensure hours of gaming without the slightest discomfort. I really like the stowaway microphone. The audio is well-balanced but if you are planning to listen to music I would bump up the bass a little more. Overall a nice quality headset!",
                "4": "Working very well with high quality sound. The mic doesn't sound good but it works so that's a win for sure.",
                "5": "I have NEVER liked headphones because they have always hurt my head and ears. Always. This is why I have never been able to purchase super high-quality headphones and enjoy my music at its fullest potential. But I gotta say, for the price point, I am VERY satisfied with these. ESPECIALLY THE COMFORT. I was told to purchase these for their comfort mainly, and I am so glad I did. And the quality of the sound, again, is great for its price point. Don't expect anything life-changing of course, but I have for sure heard worst for more if that makes sense. Sound cancellation isn't the best either, but with a DAC I am able to crank my computer's volume very high so it doesn't bother me too much. If you're someone who values being able to still hear your surroundings while you're enjoying your music or gaming, these will also be good for that reason. Overall, very good for its price. I highly recommend these.",
                "6": "This headset fitted all the requirements I needed for my travel gaming setup. The microphone quality is fantastic for the price, and can easily beat other microphones in the same price range. The plastic is cheap though, and you will need to be careful with handling it if you want the headset to last. The cables are detachable so if they go bad you can replace them. The on board controls are okay, but good that there is a volume wheel and mute button. I do not like how steelseries has their mute button set up to be unmuted when pressed but whatever. The earcups swivel for comfort and easy packing. The earpads and band are comfortable. So overall they are a great headset for entry level or travel. Just be careful since the build quality is on the lower end, which is why they feel light.",
                "7": "I bought this headset after many years of using a budget headset. I'm a PC gamer and will sometimes game for hours at a time.\n\nTLDR; This headset is SUPER comfortable and stays that way for hours of gaming. The sound quality is great and I love the mic button/volume adjustment on the ear piece. Would definitely recommend.\n\n- Comfort: I've have to say this is the number one factor I had in purchasing this headset. I went to an electronics store and tried on several before purchasing on Amazon. The cushions feel soft and plushy and the headphones can fit over my ears very comfortably (even with my piercings in the top and bottom of my ears on). The ear pieces swivel to allow good placement in respect to my face and the adjustable, elastic headband makes it sit well on my head. I felt that all other headsets I tried, no matter how much padding they had on top, felt awkward or heavy on my head (which I admit, I do have a really large head). On the other hand, these feel amazingly comfortable, and stay that way whether I game for an hour or 5. The padding also seems to breathe well and doesn't make me feel all sweaty if I game for a while.\n- Sound Quality: Let me say that I'm not one to typically purchase expensive headsets so I can't compare it to other ones. But, did I hear a difference switching to this headset from my old one? Absolutely. I could hear sound effects in my games much more clearly, and it was more defined. It also blocked out other background noises very well.\n- Mic: Works well and picks up my voice clearly (even when I forget to pull out the mic). I was told the sound from my mic did improve noticeably after switching headsets. I like that this mic is retractable rather than just folding up, and that this makes it adjustable after pulling it out.\n- Buttons on earpiece: There is a button to turn the mic on/off as well as a volume adjustment dial on the left earphone. My last headset had these adjustments on the headset cord, and I like them being on my ear piece much better. It made them easier to reach for rather than tangling with my cord whenever I want to mute my mic.\n- Cord: No complaints here. Since I'm always gaming at my desk, I felt no need to go with the wireless versions of this headset. The cord is long and flexible and seems to be very durable is well.",
                "8": "As you read this review please note the headset was in excellent condition at the time it broke with no user related damage. Also, my experience during this entire communication process with Steel Series is that they will respond to your email once per day and not on the weekends.\n\nI bought this product in June 2021 and it broke early Oct 2021, one ear of the headset and mic no longer work.\nI purchased an extended warranty and called to make a claim, I was told it was still covered under the manufacturer one year warranty and I would need to go thru them.\nContacted product support on the Amazon site and advised I wanted to pursue a warranty claim. Spent 30 minutes in an online chat with someone trying to fix the device to no avail. Was told I would need to go directly thru the Steel Series website.\nSpent half an hour online with Steel Series going thru the same process of attempts to fix the device, still doesn't work.\nI was advised I would need to submit pictures of each earpiece, mic, headset, serial# and original receipt to make a warranty claim.\nI sent screenshots of everything but the Steel Series rep indicated they were unable to view the screenshots so I had to resend it in a PDF document.\nOnce that was done I was given a link to submit a warranty claim. You're required to break the headset apart in very specific ways or per Steel Series directions you risk voiding the warranty claim. (or you can send the headset back to Steel Series at your own expense and maybe/maybe not you'll get reimbursed that cost)\nI think I'm pretty strong but it's not easy to break them the way they ask, I had someone else try too. I advised Steel Series I was having trouble breaking them. I finally managed to break it but it snapped in a different area than the very specific way they advise you to or risk voiding the warranty.\nThen I had to send pictures of each broken piece. This time you can't use a PDF because it's too big for the space you need to upload it to, one space for each picture. Back to the screenshots which apparently now work for this part of the process.\nThen I got a an email saying I needed to send them a video of the product. Steel Series advised that they don't have enough data space for me to download a video and can't view a google link so I need to create a You Tube account or Vimeo account in order to send them the video.\nI responded asking where in the directions it indicated I need to send a video and what was wrong with the pictures I sent. I also indicated that I thought their process seemed designed to discourage warranty claims.\nI received a response saying -\n\"The video is needed because our system is requesting it for further verification. If you are unable to provide it to us please let me us know so I can close this ticket accordingly.\"\n\nSo, I guess I should just take a video without knowing what was wrong with the pictures and cross my fingers that Steel series now finds my submission acceptable???\nI asked for a Supervisor to call me. No response. I sent another request for a Supervisor to contact me. I received a response to that email that my request had been escalated. Then I received the following.\n\nThanks for reaching out to us. I read up on issue in the thread. I am one of the leads in the department. Video verification of destruction is something that our process requires. This part is important, and we really want to get you verified and get you your code for the new headset so that you will be able to get back to gaming, that we all love to do :). Please be sure to complete the video verification step, as not completing this will lead to denial of the warranty claim.\n\nStill no feedback on what was wrong with the pictures to ensure I accurately capture the information they want in the video. Still no call from a Supervisor. No ability to submit a video unless you're interested in creating a YouTube account for yourself and I assume uploading your video to YouTube for anyone to see??? I don't know if that's right because I don't have a YouTube account or have any interest in creating one. I sent a response again asking to speak with a Supervisor. I received a response from the same party that Steel Series only communicates through email. (As I noted at the top - they only communicate once a day, this has been going on for almost two weeks).\n\nI called and spoke with customer service at the extended warranty provider that I purchased from and explained what was going on. The party I spoke with agreed with my opinion that Steel Series appears to make it much more challenging than would be reasonably required to make a warranty claim and they were kind enough to honor the warranty at 100%. They gave me a prepaid label to send back the headset. When I told them I had destroyed the headset at the direction of Steel Series it got a little problematic but we were able to work it out and I have since been refunded the full cost of the headset by the extended warranty provider. The entire phone call with the extended warranty company took a half hour. They indicated they would be giving Amazon feedback on Steel Series warranty claim process, I hope they do.\n\nStill waiting to hear back from a Supervisor at Steel Series...........",
                "9": "Forgot I ordered them and surprisingly when I opened the box it was a bit mangled as if refurbished. Checked around the headset to see if there was any damage so far nothing so I won’t complain there.\n\nFeel: moving on from the other set of steels these feel a lot better. Ear and head feels well planted\n\nSound quality (music): sounds are really pronounced and bass feels good, I would wear these outside since they don’t give off gamer headset vibes\n\nPrice: can’t complain they’re suspiciously cheap but sound really good.\n\nMic/gaming: haven’t tried yet broke my glasses so kind of withholding from gaming at the moment.\n\nOriginally wanted to do 3 stars but the quality exceeded my expectations.",
                "10": "I did not travel with this headset or do anything weird. I bought it in July, attached it to my computer, and it lived there for the past several months, only moving between my head and my headset hook. It has not been thrown, dropped, or used roughly. I take it off the hook, put it on, wear it a while, take it off, put it back on the hook.\n\nToday (about 4 months later) I took it off the hook and the right earcup is hanging from the headband by the inner cord. It looks like a piece of plastic that held it together has snapped. The broken spot is nowhere near where the headset comes in contact with the hook.\n\nSeems like trying to get any sort of product warranty or whatnot from SteelSeries isn't worth the time or effort, but I'm certainly going to avoid their products in the future."

                "3": "Alright. So far, I am loving the controller. Now that it's working properly, anyway. One slight complaint with packaging, one real complaint that has to do with the controller itself, while other issues I had lay with the programs I was gaming with.\n\nPreface: I bought this controller to replace my old xbox 360 controller for PC gaming.\n\nPackaging: The box looked as if it were opened. A bit weird, but okay.\n\nProblems: Initially, the controller kept turning on and off, wouldn't connect properly and constantly shown to have low batteries (\"critical\" according to the Xbox game bar app...) despite having brand new ones put in. This is still an issue, but the battery is actually fine so I blame the Xbox game bar application for not sensing it right.\nOn top of this issue, the button inputs for \"A\" and \"B\" were confused for keyboard inputs during in-game sessions (on Steam).\n\nTroubleshooting: I tested the controller via Xbox accessories app to make sure the inputs were working fine, and they were.\n\nGoing to video guides and various forums I found out the battery problem was possibly caused by the clip bits that have the \"+\" and \"-\" signs on them being a bit too compressed, and gently pulling them out (to make sure they were holding the batteries securely and properly connected).\n\nAs for the keyboard-gamepad input confusion, I went into Steam's settings and had to select the \"Expanded Xbox Configuration support\" and \"Xbox Extended Feature Support\" and subsequently had to restart my PC. After that, controller worked like a charm, and I am loving it.\n\nIt was a bit taxing to do so much troubleshooting, I took the whole thing apart three times to check the motherboard against google images to make sure it was okay (haha). But in the end most of the issues had nothing to do with the controller, but just how it was being perceived by other programs. Just goes to show the issues may not be with the product but the stuff it interacts with.",
                "4": "As an avid Xbox gamer, I recently purchased the Xbox Core Wireless Controller in Robot White, and it has quickly become my go-to gamepad for all my gaming sessions. This controller truly exemplifies Microsoft's commitment to providing gamers with the best possible experience, combining comfort, precision, and versatility in one sleek package.\n\nThe standout feature of this controller is its refined design and comfortable grip. The smooth, matte finish combined with the ergonomic shape makes it incredibly comfortable to hold, even during long gaming sessions. The textured grips on the back ensure a secure and slip-free hold, allowing for precise control and smooth gameplay.\n\nThe responsive buttons and precise thumbsticks are simply fantastic. Whether I'm playing first-person shooters, racing games, or exploring vast open-world adventures, the controller's accurate inputs make me feel in complete control of my gaming experience. The responsive triggers offer an excellent level of feedback, further immersing me in the game's action.\n\nI appreciate the controller's wireless connectivity, which allows me to play from a comfortable distance without any annoying cables. Connecting it to my Xbox Series X was a breeze, and the strong wireless range ensures a stable connection without any noticeable input lag. Additionally, being able to use the same controller on my Windows 10 PC and Android devices is a huge plus for gaming on the go.\n\nThe built-in rechargeable battery is a convenient feature, as I no longer have to worry about constantly changing batteries. The battery life is impressive, lasting for several gaming sessions before needing a recharge via the included USB-C cable. It's also great to have a 3.5mm stereo headset jack, as it allows me to use my gaming headset seamlessly.\n\nAnother significant advantage of the Xbox Core Wireless Controller is its customizability. The Xbox Accessories app provides a wide range of options to remap buttons, adjust thumbstick sensitivity, and tweak trigger settings. This level of customization allows me to tailor the controller to my specific playstyle, giving me a competitive edge in games.\n\nThe Robot White color of the controller looks sleek and modern, complementing the aesthetics of my gaming setup. The overall build quality feels solid and durable, assuring me that this controller will withstand countless hours of gaming without any wear and tear.\n\nIn conclusion, the Xbox Core Wireless Controller in Robot White is a must-have accessory for Xbox gaming enthusiasts. Its comfort, precise controls, wireless connectivity, and customization options elevate the gaming experience to new heights. Whether you're a casual gamer or a dedicated player, this controller is an excellent investment that guarantees an immersive and enjoyable gaming journey. I highly recommend the Xbox Core Wireless Controller to anyone seeking a top-notch gamepad for their Xbox gaming sessions.",
                "5": "This is a controller and TOO expensive. Prices need to come down. But it works good, but should last longer and be more durable for the price.",
                "6": "This controller is super comfortable. I have not once felt like my hands are getting cramped or that any given button on the controller is out of reach. This controller is the product of 21 years of innovations by Microsoft on the design. I would say it's comparable to the 360 controller, but the new grips material on the controller and the buttons feel way better. I am also a fan of the clicks feel of some of the buttons, especially the dpad. I didn't think I was going to be a fan of this dpad given the way it looked in pictures, but this is a really solid dpad. I still need to test it out with a 2D fighting game, but I don't foresee there being any issues from the other games I have used it with so far",
                "7": "2020 has been a year chock full o’ disappointment, chaos & being tethered to the home which means more time planted on the sofa, like a bump on a log, grinding out time by playing video games & having the controllers get wonky in record time. I wasn’t looking to buy the newer model controllers & simply wanted to replace the original style, but as they’re apparently discontinued, I’m darned glad I did, as they are seemingly more comfortable & responsive. After shelling out just $10 less than what I paid for this one for a refurbished controller from GameStop (who are using trash tier parts to fix the exchanged ones), I found myself having to get this new model. I like using a Kontrol Freek Extender on the R thumbstick & a concave silicone cover on the L, but w/ the refurbished ones, they’re using thumstick replacements that are just a millimeter or 2 too small for the KF extenders & silicone covers. Without any thumbstick extender/cover, GS’s cheapo replacements just feel weird & made game play awful. Don’t get me started on how bad the buttons were as it’s infuriating enough to make you want to punch puppies! This new controller, as I said, is crazy comfortable & I swear the buttons respond better. The sharing button is pretty helpful too & as everyone & their mother is uploading videos or streaming their gameplay, it’s a right handy little addition. I’ve only used this for a few games, mostly for RDR2, but it definitely helped me to have that better, more comfy feel & responsiveness.\nNow for the downside: the Xbox “brand” & “off brand” rechargeable batteries are NOT working in it for me. To charge & connect these new controllers, you must have the newest USB-C cords! (Plenty of good deals are to be had here on Amazon for them. I got 2 10’, gold plated cords for $10) So that I am not ripping through conventional AA batteries, I have my USB-C cord plugged into a charger next to my couch. While I’m guessing Xbox is either needing to do some sort of update to make the old rechargeable batteries work in these, I’d bet dollars to doughnuts that they’re going to put out a new battery & cord combo for these. If you absolutely abhor using cords but don’t want to rip through batteries, invest in rechargeable AA ones until they sort out why the rechargeable battery packs aren’t working or come out w/ new ones. To make sure it wasn’t just my getting a faulty controller, a friend had also gotten one of these & have the same problem w/ not having the Xbox One rechargeable battery pack work in theirs. Aside from this, I can find nothing else negative about these & if you’re another “grinder” needing an upgrade to a controller that has drifting & having to mash the buttons to have them register, or a trigger or bumped button went on the wonk; I’m assured in my telling you to invest in one of these. I’m hoping the USB-C cord won’t develop the loosening up that the original micro-USB cords are notorious for.\nFor those looking for a TL; DR version of my endless drivel, these new controllers are:\nMore comfortable\nMore responsive\nNeed a USB-C cord\nDon’t work w/ Xbox nor offbrand rechargeable battery packs so get rechargeable AA batteries if you don’t want to be tethered.",

Of course with the Xbox one controller you need a wireless adapter (I play on PC) whereas the series controller just needs Bluetooth. Both are great options. They feel great in the hands. Dpad is okay, still better than the PlayStation one. The batteries are AA but you can use rechargeable ones like I do or just use a USB cable to plug it in (no batteries required)."

This cooling stand has dual fans at 4000rpm and a total of 2 ventilation holes close to each fan, comparing this to the other products I had tested made by Ovio, Cykoarmor, and even another Nexigo product, most of those products only has 1 ventilation hole with 1 fan, the other Ovio product has 2 fans, but its got poor ventilations. Unfortunately, all these cooling stands have weak fans, but at least this one has good ventilations which actually helps evacuate the heat from the console. This is unfortunately the best ps5 cooling stand in the market, I just wish it had stronger fans than 4000rpm. It would've been a perfect score, hopefully they make one with a 5000-6000rpm dual fans with this kind of ventilation system soon.",

You just switch Controllers that has a battery pack or just the battery pack itself and just like that your back in the game without missing a beat and at the cost of $24.99 it really saves you money on buying packs of batteries if you think about it and do the math, and who doesn't like saving money, I know I do. Also, huge shout out to Oivo for allowing me the opportunity to review and test out this product for you guys.\n\nSo With two different designs of battery covers, it can meet your needs with any XBox controller you have, You can simultaneously charge two controllers no matter what kind of XBox console their designated for. The small minimal design of the charging dock makes it an easy addition to any setup and doesn’t become an eyesore, plus the LED lights around the dock is most definitely a nice touch, if you ask me. Now Oivo has a lot of awesome affordable game accessories, just like this one to elevate your gaming and add a little bit of flare, without even breaking the bank, which I really love and appreciate, so do yourself a huge favor check out this item and many others on their website www.oivogames.com and here Amazon as well, you won’t regret it.",
                "2": "Very nice charging dock for my Xbox controllers, needed to find a charging dock to handle my Xbox elite controller and this works great. It comes with three different attachments covers for your battery packs so you can charge different types of controllers, Awesome options. Lights up nicely and looks nice and when the controls are charging in a port, a red controller light will appear showing which one is charging. I highly recommend this for your gaming charging needs very nice.",
                "3": "We were buying AA's so much I was worried about an EPA call. This has been great and saved us having to buy batteries and store them. Small enough to sit next to our TV and since it is USB-A, can plug into whatever comes to hand.",
                "4": "Works like advertised. Although I thought it was a wall mount for some reason. Looks and works great. Just wish I could charge my other batteries and not just the ones that come with it",
                "5": "So happy with this product and the batteries that came with it… easy to use and works perfectly… should of purchased this long ago!!",
                "6": "Batteries work and charge perfectly. Also looks much neater than controllers laying around the TV.",
                "7": "Lightweight and small. Easy to find a spot for. Super convenient as opposed to continuously buying expensive batteries. This product is a genius alternative.",
                "8": "Great product I still have it from purchase and very reliable",
                "9": "Works great so much better then using tons of batyeries that ends up costing so much money",
                "10": "The controllers don't always sit on the contacts without a couple taps to get them aligned. You have to watch and be sure the red \"charging\" light comes on before walking away. The kids have gotten the hang of doing it consistently now so it isn't a problem. I'm guessing they couldn't make the fit more automatic because they are trying to support multiple versions of controller."

                "1": "I love Zelda games and have been playing any of them I could get my hands on since a kid. Breath of the Wild was awesome. Tears of the Kingdom is the same Hyrule as in BOTW, so you know the graphics are amazing and the whole thing is very well done. That being said, the game play in Tears of the Kingdom is just frustrating and extremely stupidly time consuming. My 10 year old kept whining whenever I told him his time playing video games was up, and that the whole time he barely got anywhere in the game. I started to play it too and this game brought out much frustration in me as well. I usually enjoy gathering and perusing every part of a game, trying to complete every task the creators thought up, but TOFK is really driving me nuts and I just want to finish the tasks as quickly as possible- that's how long they take. As Link, the worst part is that there is a lot of walking back and forth with constant obstacles in the way. Like talk to character A, than B, than A, than C than A and B and oh, they are all forever away from each other with mountains in between. Then you have to build these stupid carts and gliders to get you places, and that takes FOREVER because if the item is not angled at the exact right spot, it doesn't work or falls apart super easily, so you end up angered and just give up to realize you spent 30 minutes doing absolutely nothing to progress you in the game. I wish they would just let you build a cart and save it to you inventory to save you hours! Then there's the \"depths\".... I want to shake whomever made that place and ask them what were they thinking. Its an area that is just full of impossible foes, hills and boulders and giant roots every 2 seconds, cliffs- all in pitch black where you have to light the darkness by throwing bright bloom seeds every 20 feet. There's also the \"gloom,\" which is a sludge that zaps your health that cant be recovered, that is in large patches that the only way to get through is to use, you guessed it, the time consuming vehicles-that don't go over said hills, cliffs, etc. so you drive 3 seconds, get off the cart to fix or move your vehicle over the the hill, only to drive it 4 more seconds and repeat the process. I hate the darkness because I could literally spend 3 hours roaming around and just going in circles all the while being assaulted by monsters that can kill Link in just a few hits because- oh, the darkness takes away hearts permanently until a light root is found- and those are a pain to find because the cliffs and trees and hills always block them from view.\nThe whole game is like that, just back and forth because the quests are just too time consuming to the point of being unenjoyable. So, unless you have literally nothing to do in life, I would avoid this one- especially if you have kids because they will be whining and crying about it constantly and drive you insane. I am to the point where I just want to quit it- that's how much this game frustrates me.\nI should note that my friend said the exact same thing, which is sad because they are first time Zelda gamers and she is starting to hate Zelda and wont buy it for her kids again. So Tears of the Kingdom is DEFINATELY NOT a great representor of the joy in the Zelda series.",
                "2": "I got this game for my son's 14th birthday by request, and he loves it. He's spent hours on it and really enjoys it! I've watched him play at the graphics and game play are very attractive to look at and it seems very detailed and in-depth!",

                "6": "I literally would cancel meetings and call out sick to work to play this game. It is incredibly addicting and will haunt you all night while you dream of picking apples and finding shrines. Best game ever!!!",
                "7": "Slight spoilers to review. Nothing major, no storyline spoilers.\n\nI've only played maybe 40% of the game and I haven't touched it in a while, apart from the archipelagos and underworld there isn't too much new, obviously the storyline is new but it's same concept, similar characters, similar character development. It feels really alike, and I get it wouldn't make much sense for the world to have changed but there isn't major reconstruction other than a few locations to the main map, despite several years passing in-game. I have felt a little bored at times, and really I'm only finding enjoyment finding the very tiny new changes to the current map, exploration of the archipelago can be fun with new bosses, the underground is a bit hard being easily one hit and its confusing and seems a little pointless to explore other than treasure. Obviously endgame takes place underground, and you can kind of force your way to endgame in the beginning of the game and I made it half way through the main boss as a beginner. It doesn't make much sense, enemy's before boss were op but the boss itself and minions were easily dodgeable and found methods of completing very quickly.\n\nOverall I guess it would be worth a play but not for full price, I'd only take advantage of this if it goes on discount, and nintendo is notorious for not discounting their games unfortunately. The game in my opinion is definitely not worth full price.\n\nOne last thing as a personal review I wanted to speculate all the people saying how frame-ratey the game is and I will say my game has choked up a bit on the switch and maybe it runs better on the oled, but I was having frame rate issues constantly and the quality hasn't upgraded much from the last one.\n\nAnyways that concludes my thoughts, it probably won't mean much but I'm a huge zelda fan and if you are too than maybe it'll be worth the extra storyline, etc. Maybe I'll edit this post when I fully play the game, who knows.",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "This is a pretty solid mount. It looks great and is sturdy. It fits well with the components and is easy to use. It is difficult to see the instructions as they are very small. The instructions show names for the parts but when it comes to building the mount they use different names for the parts. The hardware is adequate but could use some washers for the component mounting. All-in-all it’s a nice unit.",
                "2": "Looks sleek and does the job for my G29. Very easy to move the rig around. A bit tidious to take down and setup again but worth it. Very well built and my favorite features would be the platforms for the wheel and pedals can tilt. The instructions sucked but not hard to figure out.",
                "3": "It is a little wobbly at times. Putting it together was easy. Even though the instructions were a little odd. It works really well and I would recommend it at its sale price for sure. Wheel is nice and snug and the pedals dont move at all. The entire frame just wobbles slightly if you are aggressively steering. Overall I'm happy with it until I get a good racing chair.",
                "4": "This was sturdy and arrived faster thank expected. Directions were worthless! I found a video online to help me.",
                "5": "I'll start off by saying I saved a few dollars and bought a like-new unit, as I plan on modifying it at a later date. Even at an extremely laughable \"discounted\" price, I still overpaid.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Toss them out. The pictures are useless, the directions make no sense, and the steps make no sense. The only use I got from it was identifying bolt lengths. I had to figure out most of it on my own.\n\nTOOLS: It comes with two allen keys and two stamped wrenches. The larger allen key is ok, the small one is very small, but both seem to fit in the heads of their respective bolts ok. The wrenches are a waste of metal. They are too thin to be actually useful; the larger of the two was toast by the time I was on my 5th bolt. Ended up using pliers instead as I was too lazy to grab a wrench, but you will definitely want to snug things up because...\n\nHARDWARE: Seems decent, nothing stripped out. The instructions don't really tell you what goes where, kinda figured it out as I went along. The lengths on things are very odd and don't make much sense in their lengths. They included 4 washers for... somewhere?\n\nFITMENT: Pretty poor. I didn't have to modify anything to get it to fit, but the plate for the pedal is not cut to fit snugly in the unit. Some of the threaded holes needed extra persuasion to thread in. The holes that are drilled out are too large, so everything has a bit of slop even when fully tightened.\n\nFINISH: Again, I bought a returned unit. Even so, the paint/ powdercoat seems pretty good. I had some rubbing, as my unit arrived with the parts wrapped in bubble wrap and nothing else, and nothing seems to have worn to bare metal.\n\nOVERALL QUALITY: Seems ok for what it is, but could be priced lower like around the fifty dollar mark. Welds are sketchy and lacking, but I used it for 4 hours and it didn't fall apart yet.\n\nIn closing, its ok. Its not built to a high standard, and it is priced too high, but it should get the job done for light use. It does wobble, but not too much if you aren't doing it intentionally. I guess one of the upsides of that is the force feedback of my G29 transmits that movement to the shifter so it by proxy has some force feedback now.\n\nI plan on modifying it to suit my needs, as I primarily will use it to play American/ Euro Truck Sim and Snowrunner. Not sure how it will handle games like Forza or Dirt in its current out of the box state, but it does ease my wheel setup since now I just have to drag this thing out versus clamp everything to my desk. It will definitely need beefing up if you plan on using it hardcore, but as a weekend thing it should be ok for the time being.",
                "6": "The instructions being hard to follow is an exaggeration, although there is a YouTube video with instructions on assembling this stand that are much easier to follow. I feel that if you've ever assembled furniture from Walmart or Ikea and have common sense you'll be fine. The pieces are solid feeling steel and my Thrustmaster T248 wheel works perfectly when playing Gran Turismo 7 on my ps5. You can either clamp the wheel with the mechanism the steering wheel comes with like you would on a table or you can screw it into the tray with two screws that come with this stand. Everything lined up perfectly, but I would suggest two major things that I learned watching someone assemble it online:\n1: Attach the pedals after you setup the bottom base but before putting in the vertical arms that hold up the steering wheel tray arms. Pedals have to be screwed in from the bottom and it's easier to do it at this point before you put the heavy upper parts.\n\n2) Before sliding the two pieces that connect to the steering wheel plate into the steering wheel tray arms, put in the short plastic knob screws on both sides, this will help hold up the tray arms at the same height while you screw the tray into them, then when you've lined them up take out the knobs and adjust the tray to the height that you want the wheel at and put them back in.\n\nMy stand didn't slip or move around on my low carpet. It's a steal at under 100 dollars when most are double that. The pieces were dusty when i received them but looked new with no visible damage to them.",
                "7": "works great. needs better instructions, had to go to the web to watch video on how to put it together.",
                "8": "",
                "9": "",
                "10": " Firstly - I don't know HOW these people are breaking the welds on the shifter arm, but I think my video speaks for itself. I was VERY worried about that, given that some H-Position shifters require you to push down to \"lock in\" the reverse gear. As you can see the force necessary, as well as QUITE a bit more is NOT a problem for this stand. I'm really not sure what other people are doing, but this one particularly is pretty solid despite the horrendous spot welds they didn't even clean up.\n\nFit and Finish: Not bad, could be better. Leaves a little too much wiggle room for my liking, but it's also one of the cheapest stands on the market that actually LOOKS decently equipped for the task. I had some paint chipped off here and there, and one of the plastic sleeves for the height adjustment was a bit disfigured, but a little heat took care of that.\n\nQuality for the price: Honestly probably better than several more expensive options out there. Yes, it will wiggle left and right, and slightly forward when pushed; and honestly that's NOT a bad thing. There's a reason that bridges move in the wind! When you're talking about the rigidity of an object it NEEDS to be able to move if there's force applied, otherwise it'll just break QUICKER.\n\nAlignment: Worked out perfectly for my particular use case, and situation; but it IS made in china - as most things on amazon are now a day - so there's going to be quality control issues, so be prepared for those.\n\nInstructions: Dog poop - Just toss them, and watch the video they have in the description or use the guide that was posted in the reviews by the other user. Theirs - even revised as mine were - are TERRIBLY written and literally say things like \" this bolt goes on one side while this bolt goes on the other\" Oh, okay, because I guess they're just freaking interchangeable, right? NOPE. Just poor translations at their best.\n\nLife Expectancy: I'm not honestly sure, but I am pretty certain that if you're not using this for some INSANE drifting sessions in DIRT and are using it for F1, Nascar, ETS, ETS2, ATS, etc. where you don't really SLING the steering wheel a lot and SLAM gears you should be fine for several years.",
                "11": "The only cons is that it'll lean toward the driver when making turns or applying down pressure (reversing on the shifter). The solution was to apply a 10-pound weight to the end and adjust the anti-slip legs so that the two legs facing the driver were higher than the outermost legs. This stability issue also caused the wheel to be wonky when steering fast. After these adjustments, it works well.\nA second potential con is that it lacks mounting holes for the wheelbase if the user mounts the wheel as you would on a desk. This means that one would have to have a good portion of the wheel extended forwards to be able to mount the wheel with screws. I feel this would cause potential damage while also contributing to the stability issues noted above.\nOverall, for the price point, it is worth it.",
                "12": "The instructions were pretty bad. Luckily there are a couple YouTube videos that do a good job in demonstrating how to put it together. The one from the seller isn't that great either though. So look at a few before starting to put it together.\n\nIn use it works as it should. It’s obviously not as good as a higher end, more expensive stand but it is really good for the price. It’s sturdy and it can easily be put away when not in use."

                "1": "If I could, I think I would give it a 4 1/2 star rating, but mostly it's a solid headset for the price.\n\nI had a Hyper X Cloud II headset that finally broke, and I've been going on a headset quest to see if I can find a cheaper, same high quality headset. I'm actually returning this one because of a couple of things that I personally don't like, but overall this was my third new headset and a pretty good one.\n\nPros: sound quality; comfort; looks cool; no issues with mic; cord length and options were good; sturdiness; and volume control in the cord. Normally $59-79. I bought it used for $49 and I had no issues with the quality or look. It seemed brand new still. The volume control worked well, easily moved when you adjusted it, and was tight enough to not move when bumped\n\nThe \"cooling\" quality of the headset seemed ok. Nothing extraordinary, but nothing wrong with it either.\n\nCONS:\n-it touts being \"glasses friendly\", but I found the padding on the ears pulled my glasses around with it when it moved, which is pure annoying. This is the only headset that i've bought so far that specifically states that it's comfortable for glasses, but I found it to be the opposite.\n\n-I don't think I like round headphones as much as oval kinds either. When they're round there's more room for the headphones to move around in my opinion, which I don't want., and which happened. These headphones also slide on the hair around my ears, which makes noise that I can hear because it's amplifed from having my ears covered, and also causes them to move around too much. If you have shorter hair it might not be a problem.\n\nDespite the things I didn't like, I would probably keep these if I didn't like my Hyper X Cloud II's so much and wanted to try another pair.\n\n*Side Note: I cant stress this enough, but try used headsets instead of buying new (unless you're just buying $20 headsets then it doesn't matter). I bought two used headsets recently, including these Kraken for about $25 less than the price for a new one, and I highly recommend going that route, especially if you find one sold through amazon that still qualifies for Prime and you can get it quickly. Both were in great condition, and I'm going to buy a third headset since they'll be about $40 cheaper than the sale price right now.\n\nOne of them had a damaged box because some idiot didn't know how to open it, but other than that these didn't even have a scratch on them, and if you don't like them you get something like 90 days to return them for a full refund. Usually I got my refund within hours, but it might take a few days in some cases.\n(edited: I forgot, I also live in Seattle, so returning something can be way faster up here than in other places. That's why most of my returns only take a few hours to get my money back.)",
                "2": "The hardware in the Krakens is excellent, imo. My husband loves these phones (and I do, too!) My previous phones, a pair of Sony MDR-7506's, were so good we thought nothing could beat them, even though the Sony phones' drivers are 40 mms in size and these Razer Kraken drivers are 50mm--much depends on the amplification hardware in the ear pads and motherboard hardware as to which will drive the better sound--eg., 50 mm drivers are not automatically better than 40mm drivers, regardless of the hardware environments. A lot also depends on the preferences of the individuals asked to state their opinions, of course. Some people like bass so overwhelming it actually distorts whereas other people like it only enough to hear it plainly with no distortion, and others like it turned down or off, inexplicably, etc. (But you can't argue with individual opinions, right?...Opinions are like armpits--we all have at least two of them, eh? So, I advise listening to all sides and colors of opinions, especially about computer hardware! There's always something new to learn even we don't agree with the overall opinions other people have or their conclusions. Opinions should always be debated--never, ever censored, we firmly believe!)\n\nBear in mind, both sets of phones were tested via my husband's x570 Aorus Master motherboard's RealTek'HD Audio 3.5mm analog Hi-Definition front-panel jack--the best earphone connection jack in the system, btw. (Give me wired over wireless any day--I hate batteries and frequency interference, not to mention security concerns that do not exist with wired connections, etc.) The x570 Master also supports, in hardware, a 3-position headphone amp, and a hardware DAC, a SABRE 9118 DAC--the combination has to be heard to be properly appreciated, imo.\n\nConnector cabling. The Kraken offers a superior wiring connection--Kraken uses an extremely thin and ultra-flexible braided connector cable, whereas the Sony offers a thick, plastic-covered connection cable in which most of the length is coiled, just like analog amp cables circa the 1960's were made. Indeed, the Sony cabling doesn't look like something made for a 3.5mm plug! It looks exactly like something made for a full size plug! It's opinion, sure, as everything always is in the end, but we much prefer the Kraken's cabling over that used in the Sony cans used as the baseline comparison for this review. The Kraken cabling is ultralight, ultrathin, cloth braided, and so ultra-flexible that there simply isn't any obstinate stiffness in the cable that can be perceived. We both like it very much because of that--it is the nearest thing to not having a cable at all, but without any of the negatives of wireless. Sony's cabling is--well--SoA, circa 1969...;) Reminds my husband of plugging in his ancient but revered Gibson SG-Specials or Fender Strats & Telecasters into nice big onstage amps (which he still does, only the amps are a fair bit smaller, thankfully...;) )\n\nRazer Kraken has an inline volume and microphone control switch. The Sony has neither--well, it doesn't have a microphone at all, so of course no Mic on/off switch. The Kraken has a nice, radial volume control for the cans, and a straight on-off switch for the Mic. Neither of us is a Mic user, so I'll leave that portion of the review to others better qualified to write about it in another review. Suffice it to say the Mic works as advertised and the on/off inline switch works fine.\n\nNow for the optional DSP software. Here's the situation as we think it stands regarding the extra-cost surround software available for the Kraken, the THX Spatial Audio software for the Kraken. We don't recommend anyone buying the Headphones without buying the offered THX Spatial Audio software! It's offered at 50% off when you buy the Kraken Phones, by Razer. So it's $10! It's the best $10 you are going to spend for a long time. We believe that these phones should not be offered sans the THX Spatial Audio--it's kind of baffling that they are offered without the custom THX software, frankly. However, there are people who love distorted bass and volumes so loud that King Kong's eardrums would burst!...;) So maybe that's why Razer doesn't integrate this into this Kraken package. Still, it would be unusual to find earphone wearers who would prefer their games sounding like an avalanche of boulders tumbling down the side of Everest. I think, anyway...;)\n\nTo sum it up--I love this software. Husband loves it. He says it's much better than what he thought it might be. Razer includes a 7.1 surround-sound software solution free of charge with the Kraken, and it's just \"OK\"--just kind of average--seems to induce a fair bit of bass distortion in speech in some of our games--one guy's speech is nigh unintelligible with the Razer 7.1 surround sound package for the Krakens. But run the THX Spatial Audio, instead, and the difference is real and immediately noticeable. THX really justifies its commercial claims--the software brings out the best in the Kraken hardware!\n\nComfort. It's a very important category with cans--as all of us know. If you can't game for hours because your phones are causing you pain or discomfort after a certain wearing time--that's unacceptable. These Kraken phones have \"Oval Cooling Gel Cushions\" in the pads and I'm just going to say that they are very comfortable indeed. My husband says that this set is the most comfortable set of cans he's ever worn. Both of us think the Sony set tends to \"pinch\" a bit in a long wear. The Sony pads are by no means uncomfortable, absolutely not. But both of us--my husband's typically swelled head and my petite but usually swifter smaller head both find the Krakens more comfortable in all wear scenarios--which I find a bit unusual. My husband says that what surprises him about the Krakens in addition to the gel-filled ear pads is how comfortable they feel--even for a large head like his they feel like they've got more room to give--not something the Sony's ever did. The Sony's were adequate, just not as comfortable.\n\nDurability. This is a big one for us, but especially for my husband. He's gone through many Plasticine sets of cans promising great durability. Hah. We have lost count of the very strong-looking plastic-frame headsets that after very little use, comparatively, use that was anything but harsh or abusive, simply fell apart, cracking through or breaking apart, and it happened over and over again. Hence, the hunt for metal headbands and construction in our headphones. Both the Sony and the Razer Kraken use metal in their construction, and what a difference! Neither set has come close to cracking or breaking apart! The Sony's have been up for years without a single problem in that regard! Years, literally. We do not expect to see any less durability from our Razer Kraken--namely, the one reviewed in this article!\n\nReally, any aluminum-headband construction should suffice for a long, long time. Our advice is to avoid plastic like the plague--especially the plastic headbands that appear to hold massive weight and hold up under enormous wear and tear--especially those particular Plasticine headbands....;) They just aren't going to be there one day when you really need them.\n\nPrice: Believe it or not, the Sony cans are actually priced higher than the Kraken headset reviewed here. You can usually buy the Kraken Gaming Headset reviewed here plus the Razer THX Spatial Audio Software for less--that's right--less than what the MDR-7506 is currently selling for in places such as AMAZON! Where you are right now.\n\nSummary: The Sony cans, the MDR-7506's used as a baseline comparison for the Razer Kraken Gaming Headset review here, deliver really nice sound and were our number 1 choice in gaming headphones. Operative word being \"were\"....! These Razer Kraken headphones are better, in our very humble, sincere opinions!",
                "3": "I’ve had these headphones for over a month now because I really wanted to try them before, I write a review. I am happy I decided to get these because they have completely enhanced my gaming experience.\nThese headphones are great and cheap for those who don’t want to spend over $100 for some headphones to game with. For a non-professional gamer more than happy with these headphones. The surround sound lets me know which direction an enemy is coming at me from. This alone has saved me multiple times from attackers from behind me.\nThe durability of these headphones feels like they can handle a lot. When not in use I just put them away until I’m ready to use them again. They did come with a little dent on the top of the band but did not affect the playability in any way. They also feel comfortable and don’t cause fatigue when playing for long periods of time. I’ve played up to 6 hours in 1 setting and had no problem with the headphones on.\nThe noise cancelation is good but does not cancel 100% of outside noise. I’d rather have some headphones that let me be emersed in a game but can still hear a little of what’s going on in my surroundings. When playing with others I can hear the game and team members’ voices just fine. I was told by a teammate that they could hear a lot of wind noise, and the only thing around was the ceiling fan on max. It's not a loud fan but I guess the air was enough to be picked up by the mic.\nOverall, I’m thrilled with these headphones, I even plan on buying a pair for my son. Also, it may not matter but I’ve used these headphones while playing Elden Ring, Destiny 2, Spider-Man, and Back4Blood so far.",
                "4": "▶️ tldr; I bought these the Pink Kraken headphones for my daughter to use with her gaming setup. She liked them and they matched the rest of the pink gaming stuff. They were nice for her to use. I would recommend them for kids and people not real concerned about quality of sound or any discernment for being an audiophile/gamer. They are built well enough to be used as a daily pair of headphones without too many issues. I wouldn't spend a fortune getting Razer products though for reasons stated in my review below.\n\n▶️ Long review:\nDrawing on my experience owning a dozen and a half Razer products and being an early adopter of many, including the Razer COVID-19 RGB face mask, I have some concerns that I want to share. Despite the hardware being of \"good\" quality, I have decided to stop using Razer products due the following... the software is intrusive and bloatware-like, which can slow down my computer's startup times and memory usage. In addition, Razer's software is often CPU & memory-heavy, causing issues when trying to use other equipment like my HP Mixed Reality VR equipment. Unfortunately, poor customer service and eventual buyers remorse for their \"higher quality products\" have also contributed to my decision. I've also noticed that Razer tends to exaggerate the quality of their products on their product pages. Another issue that I encountered with Razer over the years was their customer service. I found their customer service to be obnoxious, unhelpful and rude at times.\n\nTheir headphones provide OK sound quality, I have found that the THX sound experience is not as realistic as Razer makes it out to be. You literally have front of you facing sound and kind of / sort of middle rear facing sound. It's really not as big of a deal as Razer makes it out to be. It's an exaggerated over embleshisment of what it really is.\n\nDon't be fooled by Razer's claims about THX on their heaphones. It's not worth it. I own multiple pairs of Razer headphones and they don't even come close to what I have with Corsair headphones. The bloatware software Razer provides can be tricky to use and never could figure out how to the surround sound effect to exist (I am an avid gamer/computer tech/computer programmer/music lover) but even with all the things I know about computers, I never could manage to get it to work. As far as I was concerend It was just 2 areas of sound (front and rear) -- nothing like real surround sound or whatever they claim THX can do for you.\n\nI still consider Razer to be a producer of quality products. If you're looking to settle for something versus nothing, Razer products could be a good option if the price is right. Razer's unboxing experience is top-notch, and the RGB lights and effects are cool (based on what you buy from them). While I don't hate Razer, I no longer use their products due to the quality of their software, their customer service being garbage and unhelpful, and they tend to exaggerate the quality of their products on their website. If you're in the market for a new product and are looking to settle, Razer products could be a good option. Just be mindful how much you are spending and what kind of expectations you have going into it.\n\nRazer = longer term eventual disappointment once the honeymoon period is over, as far as I'm concerned.\n\n▶️ Alternative Product Recommendation:\nIf you want to really want an upgrade to your headphones, comfort and sound quality... I highly recommend the Corsair Virtuoso RGB Wireless XT High Fidelity Dolby Atmos Sound headphones ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BXZKNDB ).\n\nBuy them used from \"Amazon Warehouse\" in \"Used - Like New\" condition if want to get them cheap ($130) and know you're getting high quality / audiophile level quality sound. They actually provide high-quality Dolby Atmos sound and are reasonably price on Amazon if buy them used in \"LIKE NEW\" condition.\n\nSince mine were used I bought new, better ear cushions ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B095GS943G ) for them which made them even more comfortable and better at noise cancellation.",
                "5": "Kraken as a brand is known for making quality products that are functional, comfortable, and durable. The noise cancelling earpieces do a good job blocking out sound, and keeping your ears warm.\n\nThe product comes as two separate parts: The audio controller (USB to 3.5) and the headset itself, which has a 3.5mm jack that plugs in at a 90 degree angle. I'll talk about the headset first.\n\nThe headset uses quality fabric from top to bottom, a synthetic leather on top of the headband, with a more cushioned, lattice pattern fabric on bottom. The padding is very breathable and comfortable, so you don't need to worry about the headset slipping off when using them, barring the most excessive headbanging.\n\nThe foam they use is a very soft, flexible kind of foam, so you don't need to worry about having the earpieces bite into any eyewear you are wearing. The extendable microphone has a soft arm, which means you can bend it to get the perfect angle for any face.\n\nAdditionally, the audio quality is great for general use, meaning you'll get a good quality mic whether you're using it on console, PC or even mobile. When not in use, the microphone can be pushed back into the headset frame, making it very much out of your way when you're trying to enjoy some music.\n\nThe headset has a barebones, inline volume dial and mute toggle. Both have held up after extensive (+1 year) usage in tandem with the audio controller. The wire used is a not very thick, but dense enough braid, so you won't have to worry about wire crimping or getting tangled in a travel bag or other container.\n\nBefore we get started talking about the audio controller I'm going to be talking about the hardware, not the software currently, as while Razer is amazing a producing a great product, the software is notorious for several issues. The audio controller is a very small profile box at the end of a braided cable with a USB plugin. The box has buttons to raise and lower volume in general, a mute button that glows red when muted, and for the two audio channels the drivers for the device (without the software) create; game and chat.\n\nThe two channels have two small actuators that return to a neutral position after adjusting volume for the respective channel. Finally, the audio controller has a button to enable THX spatial audio.\n\nThe headset is 5.1 compatible for anyone wondering, and that should be good enough to satisfy most everyone.\n\nThe major downsides are typically Razer's software. Most of my issues with razer have been drivers following a patch, typically requiring you to go into settings for all apps using audio settings, or have certain features not work for all setups.\n\nFrequently the default THX audio settings don't work, and audio doesn't separate into the two channels properly. All audio funnels into the chat channel for me personally, but there have been anecdotes of people having no issues getting it working.\n\nOverall, great hardware, just don't expect the full functionality the software claims. Treat it as a fancy UI and a way to keep your drivers updated, and you'll be happy.",
                "6": "So so cute! I like everything about these. The sound is great and accommodates surround/directional sound. I wouldn't really say they're noise cancelling but they do drown out a lot of the surrounding noise, just not quite everything. The cushions on the ears are nice and big and super squishy and comfy, they go around my ears almost completely instead of resting on them. The head bar is also quite comfy, not quite as soft but definitely softer than some others I've tried. Very adjustable and not slippy so they won't click out of the adjusted height mid game. The retractable adjustable mic is a nice feature that I don't see often. I was worried it would wear down or break a wire or connection with repeated retraction but it seems to be holding up well. The mic quality it pretty good too and my friend can hear me a lot better than with my last headset. It does pick up a lot though so make sure you don't have any fans or anything near by because that will get picked up and transmitted. I especially like that the jack is L shaped and not straight out. It makes it easier to hold the controller in my lap without worrying about breaking/fraying the cord or jack. I also like the braided cord, it's very solid and durable, and the mute button and volume wheel on the cord are easy to use and intuitive. Overall a very good purchase, I would recommend to others (and will probably be purchasing another set for my partner!)",
                "7": "Got the pair of Razer Kraken 2019 Black while it was on sale for around $60 bucks to replace my old pair of Razer Carcharias from back in 2010 and it is definitely a large step up over those pair. It works as intended and I believe the pricing is fair for what it is suppose to do. Always appreciated the non-RGB clean/stealth look the black pair provides and it looks great paired with my razer orochi and razer arctosa (black ver.). Haven't had any problems with the audio quality besides a mediocre bass but the added support of the 7.1 Surround Sound software from Razer works fantastic and makes up for that. You will need to register the product onto your RazerID in order to receive an activation code for the 7.1 Surround Sound software from Razer. Comfort is great and way better than I had thought especially with the cooling gel cushion feature that the ear pads provide but it doesn't necessarily nullify all the heat, it does still get warm from hours on end of usage but that's unavoidable and expected from wearing these sort of gaming headset. Mic works great and is actually way better than I had imagined. No complaints overall besides the sub par bass and maybe some connective issues that is easily resolved by either resetting your PC or replugging the audio jack a few times. I would test out if the headset is properly connected by listening to a few sound tests whenever I encountered this issue but that has only happened once. Shouldn't be a deterring factor honestly.\n\nOverall, I really do enjoy these headset quite a bit and it works as it is suppose to. It's not necessarily the best music listening headphones and it is not the worst but it gets the job done. It's definitely well worth it if you you ever get a chance to see the headset on sale but regardless it's a fairly priced product at $80. But if you are a fan of razer products and understand the ecosystem such as using razer synapse and/or just like how it looks, I would definitely grab a pair!",
                "8": "I really love this headset and the quality of it and that it sounds great for the quality of the headset. Mic works very well and a little difficult at first to setup for the mic but got it work. I definitely recommend this gaming headset and has great quality for the sound and mic. Definitely worth it!",
                "9": "=== Update January 23, 2021 ===\n\nAfter months of struggling with Razer's unacceptably bad customer support, I finally got a replacement for my headset. Everything I love about these headphones still stands (comfortable, padded metal headband, good sound), and now, with the replacement, the mute button doesn't generate a loud staticky noise for people on the other end. I feel confident that I can use my headphones for work.\n\nGood customer support is key to repeat customers and word of mouth. I normally have excellent experiences with customer support because I'm polite and treat the support people like the human beings they are. I can't explain why Razer's support is so terrible. I find myself wondering if it's designed to make people give up on getting service.\n\nBottom line: read the reviews. Find a company with better customer support.\n\n=== Update January 12, 2021 ===\n\nTL;DR The headset's mute button has a known flaw that sends a staticky noise to anyone on the other end. Getting my headset replaced by Razer under warranty has been an ongoing saga. I recommend any other headset than this one. You might be lucky and get a great headset without the mute button flaw. But if you aren't lucky, you'll need the patience of Job to deal with Razer customer support.\n\nHere's what's been happening: Razer has opened three warranty support cases, telling me I have 30 days to return my headset. In the first two cases, after many emails from me to them about problems with FedEx rejecting the tracking labels, they closed the cases before the 30-day time period had expired. In the most recent case, they closed it after only 11 days.\n\nEach time they closed my case, I called Razer again. The tech support persons acknowledged that the cases had been closed too soon, but said there was nothing to do but open a new case, with all the time-consuming emails and proofs of purchase that a new case entails.\n\nLatest incident/case: On January 1, 2021, Razer opened a third warranty support case, and then closed it on January 12. In this case, they claimed they emailed me another return label, but that I hadn't used it within the 14 days allotted for the label, so they were closing the case. (Math doesn't seem to be their strong suit.) But although I checked all possible email accounts and folders, including the spam folders, I didn't see the label. I emailed Razer three times asking for them to re-send the label, and they didn't.\n\nI'm mind-boggled. I normally have excellent experiences with tech support and customer support, even with companies that are notorious for bad tech/customer support.\n\nI called Razer again today to see if I can get this straightened out. At least this time they aren't opening a new case, and they sent me a label, so there's that. Here's hoping I get a replacement without the mute button flaw. If I do, I'll give the headset more stars, but I can't in all good conscience give their customer support anything but zero stars.\n\n=== 12/31/2020 update ===\n\nSo the replacement process for the second case proceeded exactly as the first one did. Many emails back and forth with Razer, me asking for help with my FedEx tracking label, the responses ignoring my requests. (The FedEx website kept telling me the tracking number was invalid. I didn't want to take the package to a drop-off box if the tracking number was invalid.)\n\nOnce again, the tech support person handling my case closed the case early, claiming it was because 14 days had passed on the RMA. It's true that more than 14 days had passed, but as before, in multiple emails, they said I had 30 days.\n\nI called Razer today and spoke with a support person. He said my case should not have been closed (because, obvs, it's not January 3 yet). He cheerfully opened yet another case for me. We'll see how well this goes.\n\nBy the way, if you're having the same trouble, I finally figured out the FedEx problem--you have to call FedEx and speak with a person. You can't use their automated phone scheduling and you can't use their website. I don't know why Razer didn't tell me this the many times I asked them about it.\n\nAlthough the headset is good quality overall, the mute button problem makes it unacceptable for professional work. The headset has been sitting in a box to be returned to Razer since October, and meanwhile I've been making do with my decrepit backup headset.\n\n=== Original review November 2020===\nI use my headset every day for work, and I've been buying inexpensive Logitechs, which are good but wear out in a year. So this year I treated myself to a more expensive headset.\n\nI love the look of this headset, and I love how comfortable the earpieces are. The sound is good and the noise-cancelling is excellent.\n\nHowever, from the very outset, people on the other end of a call complained of an irritating staticky noise every time I used the mute button. I looked it up and found many reviews in which this same problem was mentioned. Of course, this is unacceptable in a professional environment. The last thing you want to do is to generate an irritating noise while discussing important, tricky issues with your boss or co-workers.\n\nBottom line: getting the headset replaced by Razer under warranty has been an ongoing saga. I recommend any other headset than this one. You might be lucky and get a great headset without the mute button flaw. But if you aren't lucky, you'll need the patience of Job to deal with Razer customer support.\n\nHere are the details of my interactions with Razer.\n\nOn October 7, 2020, I started the RMA process with Razer. After almost a month of emails back and forth in which they asked for a lot of testing on my end, they agreed to replace the headset. They issued an RMA and a FedEx shipping label on November 9. They told me the RMA would stay open for 30 days from the day it was opened. Take note of that; it's important.\n\nUnfortunately, the email with the label went into my spam folder. Since I was receiving all their other emails, I had no reason to expect it to go to spam. I emailed Razer asking the status and they weren't helpful. It took me over a week to find the label email. I emailed them again saying I'd finally found it, and asking for help on the return, since they included only the instruction that I must return everything that had come in the box.\n\nAfter many email exchanges with no adequate answers from Razer, I contacted FedEx to arrange a pickup. FedEx said the tracking number was invalid. I emailed Razer several times telling them that. Razor kept responding by saying it was either my error or a problem with FedEx. They advised me to contact FedEx for help. I finally emailed them on November 24 asking them point-blank if the tracking number had expired, and if so, could they send a new one. I got this response on November 28.\n\n\"Upon further checking your case, your prepaid shipping label with the tracking number, XXXX was created last 11/09/2020 and is still not used until now. However, please be advised that both your RMA XXXX and shipping label are already expired since it's already beyond 14 days from the date it was created. Our RMA is only valid for 14 days from the date it was provided. Please be informed that I will now close the case and RMA. This case is now considered closed. Since the RMA and shipping label are already expired, please contact our Technical Support team for a new case, new RMA and new shipping label to be provided to you. Don't worry, they will be able to assist you to schedule a pickup using a new shipping label.\"\n\nAt this point I feel like I was getting the run around and experiencing delaying tactics, especially the support person said my RMA had expired, but they had earlier said my RMA would be open for 30 days, and that it was the _label_ that would expire in 14 days. November 28 is NOT 30 days from November 9.\n\nI was tempted to give up, and it feels like that's exactly what they want me to do, but instead I persevered and contacted Razer on 12/3 to restart the RMA process.\n\nI hope I will get a replacement product that doesn't have the staticky sound when using the mute button. I'll keep you posted.",
                "10": "I'm writing this review after using this headset almost daily for work and gaming for a little under two years now. I bought these for gaming, streaming, and work. Let me start off by saying they look adorable and seem to be sturdy, but the quality is definitely lacking and I generally wouldn't recommend them to anyone who is trying to use them as a full headset, maybe as just headphones, but definitely not if they need to use the mic.\n\n-------------Quick Summary-------------------------------------\nPROS: Cute, extension cord is handy (sometimes), comfortable enough to wear all day, sound quality is decent, separate volume knob on the headphones is convenient sometimes\nCONS: Mic quality is god awful, the mute button broke pretty quickly and I almost couldn't get it to unmute, headset is too loose and heavy to do any kind of physical activity or even lean forward without them falling off, extension cord is split between input and output so it can't be used as both input and output through one headphone jack i.e. for my laptop\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI was really attracted to these because they are cute, and there weren't too many options for pink headphones, and I really wanted to look cute for Twitch streaming and Zoom/Discord calls. Let me start by saying I have beat the crap out of these and they still work, but a lot of the features I liked broke or stopped working well after a few months and then I stopped caring about being gentle with them.\n\nMost notably, the mute button/volume dial, it is so poorly constructed, you can feel the plastic moving around. The mute button itself often didn't mute or would get stuck muted, or half muted where it would make a humming or interference noise for people in my voice calls. It finally stopped working entirely after a few months and almost got stuck in the muted position. It was never reliable which lead to some embarrassing situations where I thought I was muted and I was NOT. There are also ridges on the volume adjustment that often get caught on clothing and it turns itself down or all the way up and I have to double check it. Ideally it would have been better if Razer put these buttons on the headset itself instead. It was nice to have volume control separate but it was more annoying than beneficial most of the time. It doesn't really have any amount of noise cancelling or anything, it feels similar to wearing earmuffs for the winter, I can still hear everything it's just a little muffled.\n\nThe mic on this headset is absolutely awful and I would NOT recommend anyone rely on it for quality voice input. I don't know if it's just built badly or if mine is slowly getting worse over time but I have a lot of complaints about the mic. First off, the mic picks up sound coming from your earphones, I feel like that should be a basic requirement for a headset to not do that.... I have to have the volume very quiet in order to avoid the mic picking up what I am listening to. This is worse while the mic is pushed in to the headset, and only a little better when you pull the mic out to be near your mouth, but it still happens so it kind of defeats the purpose of having a headset. There has been more than one occasion where my music was picked up in a meeting by my mic, so again very embarrassing situations sometimes. There is zero consistency on mic pickup volume, I have used this for Zoom, Discord, BlueJeans, Facebook Video, Twitch, OBS, and regular phone calls, and all of them have wildly differing volumes of pickup. I use Zoom and Discord the most. On Zoom the mic seems to be supersonic and can pick up sounds across the room, when I'm on Discord on the same computer I have my input boosted and have the mic literally touching my mouth and my friends can barely hear me most of the time, it is so frustrating. Annoyingly this changes frequently, a few weeks ago I was too loud on Discord despite not changing any settings and then this week I am too soft despite being boosted all the way up. If I use the extension cord it changes the whole situation again to where I am having to adjust my settings and test my mic constantly. The extension cord itself is nice but I almost never use it as it is split into input and output only, so I can't use these as a headset on things with a singular audio jack like my laptop and phone which is 90% of my usage.\n\nPhysically the headset feels sturdy, and I have dropped it more times than I care to admit, but overall the headset is heavy because the metal ear cups and headband, making it slip and slide off if I lean down to pick something up. If I shake my head with any amount of force the headset slips right off, so I can't wear it for anything but sitting at my desk, I have to switch to my old Sony bluetooth headphones if I want to work out, which I don't think I was looking for these to be an all in one solution for me, but it's still disappointing to take a phone call and have to constantly adjust these on my head if I do any amount of movement. It's comfortable to wear all day for sure, and I wear glasses so that's an achievement.\n\nThe sound quality is decent, I can't really complain about that.\n\nOverall I would say these weren't worth the purchase. Granted the price point is pretty low for a corded headset but it is a constant headache to adjust the mic settings on every application. I would not purchase these again if I was in the market for a decently priced headset. They are cute and trendy, but really only work well as headphones if you sit still all day."

                "1": "It took me a moment to truly appreciate this game,I had just finished playing Tears of the Kingdom and jumping from a very open experience to a liners one took a bit of getting used to. I was under the wrong impression thay FF16 was open world so kt took me off guard when I found the opposite.\n\nThat being said, I still gave it a chance and im so glad I did. Some of my most favorite games of all time didn't click with me instantly, and so was the case with this one.\n\nFinal Fantasy 16 harkens back the series' core while still adding a refreshingly new experience. Avid fans will recognize music motifs from older titles interwoven into the new tracks in a beautiful way. The music of this game is incredible and deserving of the Best Music VGA(I hope it's nominated!). We also get to explore the crystal them of the games in a brand new and unexpected way that I had never seen in the crystal-driven stories from previous titles.\n\nThe world building is very solid and I adore how crystals are integrated into every day lives like drying clothes using wind magic or keep fish fresh using ice magic via crystals. It's a simple detail but it breaths so much life into the world and you don't usually see how magic affects every day lives in games.\n\nI've been enjoying the gameplay so much. It's not an ultra challenging experience but that's ok. Not every game needs to be a soulsborne to be good. The game makes up for this by letting you replay stages to get ranks based on how well you performed and there are difficulty modes available for new game plus players and for the challenges or so I am go understand. I am yet to play challenges so I'm not sure how it works, been focusing on the main campaign and side quests first.\n\nThe story is amazing, deep and fresh. I've been loving the narrarive of this game, and the linearity really strengthens the storytelling. The side quests start out feeling like filler but quickly become into informative and impactful world building moments.\n\nI'm in the endgame segment and I'm loving every moment of this game. One of my favorite games of all time, and in top 5 Final Fantasy titles. A true attestation to how games don't need to be open world to be great, and how linear games shouldn't be frowned upon.",
                "2": "I don’t understand what a Final Fantasy game is and I’ve played quite a few of them, nostalgia harmed this game, reminds me of the backlash surround Metal Gear Rising when it came out.\n\nBack to the game, it’s gorgeous, by far one of the most pretty games I’ve every had the honor of witnessing, play it on an HDR mini led tv and it’s amazing. The gameplay is very reminiscent of an easier Devil May Cry, but it’s very fun and feels great once you’ve grasped the gameplay. The Eikon fights were insane, just constant upwards insanity and it was the most fun I’ve had in a long time playing games. Honestly that’s what I felt when playing FFXVI, it was FUN, the story was also well written and overall I liked the different direction that this game went with. I recommend you play the game not as a FF game because it seems that is hurting it somehow. Play it as a game, it’s worth it for the fun factor alone.",
                "3": "First off while it won’t affect my review of the game, the delivery was awful. It came early but the case was badly damaged like it had been crushed and thrown around.\nNow the game, holy crap. This game definitely does not start slow. The prologue will get you hooked on the story right away. Literally can’t say anything about it or I’ll spoil something but it’s really good. Gameplay and combat was done by Platinumgames (Bayonetta, Nier Automata) and the Devil May Cry designer. So the gameplay is action packed and fast paced. That will be hit or miss for a lot of people. I don’t mind it. The cons are the fact that in graphics mode the game is locked at 30fps which is fine but even with motion blur set to 0 moving the camera in graphics mode is choppy as all hell. It looks like a slideshow. Performance mode has a target 60fps but it doesn’t really consistently hit it. So it’s down to choosing between a choppy camera that can make you sick and strain your eyes, or a highly variable frame rate that can make you sick and strain your eyes. I chose to stick with performance and I’d recommend anyone playing does the same. I can’t overstate how bad the choppiness on graphics mode is with the camera. The graphics aren’t really noticeably worse in performance mode aside from lens flares seemingly being a little less bright. Overall so far I’d say it’s well worth the $60 I paid and is definitely a must buy.",
                "4": "I definitely wasn't the prime demographic for a lot of the final fantasies in the last 15-20 years and when on deep discount or sale I would buy them and play maybe a few hours. But this game.... one of the best games I've played in a long time, let alone for a final fantasy game. A lot of cut scenes, but the gameplay is really fun and challenging. Very engaging and rewarding. This is like an interactive movie, great story and pulls a lot of classic lore and easter eggs from FF's prior. Can't be happier with this purchase. I love how they've branched out and tried different things in recent years. Not a huge souls-like fan, but also this game inspires me to give Stranger of Paradise another go pretty soon. Definitely not open world, but the narrative and story line is so fun.",
                "5": "This game - where to start? Just finished it tonight. I don't know if anyone will read this late review but hope it helps someone. I just can't spend as much time as I used to playing games.\n\nOverall - I would rank this game the same as Final Fantasy 15. But the reasons why vary quite a bit. If you want to read no further I would say FF16 has a better story, but not as good \"playing\" stuff.\n\nPro's:\n- Story. Really, after the garbage story from the previous FF game, this is a huge improvement. There is a long introduction to the story but I was engaged after it. The story creates a pretty intense motive up front and expands on it when you play.\n- Good graphics. It wasn't stunning but really good. I have really good equipment so that could vary.\n- (Subjective) - Story line - very guided. Not free roam. You are boxed in towards end game.\n\nCon's:\n-(Subjective) - Story line - very guided. Not free roam. For me after the last few games I played this was welcome to pretty much go on \"auto-pilot\". This could irritate some folks.\n- Game play. So this may be a semi-spoiler but the fighting...is ok. Not great. My biggest complaint is the shooting in effect to attack an enemy. FF15 let you transport in to the enemy and attack. This game, even with the enhancements that are at a cost - yeah, this is a joke. This is my biggest complaint - I shouldn't have to zoom in to the enemy multiple times.\n- Items/equipment: This is a joke. Equipped items make next to no difference...only incremental improvement. Really - they should have just assigned a sword, armor at the beginning, and as you level up so does the equipment. If you wanted to fly through the game - you can't buy and abundance of health, etc. I had to spend most of the game planning a return visit to a place I could \"buy\" health after each battle.\n\nSo this is my SPOILER section. Could be some spoiler stuff here. Please avoid as needed.\n\n- So...why can't we get an ending that isn't an attempt to get a tear jerk reaction from Square/Final Fantasy?\n- Summons? - non event. To me that is part of Final Fantasy. You only see summons when you go into a designated point in the story and then you hit X or R1 and it's basically a rehearsed battle along with the story line you really can't lose as you can restart when you die.",
                "6": "I haven’t liked a final fantasy game since X, most people haven’t (some people liked XII for some reason but the combat was awful). No this isn’t your traditional final fantasy gameplay, it’s more like the Witcher as an Action based RPG. But the characters and the story are incredible! It’s in an epic scale story with unexpected twists that rival any great RPG narrative. The active time lore is a fantastic addition. It lets brush up on characters, political situations, locations, and terminology as you progress through the game. The only complaint is that it’s a bit easy, but you can fix that with unequipping certain items that help you dodge or auto cure. If I’m doubt, try the demo from the PS store.",
                "7": "I went into FF16 with moderate expectations. I have been playing console games for 35+ years now, and I have seen everything. Every once in a while you come across a gem. The last one for me was Horizon Zero Dawn.\n\nHaving finished FF16 I can say that I am completely blown away....a Masterpiece for me.\n\nEpic story and plenty of eye candy visuals....and the boss fights.......holy cow!! If you have Sony's PS5 3D Headphones, it sounds amazing! Yes, there are tons of cut scenes, but the story itself is FANTASTIC.! A++\n\nMy only gripe is the Frame Rate. There is just something not right about it in certain situations, but I have no worries...it's by no means a show stopper and they will add a patch I'm sure. Aside from that, there are no other technical issues I have come across.\n\nGet it!",
                "8": "Final Fantasy XVI distinguishes itself from its predecessors in several ways. Unlike previous entries, it embraces a darker, more mature narrative tone, showcasing political intrigue and personal struggles. The real-time combat system offers a departure from the turn-based style of older titles, adding fluidity and excitement to battles.\n\nCharacter development and world-building remain strengths, with intriguing protagonists and a beautifully crafted game world. However, some fans might miss the classic Final Fantasy elements, such as turn-based combat and iconic summons.\n\nOverall, Final Fantasy XVI is a bold evolution of the series, combining new elements with the classic charm that has made the franchise iconic. It may not please every longtime fan, but it undoubtedly offers an exciting and fresh experience for RPG enthusiasts.",
                "9": "FF XVI is honestly an 7.5-8 out of 10. If not for the excellent story, characters and boss battles it would be a very poor game. But what it does well, it does incredibly well.\n\nI would categorize this game as an interactive TV series. There are a lot, and I mean a lot, of talking and plot building sequences. The ones with the NPC’s are forgettable. Side quests are also forgettable, go here, do this, maybe beat a few more of the same enemies, rinse and repeat.\n\nThis game is completely linear, you can move around a little, there is nothing to explore, it is essentially point A to point B. Other than mini-bosses and boss battles, the enemies are highly repetitive. You aren’t climbing, solving puzzles or doing much more than going A to B in anticipation of the next boss battle. The boss battles are incredible.\n\nThe art style, while beautiful, is relatively dull and textures are flat and lifeless. I think it was a style choice, but it is far, far from what you would see in Horizon Forbidden West. Sound design is excellent.\n\nThe good. The plot, the characters and the boss battles are excellent. I’ve continued playing out of interest in seeing the plot through, much like reading a good book.\n\nThe bad. Zero replayability, unless you are someone that rereads the same books over and over. I would have greatly preferred a different art design. Better use of environments. Shorter NPC talking sequences. More detail to make environments look more alive, very barebones. More RPG elements would be welcome.",
                "10": "Story - very political like FF12 but spans nearly two decades through whole game. In terms of characterization, character logic and magic lore its lacking poorly. Only the main character feels fully fleshed out, most of other characters no where nearly as much besides maybe the stable Cid character. If you wanna explore the side characters, then optional side quests it is. There are main story parts when fighting against a summon boss but half the fights end up being a long cutscene to do some QTEs, pretty to look at but boring gameplay wise. These fights destroy nearly everything around them yet afterwards main characters allies come into view totally unscathed, its like...where did they hide from all this destruction during lol. Overall, its far too cutscene heavy taking control away from the player every few moments.\n\nCombat-\nIt literally is like Devil May Cry but with a much easier entry point. Loads of attack animations are so similar to DMC5. This because FF16 combat director was also DMC games' combat director when they use to work for Capcom. This battle system has loads of synergy depth even within the main character's regular sword combos before unlocking more summon attacks later via skill menu from skill points given after battles, can even fully respec at anytime no cost. If you aren't good at action combat, you can use these accessories that auto-play to a certain degree for you, auto-dodge, auto-combo, auto-heal etc. Stagger meter returns from past FF games, some attacks do more stagger bar dmg than HP dmg, once stagger bar is gone the enemy takes a knee. Dealing dmg in this state increase your dmg during all the way up to x1.50. You also have Limit Break meter unlocked that gives main character buffs of attack speed, damage output and auto-regen while active, cant die in this form either. Unlike past FF games, only control main character 99% of time, and one other character for plot reasons certain parts of the game. All party members are automated, cant play as them, nor level them, or mirco manage their equipment or skill trees, nothing. I forgot they were there half the time honestly. Combat wise they're mostly just flashy chip damage.\n\nExploration -\nit is very linear broken up between 4 sandbox zones belong to each nation which has tiny villages, towns through out which all feel lived in NPCs about chatting doing varity of things. No exploring actual full cities, unless its main story dungeon for plot reasons with pathways blocked off with destruction around. For these you defeat mob of enemies, run a linear path, do interaction with something to advance and repeat it gets old very fast.\n\nSide quests -\nthe pacing for showing them is very good, gives you about less than 5 at a time every few main story beats so you dont feel overwhelmed with quest markers everywhere (until final main story, then quest markers like crazy). But gameplay wise its very dated like mmorpgs (makes sense, FF16 devs are also the FF14 MMO devs) yet narratively they are very well written and flesh out the world's lore, side character backstories galore. Even after doing some quests if will show NPCs around affected by that completed quest, even doing some quests before others will add more to different quests entirely. I have done every single side quest and FF12-like Rank hunt side bosses and loved them all. If not your thing, be sure to do plus symbol side quests at least, they'll unlock a mount, more healling item usages etc.\n\nMusic-\nLead Composer is Soken, same as FF14 main composer. So you'd think incredible OST for FF16 if you're a FF14 fan. Honestly, massive hot take but barely remembered any of FF16 music, besides remix prelude on the way to final boss lair, and maybe one soundtrack during later phase of a summon boss fight which irony sounded like DMC music. But that was it, such a blurr for me music wise I am sorry fellow Soken fans.\n\nRole Playing mechanics or lack there of-\nAs review title stated, this game is not an RPG. main character equips a sword for their primary damage which just gives \"attack\" and \"stagger\" stat points, majority of the time both being the same number. A belt and a bangle, with 3 accessories slots. The belt and bangle barely increase anything but +5 or less points just \"defense\" stat and maybe under 5 to 10 to your max HP which is in the thousands, so worthless. It all feels so tacked on, cuz Final Fantasy is RPG franchise they did bare minium stats. This is 1st mainline game with no debuffs at all ( enemy malboro bad breath just damages you thats it) and no elemental weaknesses or resistances. So like doing thunder attacks on a coerul it doesnt heal it like past FF games, it all feels so weird for an supposed RPG. Then crafting is often useless, 90% of the time. You will only need it to upgrade your sword few times and for NG+ on a harder difficult to get the Utima Weapon via crafting and that is only unlocked after beating your 1st playthrough.\n\nSummary-\nOverall I kinda regret getting the game tbh.\nTruly only incredible voice acting performance of Ben Starr (voice of main character) and the side quests, side characters helped me through this game. But disjointed poorly paced story, magic lore, flawed character logic, and not being an RPG made this game very middling for me. I would recommend to DMC fans, and those that dont like RPG mechanics but wanna try final fantasy cuz this is definitely it."

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "I don't understand why people complain about the bugs and glitches in this game. I've only encountered one so far in my journey through Paldea, and that was a sky rendering issue before the dark star badge. But even then, it lasted less than a second and didn't make a difference in the gameplay. This is a great Pokemon game if you want to get into the franchise and I'm getting the DLC soon, so that will add on more content when I beat the game. Only Pokemon Black and White on the DS can beat this game in creativity, originality, and new features.",
                "2": "The game runs a bit laggy at times even with the small patch they released. But otherwise, graphics are what you’d expect and more from Nintendo based games. The game is open world and you start with character creation and naming your character, then you jump into the game where you are introduced to the professor. Everything else more or less follows the trailer with the exception of…..you actually get to experience Paldea and not just view the short clips from that trailer 😂 overall it is a fun and exciting game. 1 tip for players: get your first 3 gym badges and 3 titan badges as SOON as possible. It’ll make your life easier in the game, trust me.",
                "3": "Yes, the critics say the graphics are bad, and they are. They say that it's not on par with other 5+ year old sandbox games, and that's true... But it's the deepest strategical Pokemon game to date and the Paldean Pokedex is fantastic. Just buy it and throw a few 100 hours in. You know you want to...",
                "4": "I love the characters and music in this game. The graphics are good and I love the open world experience. I also love the story as it has a storyline but also allows me to feel as if I'm creating my own story as I go. As I am still new to Pokémon games I also really enjoy taking classes at the school to learn to play the game better and about Pokémon in general. It's definitely a helpful and unique way to get the most out of playing the game.",
                "5": "Pros:\n- Exploring the world (particularly jumping off the many waterfalls)\n- The world is open and you can choose where you want to go and what you want to do in what order\n- The Pokémon (of course) including many new ones (especially seeing them walking around as you explore and battle)\n- New Terastallization feature functions great and looks great too by crystallizing Pokémon and giving them type crowns\n- Really good story (there are multiple storylines that are all well executed, enjoyable, and have good moral lessons)\n- Not having to go to a Pokémon Center to access your storage boxes like in previous games so you can use different team combinations more easily\n- You can swap your Pokémon’s moves for any previously learned moves anytime outside of battle in your general menu\n- Once you log a Pokémon in your Pokédex, when you battle it again each of your team Pokémon moves will show how effective they are by type during while attacking, while switching between Pokémon, and the differences while Terastallized.\n- Being able to fast travel to many points once discovered to avoid backtracking (Pokémon Centers, towers, shrines, etc.)\n- Fast travel is available early for free\n- Having a storyline-based Pokémon that does actions like moving on water instead of having to use valuable Pokémon move slots\n- Unlimited TM crafting\n- Easy to find items running around since they glow\n- Easy not to run out of money because you can find a lot of items by just running around\n- You can engage in traditional battles or have your Pokémon walk with you and battle/find items quickly\n- All Pokémon in your party gain experience from battles even if they don’t participate so it’s easier to grow\n- Weather and day/night changes\n- You can still do raids solo because NPCs join you\n- Customizations for hair, eyes, face, socks, shoes, gloves, hats, etc. (although unfortunately you cannot change the eyebrows with the hair together because the latter is a shop and the former is separate in your outfit menu)\n- Yay good cutscenes\n- Larry! And Penny! (I honestly can’t recall ever liking Pokémon video game characters as much…great character development and dialogue)\n- The ending is 100% awesome\n\nCons:\n- Lack of game balancing and scaling in difficulty levels (they didn’t get it to work well with the open world in time for release and I’d recommend having backup Pokémon to switch to if you become too overpowered for an area and it becomes too easy…not even referencing the challenger who was about level 14 outside the Elite Four)\n- Long load times (particularly at the school - school mechanics can be done really well in games like Persona/Fire Emblem and improve the games, but that didn’t seem to be the case here)\n- Far, far, far too many tests/quizzes (school, gyms, Elite Four, etc.) and I honestly didn’t like any of them even though I passed them\n- Sometimes the environments are repetitive and buggy (nothing like seeing the same color tree/rock for the 1000th time, the tunnel/cliff you’re by suddenly going to a blue screen, or seeing a poor Pokémon half in a wall…I don’t mind simpler graphics, but a lot felt reused and not as aesthetically pleasing as other titles)\n- Repetitive NPCs with bad designs particularly for battle challengers (at this point I’m convinced more elderly lookalikes attend the school than children, women can only be buff hikers or models obsessed with eyeshadow, and others…there were too few same-age students out in the world like they were supposed to be per the story but those that were there were well done with varying personalities so there should have been more of that but instead the ratios were way off)\n- Too many annoying characters with cliché and overly long dialogue (not those like Larry and Penny who were amazing, but others like some teachers and gym leaders made me just want to get it over with and get back out to exploring…bad characters seemed worse since some characters are just really well done so you knew the developers/writers could do better)\n- Lack of interactivity in cities and indoors (for example, you cannot go into buildings that lack doormats, and you cannot interact with random items as much as previous games)\n- The map can be unclear on path accessibility/elevation which makes it harder to use earlier in the game before you can climb\n- You are forced to keep wearing ugly school uniforms (shops have sections for tops/bottoms but never sell any, and items in shop windows are often never for sale)\n- First 2/3 of Area Zero felt repetitive and was a letdown\n- You select your language for the game but they still use other languages outside the language classroom which can be confusing for people who aren’t good at that\n- Lack of voiceovers for character dialogue\n- Shiny Pokémon are easy to miss\n- Game controls need improvements (lag when moving, lack of accuracy when targeting wild Pokémon to throw balls or attack, sometimes you start sliding/freeze while climbing for no reason, or you dive/drop while gliding which made me miss the better flying sightseeing in Arceus)\n\nThis is a game that has a great foundation but severely lacked fine-tuning. I’ve played the games since the original red and blue, and I am happy I bought the game. I enjoyed it to the point that I finished the storylines to the credits relatively quickly after launch. However, it seemed like they ran out of time to finish the game (perhaps didn’t want to push the release date and miss Christmas sales). While I just ignored the glitches/laughed at them and enjoyed the game despite them, considering how big the Pokémon franchise is, they should have the budget to make polished games so it’s kind of inexcusable that they are selling an unfinished product. They’ve already released a patch but there are still issues. Maybe (hopefully) they’ll do more patches and this review will become outdated. It’s sad to see something with so many good qualities not reach it’s full potential, but I would still recommend the game because the good it does have makes it truly worth it.",
                "6": "Came a little late for being a preorder, but it was fun to play",
                "7": "What I really like about this game is the fact that you are not stuck following 1 road. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the world and discovering new places and pokemons. I am not a pokemon fanatic, but Violet is definitely more fun than Shield. And because you are free to explore and do \"side\" stories, this game takes me a while for me to finish. Unlike shield, I finish that game in a week because of the linear progression, and I hated it. Violet, I can sit, enjoy, and take my time to finish the game. Truly enjoyed it! :)",
                "8": "For a Gift yet given",
                "9": "It looks like a Pokemon game. It feels like a Pokemon game. It plays like a Pokemon game. If I want graphics from Xenoblade 2, I'll play Xenoblade 2, not Pokemon. Sure, you can say the textures aren't great, but they aren't _intrusive_. It's hard enough to see some of the tinier Pokemon on the overworld, and I could only imagine that being 2-3x worse with more plentiful grass/better textures, etc. For the style of the game, the graphics they chose makes _sense_, but if graphics make or break a game for you, then I suppose you should skip this installment (and all Pokemon games, probably).\n\nIn terms of the bugs...yes, the game is buggy, mostly is rendering distance for animated people. Some of the cutscenes were so badly animated I laughed (it was worst in the opening tutorial, then got better as I played). But when push came to shove and you needed to get somewhere or talk to someone, I never had any issues. None of the \"bugs\" were game breaking, and honestly I cared more about exploring the overworld than I did the cities, so the glitchy textures didn't bother me all too much.\n\nNow I would love to gush about all of the things I LOVED about this game. The open world experience was so utterly free, that I actually lost my first gym battle because I was exploring and found some out of the intended order. Sure, going back to the easier gyms meant that the fights were cake by comparison, but this is the level of freedom the game offered. You had 3 completely separate storylines to pursue, and I was actually invested in all of them. You have to complete all 3 to unlock the final area, which tied up a lot of loose ends and provided a satisfying ending.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect was really interesting and fun to play around with! We couldn't fight NPCs together on the overworld (though we didn't try too hard to figure it out), but we could explore together, actually watch the overworld Pokemon battles the other did and keep tabs on what the other player was catching/battling.\n\nTerastalizing was a cool new gimmick, though I didn't find myself using it too often. The different typings were usually pretty straightforward to differentiate, and made for some fun mistakes when you used a move to wipe out one type, but it terastalized to another so your move did nothing or less than you meant to. Tera raid battles seemed easier than Sword/Shield, but I hear they go up to level 7, and we've only challenged level 4s.\n\nI loved my rival, who is actually already a Pokemon champion, so in every \"rival battle\" she's testing you instead of just trying to beat you, which was incredibly refreshing. Instead of being upset, she is just so infectiously excited by your progress that I looked forward to our next interaction.\n\nI loved the school classes I could take, which were still entertaining, fun, and gave you rewards for working through them. As someone who's been playing Pokemon since Red/Blue, most of the classes didn't have anything TOO challenging, but there were a few things even I struggled with on the tests. The school also offered an \"affection\" system with the teachers, which would net you some nice items by the end if you stick it out. It is obviously very different from normal Pokemon gameplay, and helped to breakup some of the monotony around \"battle/catch/explore\" of the rest of the game.\n\nThe world is truly open, unlike Arceus which felt like a bit of a trial run for Scarlet/Violet. The game rewards you for exploring with various items, TMs, and rare Pokemon that only spawn in certain areas. The auto battle system felt pretty broken when I first heard about it, but as you progress farther into the game, the experience you get from overworld battles is fairly minimal, and you'd still have to spend an adequate amount of time grinding if you wanted to be truly overleveled for the content. Maybe that feels \"too easy\" for veteran players of the series, but I'm too old now to find joy in engaging in battle after battle of wild Pokemon for pitiful amounts of experience, and I appreciated the streamlined process.\n\nI truly loved my legendary, and having it available for you early in the game and the thing that facilitates your movement and exploration of the world was a different but great choice. By the time you get to the final battle, where of course you'd be using it in battle, I was very invested in this silly little creature, and the emotional beats actually had some payoff.\n\nAs a last note, I'll say I loved this generations designs; probably the best ones I've seen in quite a few titles. Sure, there are some uninspired ones (looking at you, Flamigo the flamingo), but even Red/Blue had some uninspired designs (Grimer is literally some sentient grime, and Exeggcute is literally just a pile of eggs). All of the designs felt like actual Pokemon to me, and the graphics didn't seem out of place when put next to earlier gens (unlike the adorable Yamper from Sword/Shield as an example).\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a great new addition to the franchise. If low textures or slightly buggy graphics infuriates you, maybe skip it or wait for some patches, but the game is quite playable, has charming stories and fun gameplay. For folks that say it's too easy, might I recommend trying a challenge run, such as \"new pokemon only\" or \"single type only\" to challenge you a little more.",
                "10": "I’m conflicted. Pokémon Violet is one of those games that would be so much better if they changed one thing. Even though it’s something that doesn’t directly affect the gameplay. Even if all the other mechanics in the game are fun. Sure, I got used to it, but that doesn’t mean I have to be happy about it. Perhaps they should have delayed the game instead of adhering to a strict release schedule. After all, other games have done well by delaying to add that extra layer of polish. Unfortunately, I don’t think anything’s going to change.\n\nVisually, Pokémon Violet is a tough pill to swallow. All the Pokémon models look fantastic, which just makes the look of the rest of the game a disappointment. I don’t think it would have mattered if I experienced more of the game in long shots, but the number of close-up focus moments that show jagged jpeg-artifact textures were too many to ignore. Even though the visuals don’t directly affect the gameplay, they’re frustrating to see. Other games on the same hardware look a lot better, so it’s not necessarily the limitations of the Switch hardware. If only they provided a patch with high-resolution textures, then I’d rate this game much higher.\n\nAside from this visual gripe, I loved a lot of what Pokémon Violet had to offer. The open-world format was something that was long overdue—including being able to see all the nearby Pokémon and decide whether I wanted to fight them. The story (all three parts of it) was superb. All the music was catchy and probably some of the best in the franchise. There were a lot of changes to the standard Pokémon formula in this game, and I think most of them worked flawlessly in advancing the franchise.\n\nA fantastic entry in the Pokémon franchise that suffers from a lack of visual polish, I give Pokémon Violet 3.5 stars out of 5."

                "1": "I've only just recently started playing racing games again. I have been gaming for over 35 years and played racing games back to one called Indy 500. I was trying to play the new game with a keyboard and then an old game controller I had laying around but it was frustrating. I was driving off road more than on. My son suggested getting a steering wheel and so I did. HUGE difference! I am on the road almost all of the time now! LOL. Now it has more to do with speed and braking. I'm getting it.\nThis wheel and pedal pad are very solid and responsive. The pedals have a very solid spring and are not mushy at all.\nThe price for this wheel and the overall quality definitely give you bang for the buck. I have not tried any high priced gaming wheel systems, but if this one is doing this much for me, I'm not sure I need one. However, if a high priced gaming wheel manufacturer wants me to test one to see the difference, bring it on! LOL!",

                "4": " I’ve had this wheel for a few weeks now, and I have some things to say.\n\nPros:\n-Having no force feedback, the wheel is easy to use and is great for beginners.\n-Since the wheel automatically goes to the center, it can slide through your hands when you’re turning all the way to the left or right if you’re looking for that feature.\n-Despite the materials, the wheel and pedals feel pretty dang good for the price.\n-Easy to use and setup, price is cheap.\n-The profile feature is awesome and convenient.\n-The wheel is a little smaller than a regular car steering wheel, but still comfortable.\n-I haven’t stopped playing with the wheel since I bought it.\n\nCons:\n-Coming back to the automatically centering thing, you can feel a weird tactile bump thingy that happens when you pass the middle. But when you’re driving, you don’t feel it much.\n-Obviously it can only turn 270° it does feel a bit weird because you want to turn it more than that.\n-Pedals feel small. Pedal shifters are loose and loud.\n-Materials are cheap plastic, the steering wheel feels hollow but I’m not sure.\n-This happens rarely, but sometimes you have to unplug and replug the steering wheel for it to work.\n-These cons are pretty small and don’t take away from the fun.\n\nOverall, this is a great wheel and I’ve been having a blast with it so far. If you’re looking for a first wheel, I highly recommend this one.",
                "5": "I have had this for a few days and, I will say, It’s great! However, there are a few things that are slightly annoying.\n\n1. The paddle shifters are very very lightweight, which causes it to feel like they will break with any press, and it clicks VERY loudly.\n\n2. The pedals Are very close together and relatively small, so it makes playing with shoes on kind of difficult.\n\n3. The wheel itself is a little small, and it only has a 270° rotation, which makes playing hand over hand difficult or impossible.\n\nBut overall, its a very good beginner wheel!",
                "6": "Seems todo everything right, had set it up and notice the Xbox light don’t light up, but everything else seems to work well. Easy to adjust the wheel",
                "7": "Good starter. not really good with forza 5 unless doing drag races",
                "8": "If you’re looking for a realistic feeling controller this isn’t the one for you, it’s better suited for casual gamers who just got into racing sims or just want to drive around open world games",
                "9": "To work with Windows 11 just switch the selector on top of the wheel to the 2 position. No drivers need to be loaded.",
                "10": "I race on my xbox super commonly, so I finally decided it was time for me to get wheel. I went with this, as it is budget, while also being good and versatile. I was wrong. Straight off the bat, the pedals are trash. The underside of them have no grip, so anytime you press down on the pedals, the entire thing moves, and speaking of trash pedals, the brake kept turning on and off as if it had a mind of its own! One corner it was great, next corner, brake failure. This kept happening til the brake pedal just died. It just stopped working. And it is not like I used this for a while, I had played with the setup for an hour, and this stuff was already happening. The wheel is ok. It is sleek and cool looking for the price, but then again, it doesn't have vibration, force feedback, or even a headset port. and the sensitivity is just straight up terrible. I really wish I could have said something positive about this. I was REALLY looking forward to it. But trash will always be trash. I don't even know how Microsoft certified this. They probably just looked at it for half a second and gave them a sticker. If you want to get better at video game racing, just get a Logitech or something like that. it might be 2-3x the price, but this poop stopped working after like an hour. I am certainly going to return it, and give it another shot, but I will warn you, this is a budget wheel. This has a super high chance of just randomly stop working. Extremely disappointing, I want my money back.",
                "11": "Great for the money",
                "12": "This is a good wheel for the price. Lots of options for controller layout. Has all of your Xbox buttons on the wheel so if your playing games like F1 that requires you to make adjustments to brake diff or communicate with the pit, you can.\n\nDown side, it's very light in terms of materials and feel. The paddles are super light weight with little resistance. Thin plastic.\n\nOverall, what I'd expect for the price. If you're serious about your racing games, splash the cash for a higher end wheel that will give you a more realistic feel. If you're just hopping on a racing game here and there, it fills the role."

                "1": "Let me first start out by saying I am a casual gamer. I've been playing Xbox One for the last few years and decided to get this head set for that particular gaming system. This is a great gaming headset! I upgraded from my Turtle Beach headset that served me very well for many years. Here is what I liked and did not like about the Astro A50.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat sound: Customizable pre-sets and default presets make this headset ideal for those that want to tweak their headset settings. You can easily adjust settings on this headset by using the free Astro app on any Windows PC or Apple OS computer. You can also select one of three headsets loaded on the headset by simply pushing the preset button. This cycles through three presets on the headset (1-3).\n\nGreat feel: This headset is lightweight. You can easily wear this for 8+ hours during those long gaming sessions and still not get fatigued by wearing it. While the headset is lightweight it is still built very very well and feel solid. You won't feel like you can easily break this headset which for the price point is a good thing. The headset also does not pinch or make my head uncomfortable in anyway and if measured out I have a large head.\n\nWireless: The headset is 100% wireless. The only time you will need to have the headset docked is for charging. There is no cables to get in the way between you and the gaming controller or the gaming console. The freedom is nice. With the wireless capabilities also comes outstanding range. When wearing the headset I can literally go to any area of my apartment and still hear voice and game sounds. It's also nice not being tethered to your controller or console. If you've never experience true wireless gaming this will be mind blowing for you--it was for me.\n\nMic: While some reviews have posted complaints about the mic quality I have had really no issues with the mic. I am careful with it and raise and lower it with ease as to not damage the mechanism. The mic is turned on and off by raising and lowering. Up is in the off/mute position and down is in the on/voice position. No complaints from anyone in my gaming party on not being able to hear me either. You may need to carefully bend the end of the mic inward to your face a bit for best results. Keep in mind that if you do this the mic will hit the headset in the off/mute position so be careful not to damage it. While it would be nice to have a switch to tap to turn the mic on or off it is also nice to have the mic up out of the way for those solo gaming sessions or if you don't feel like being social during a particular gaming session.\n\nCons:\n\nAdjusting in game and voice chat volume: While there is a \"rocker switch\" to adjust game and voice chat sound it is often confusing and I find myself constantly looking to see which way I should push the switch to adjust either the game volume or voice chat volume. This is especially true if I don't use the headset for several weeks between gaming sessions. Again, I am a casual gamer so this is my experience. Opinions on this will vary!\n\nOverall volume: It is nice to be able to easily raise or lower overall sound volume. This is game volume and voice chat volume. The downside to the particular way this headset's volume control works is that it's on a round dial. This dial is too easily manipulated especially if you are resting in a reclined position. I find myself inadvertently lowering the volume in the middle of a gaming session and then I need to remove one hand from the gaming controller to re-adjust the volume control. This is a drawback to the design but not a deal breaker. If you never game in a reclined position you very well may never experience an issue with this!\n\nOverall this is light years ahead of any basic headset and even more advanced in many ways over the competitors top end headset models. If you are a serious or casual gamer this is a headset that you should check-out and you'll probably realize that this is the route to go.\n\nThanks for reading!",
                "2": "The headset works extremely well with my Xbox series s. It connects smoothly every time and I have not had one issue with the connection. The battery life is the best I’ve experienced. Also these are really comfortable. I will have them on for hours at a time and won’t feel any discomfort. Great product and would recommend to anyone.",
                "3": "Bought this headset June 22nd, 2021. Within a month or so, I started noticing that it would make clicking and staticky noises (harsh enough to feel like it's damaging my hearing) here and there, seemingly randomly, and would occasionally cut out the audio altogether, anywhere from a split second to me having to reset my bas station manually. Because I'm such a good customer, I tried finding solutions online before contacting ASTRO, because I thought for sure the issue was on my end and I could fix it. But nothing worked.\n\nSo I contacted ASTRO for help in early August, and they gave me a list of options to try. I spent many hours over two or three weeks testing and trying to fix the issue, but none of them worked. I read the manufacturer warranty and, from what I remember, it said I could get it repaired, replaced, or refunded within a year for faulty parts or whatever.\n\nSo in late August I contacted them again to tell them nothing worked and I'm having the same issues, and requested a replacement. Instead of fulfilling my request, they simply gave me more options to try and fix it, but after so many hours of testing, I told them I was not interested in testing it further, since I had zero confidence anything would work. Instead of replacing everything, they sent a new base station.\n\nTook 1-2 weeks for the base station to arrive in the mail, which I received somewhere in mid September. Tested it a bunch, just like before, didn't make any difference. Contacted them back once again on October 1st to finally just replace the headset itself, as I was certain at this point it was an issue with the headset, especially since I read some reviews and questions on Amazon that mentioned the same issues I'm having. Luckily they complied right away and started the process of returning my headset and shipping a new one, but as expected I had to send mine in first.\n\nTook about three weeks to finally get the replacement headset in late October after extensive shipping delays. Tested it out a bit, no change. Still making all the same obnoxious, harmful noises the previous headset did. By now, I've realized the clicks and the static aren't as random as I thought, and seem to happen when certain sounds are played. It's hard to explain, but basically it can happen in any game I play or YouTube video I watch, but certain sounds trigger it more often. For instance, it happens frequently when playing Battlefield 1 multiplayer, but not as much in Jurassic World: Evolution; it's consistently worse in BF1, but still unbearable when it happens in JW:E. This only cemented my belief that the headset is faulty.\n\nAt this point I just decided it wasn't worth it anymore and I'd just get a refund for it, and maybe switch to wired headsets to avoid wireless issues. Got a response pretty quick telling me they don't do refunds past 30 days, but I can totally just send them back my $300 headset without a refund. No mention whether they would replace it again or anything, just \"feel free to send it back\", as if I would just \"donate\" my faulty $300 headset back to them for nothing in return.\n\nNever had these issues with the Turtle Beach headset I used for the 5 years prior. Only with the ASTRO A50 headset. They look and feel premium, but in practice they sound cheap as dirt. Now I seriously regret my decision to buy from ASTRO, let alone not returning it for a full refund immediately once I started having issues. Never buying from ASTRO ever again.",
                "4": "I've had an Astro a40 wired gaming headset for years so I was already familiar with the brand. $300 is a lot to spend on something so do your research and read the reviews both positive and negative. My personal experience is 100% positive.\n\nI wanted them solely for my PC since the a40's are in a different area of the room hooked up to the Xbox/Playstation/TV and having to unhook and reconnect every time I want to use the headphones is a hassle. Setting the a50's up to the PC took less than 30 seconds. Seriously. I simply connected the micro-usb to the base, connected the USB end to a free slot on my PC tower, turned the headphones on and viola! Windows 10 recognized the plug and play of a set of headphones and I was up and going in less than a minute. (Granted I made sure the toggle on the base was set to \"PC\" before I plugged everything in and turned it on)\n\nSound quality is excellent. Just what I expected from a set of $300 astro gaming headphones. If you want to say anything on the mic, you just swing the arm down and it unmutes. Swing it back if you want to mute. Easy. Now, they are a wee bit tight when you first put them on but give it a good session of gaming and you'll be fine. You can adjust the volume by either using the dial on the right side of the headset or simply changing the volume via your PC controls.\n\nBattery life is advertised at being 15 hours of life before it needs a charge. I was able to use it for a few hours right out of the box. The charging base tells you how much battery life you have left via the 4 lighted squares on the base (see pic). I haven't used up all the juice yet and it has seemed to hold up nicely. The charging is super easy. The headset will sit on the base and if charging is initiated the squares will light up and indicate how much charge the battery has by how many lights are shown. Just charge them after you get done using them (like you would with your phone) and you'll be ready to go the next time you want to use them.\n\nSome additional features include: the cloth ear cups are removeable if you want to clean them or purchase the mod kit that has leather ear cups. Astro provides a free 2 year license of Dolby Atmos for headphones which is useful for all of those Call of Duty players.\n\nRange is VERY nice. With other wireless headsets you have a range at which you can walk away from the receiver before you lose the signal. I was able to walk three rooms away and go outside before I started to notice signal loss. That is about 50' (15m) through walls and around corners. *Just make sure you mute before you go to the bathroom*\n\n$300 is a lot to throw down for a nice pair of headphones. But these are worth the price.",
                "5": "This is a great headset with two cons: 1) Incredibly uncomfortable. Purchased a $15 leather headset pad that did the trick, but that shouldn't be necessary when paying $300 for a headset. 2) Overpriced. $220 would be fair. However, I'm alright paying $300 due to the performance increase over headsets in the $120 range. As for pros: pretty much everything else. Sound quality is very good, mic is very good, and charging base is unnecessary but rather cool and very good. You can charge while playing which is good, flip mic to silence which is good as well, and if you last them down they turn off, and then turn back on when picked up. Overall they're worth it if you have the money to spend. If you're unsure of spending that much and would rather go with something in the $100 range: grab a pair of Corsairs. Not as high of quality, but better bang for your buck.",
                "6": "As you can tell from the title I wear glasses while gaming and they can cause some discomfort during longer gaming sessions with certain headphones. Not the case with these, I was surprised how well they accommodate them. Do I feel the pressure eventually, yes. But this isn't until many hours in and it is only slight. Besides that the audio quality is excellent, the software for audio adjustment is fairly user friendly, and the various buttons/settings on the headset are very useful.\n\nMy only drawbacks are slight, but to be thorough: the base/dock for charging can be a bit finnicky when it comes to lining up the pins correctly between the headset and the base. Also the aesthetics are not exactly my taste, but I don't stream so I don't care at all what it looks like on my head as long as it's comfortable and functional.\n\nIn short, it's definitely a bit pricey but in my opinion you get everything you are paying for.",
                "7": "(I'm using these for PC.) first things first, out of the box. These headphones sound TERRIBLE! but worry not! download the astro command center app (the reviews for the app are all 1 star for some reason. but I had no issues with it.) then download the dolby access app. Use both of these apps to adjust all levels. There are some video's online you can use as a reference for the best settings. ALSO! keep in mind these headphones have 2 overall settings. Voice and game. Which you can adjust on the fly by the big side buttons on the right earcup. Setting it more toward voice will make voices crystal clear but will LOWER the game volume and over levels. On the flip side, set it to game to get the best out of your gaming sound. Once you have it set up right. These headphones sound AMAZING. They are super lightweight. Super comfortable. And disappear on your head. I'm moving from Audio-Technica ath-m50x over to these. And these sound better. If that gives you any idea how good it is.",
                "8": "Let me start with I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES! That may sound contradictory to the header but, there are a few issues that took literal months for me to solve that make these headphones not worth the stress at this price point.\n\nTrying to update the drivers on these headphones to make them compatible with consoles is a chore, they aren't ready to play for consoles out of the box without a PC [Which I have and use them on] They only work for PC. The software itself for updating the drivers doesn't work. At least the Microsoft store version which is the version that downloads from most links they give you. THEIR version of the software does work but requires searching for the drivers manually and installing them manually.\n\nAnd finally, the top cushion that rests on the top of the user's head constantly popped off for me, to the point where now I have fastened it in place with electrical tape, it's still comfortable but I shouldn't have to tape a $300 headset out of the box.\n\nTL;DR: This headset is not worth this price for the out-of-box maintenance go get something newer from this company or a different company entirely.",
                "9": "Love the headset itself, very comfortable even with glasses on. My only complaint is the little head cushion piece did pop out and won't stay when I try to pop it back in. I've had these for about a week. For a $300 headset, you'd think they would address this issue. I've seen many other reviews stating the same thing. I superglued it into place and have had no further issues with it. It doesn't bother me because it's an easy fix. But for a $300 headset, I think the build quality could be improved.",
                "10": "The sound quality and noise cancelation is fantastic. I use this almost daily and the mic does not pic up any ambient noise and is great. I use this for games where sound is significant.\n\nThe battery has a long life and the docking station is great and easy to use.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say is I wish the game sound and voice sound is toggle to switch. This limits the options of changing the balance on the fly. You can still adjust in settings."

                "1": "My review is for the PlayStation 5 version of this game. As a child, the Robocop theme song was always playing through my head—as I played, as I created—as I did anything I loved. When I saw this game was coming out, I instantly preordered. I have a huge collection of Robocop memorabilia and I still believe it is one of the greatest action films to come out of the 80s—and still one of the greatest of all time. So, take that with a grain of salt. Some of my friends were sure this was going to be a buggy mess—I am happy to say that Alex Murphy returns to cleanse the streets and not a day has passed to wash away this nuke-filled 80s Detroit. We have Peter Weller reprising his role. We have a love for the source material on full display from the developers. And when I was let into the building to begin mowing down thugs at the beginning of the game that old rousing score had a permanent smile on my face until the conclusion of the mission. I have to say, the developers got this right! Now, there are some bugs and some rough edges. I had to restart a mission because my gun site got fastened to my visor at one point. The cutscene characters kind of pop in on PS5–maybe a patch could fix—every NPC punk yells about how you destroyed their hand, and sometimes you can literally launch a biker into space with a robopunch—but this stuff is great. The environmental destruction is a nice touch. The M9 rocks as you would expect, and although Robo is slow, it helps sell the narrative that you are an unstoppable tank. Try not to smile when you marry a punk’s skull with a computer monitor. As a child of the 80s, I have been starved for something that does Robocop justice, and this game has finally given us a sequel to wash the remake and Robocop 3 away. I hope this team sticks with 80s properties or more Robocop! While it is not technical perfection, it is trying to do something that shooters don’t attempt these days. Did I mention Robocop has dialogue options? As a kid I always wanted him to realize his humanity and now I get to do that too! Happy and surprised by this new 80s action dream come true!",
                "2": "As a die hard fan of the original Robocop film from 1987, i am very impressed with this game. Peter Weller (the original robocop actor from parts 1 and 2) returns to provide the voice. Overall the story had a lot of depth to it. Gameplay was fun. Decisions you make as robocop can affect the outcome of events. It captures the spirit of the movie with the bloody violence, social satire and all other elements of the 1987 original",
                "3": "I feel like these games only come along once or twice in a decade. Be it Predator: Concrete Jungle, Ghostbusters, Alien: Isolation and now RoboCop: Rogue City there are these instances of games that are made with such a slavish focus on details of the original source material while also serving as a continuation to the story as a sequel would that for a fan of that franchise of films you can feel well and truly satisfied with the production. These types of projects are rare and they only happen once and there are never sequels so with this new RoboCop game I really took my time and savored all the wonderful fan service the devs decided to put into it.\n\nStory wise this game takes place between the films RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3 and they spin a pretty interesting yarn it also explains a few plot holes that the third film had. It definitely had more walking and talking sections than I would have expected from a RoboCop game which didn’t end up being a negative for me.\n\nGameplay is pretty standard old school shooter stuff, it’s basically a mix of the newer Doom games and the original Crysis. I don’t mean to sell it short with that description but how else can you describe being a walking tank with a pistol that absolutely shreds enemies. There is even a mod you can get later into the game that adds even more gore to your shooting, definitely not a game for the squeamish about blood and guts and dismemberment. There are a host of other firearms you can use but I was just having too much fun with the iconic RoboCop gun to really use any of them.\n\nIt’s got a solid campaign that lasted for around 15 hours and I really took my time and explored everything I could and still found that I missed some things. As of this writing there is no NG+ option and it has a couple of DLCs that only offer cosmetic changes to RoboCop and his pistols appearances.\n\nMy copy was for the PS5 and I have to warn anyone that at the time of this writing the game is quite buggy on PS5. I experience everything from audio glitches, textures not loading correctly, NPC facial animations not syncing with their dialogue, one colossal instance of frame rate drop, and at one point the game even loaded a completely different level than it was supposed to and left me wandering around thinking it was part of the narrative for a half an hour before I just restarted the game. I know it sounds like a lot but it was over the course of 15 hours and once I learned to just restart the game at the first sign of trouble I didn’t really have an issue afterwards. Hopefully they get it patched and working properly before my second play through.",
                "4": "AAA studios could learn from this comparably small developer! This is the first RoboCop game I have played that is any fun and it is a lot of fun!",
                "5": "El videojuego está genial, es como estar dentro de las películas originales, superó mis expectativas como fan de Robocop. Vale mucho la pena.\n\nLa gran frustración se fundamenta en que hice la pre orden y no recibí el contenido descargable DLC que Amazon anunciaba.

From NPC animations resetting at sporadic times, to cut scenes chopping up, aiming not occurring or being delayed when pulled L2, to even the audio clicking and popping. Clipping controls are janky; nothing more frustrating then moving in slow motion and you're not able to get out of the way of a grenade because there's a pizza box on the floor (I wish I was joking).\n\nPeter Weller is great in this, some of the environment design is highly detailed, and I'm sure there is plenty of deep lore in this game. But the cut-rate voice acting coupled with character animations that look like they belong on an XBox 360 really pulls me out of the game. I'm not even sure I'll be able to finish it because it's genuinely that frustrating.",

                "1": "It took me a long time to select headphones for XBOX gaming & on-line webinars with the added bonus of bluetooth connectivity to my cellphone. I did a tremendous amount of research which is really difficult because the majority of manufacturers website descriptions are geared towards teenagers - all glitter and noise with meaningless videos. Maybe I am old fashioned but I want specifications like the range of the 2.4ghz connectivity - simple questions right? Can I go outside for a smoke or get a cold soda from the frig without dropping my connection - the vast majority did not list the range of their connectivity or if their app for sound adjustments carried over from PC to console (in my case the Xbox). Fortunately, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X has excellent range - I found that standing next to heavy duty electrical devices - like my Samsung Refrigerator caused interference but not a total disconnect, 75' from the plug in dongle. Moving the Dongle from the XBOX 1X to the PC (2' from each other) and flipping the XBOX/PC switch was a breeze, syncing the headphones was a no brainer, just turn headphones on they sync immediately, on board headphone controls took a little getting used to especially the bluetooth on/off and the headphones on/off dual switch is poorly labeled with some raised symbols - they should have used some paint to distinguish which position is bluetooth vs headphone power - I have to get a flashlight and glasses to see the markings. Other than that the headphone mute is a locking pushbutton with a audible tone and a red LED on the microphone to let u know if mic is on or off - REMEMBER to SHUT MIC OFF if you are retracting the microphone back into the headset or all kinds of weird feedback will occur - obviously since mic will pickup what's coming from that side of the headset. I found after messing around with the app that out of the box flat setting was great for most purposes. I have a very high end Dolby ATMOS/DTS:X 7.3.4 surround system so even though the headphones sound decent as compared to a pair of studio quality recording headphones - nothing compares with my home theater speakers. I could wear these headphones for several hours before my ears started to get too warm. Microphone quality on group IP based teleconferences and via bluetooth for telephone calls is excellent and being able to connect to both the Xbox or PC via Quantum 2.0 over 2.4Ghz and to any bluetooth device, in my case my Galaxy phone simultaneously is a welcome feature. Answering a phone call automatically mutes the microphone to the 2.4Ghz connection whether it be the Xbox or the PC.\nFinally the battery life is pretty amazing - @38 hours for the USB connection only or 26 hours if you have both the USB (2.4Ghz) and the Bluetooth on together. The USB C fast-charge connection on the headphones is very fast with 15-minute charge providing 6 hours of USB time if u are dealing with a completely dead battery - which is an almost impossible situation considering the 38 hour capacity. A real world example is using the headset for 5 hours it took about 15-20 minutes to get it back to 100%.\n\nYou can customize the appearance of the headset with optional matching metal earcup plates and headband in 4 colors Cherry Red, Mint Green, Lilac & Rose Quartz. It comes with all the cables you will need to charge (USB C male to USB A male - 5'), connect USB C Dongle (including a short USB A male to USB C female to connect to Xbox or to a PC if dongle interferes with PC/Laptop USB C port and other connections), and even a 3.5mm to 3.5mm (4 pin to 5 pin) 4' audio cable to connect headset in analog mode to Xbox controller or other analog audio input/output headphone/mic jack. If you need a splitter cable for the analog connection to separate mic/headphone you would need to purchase that separately it is on Steelcase website as is the color upgrade options. It also comes standard with the breathable cloth earpieces which can also be replaced with the vinyl cups if u wish also optional on Steelcase website. A rather cheap clothlike storage bag comes with headset - it will at least keep dust and pet hair off your headset.\n\nI rate this headset 9.5 of 10 considering reduced Amazon price, excellent sound, range, positive connectivity (no disconnects for me at all), battery life, dual simultaneous connectivity 2.4Ghz & Bluetooth, best microphone quality and best software-controlled sound and microphone control - this after trying and returning other major brands in this price range, and comfort/fit, finish.\nThe only minor complaints are the cheap storage bag and the somewhat difficult combination bluetooth power and overall power on/off buttons being one rocker switch and hard to read labeling for that switch - visually the Bluetooth LED indicator is Blue and the overall power button for the 2 way dongle LED is green - so u know u made a mistake after the fact if wrong color LED is lit.\n\nBTW the room I use this headset is LOADED with wi-fi \"smart\" devices including 8 ceiling LED lights, 4 wall sconce LED lights, 2 wi-fi controlled window shades, Amazon Firecube w/Alexa, LG 77\"C1 OLED TV. Xfinity 4K cable box, Xbox1X, all Alexa controlled via 2.4Ghz wireless & hardwired. The key to having all of this in one room is to hardwire as much as possible (main wireless router is in basement, hardwired remote 8 port switch behind A/V racks) - so all of the A/V equipment is hardwired - the lights and shades are 2.4Ghz wi-fi, nothing seems to interfere with the Steelcase 2.4GHz Quantum 2.0 Gaming Wireless connection dongle which is 15' from where I typically sit with headphones.",
                "2": "I wanted a major headset upgrade and decided that I wanted to go wireless. I've been surfing multiple websites and this headset has been mentioned frequently as one of the best in Xbox wireless headsets. With me wondering if I made the right choice, I placed my order and was eager waiting for the headset to arrive.\n\nMy first impression was that the headset is really nice and minimal, with the only contrast being the black-green pattern band. I took the band off as I have an afro and it fits me well.\n\nI really liked how they nailed some of the features of this headset, like the game/chat wheel, the red LED for a muted mic, and the bluetooth function. The bluetooth function is what won me over and it's integrated very well! I was rock solid on this headset and felt like I really made the right choice..........\n\n...that's until I experienced the static and audio drops that this headset is criticized for. I didn't really mind it at first, but all of that changed when I walked out of my room. The headset drops audio almost immediately and if I don't come back in range after a certain period, then it fails to reconnect at all and I have to turn the headset all the way off and then back on. In my case, what use is a wireless headset for if I can't walk out of my room with it?\n\nThis was a major dealbreaker for me. This was my first time with a SteelSeries product and I was beyond disappointed, and was getting ready to return the headset the next day. In my mind, this headset nailed everything but its core feature and was really sad that I was going to return it.\n\nBUT THAT'S UNTIL I decided to swap over from my original Xbox One to the Xbox Series X. I originally bought the xsx for my room but then I gave it to my brother to keep for himself and now waiting for another to ship to me. Before I went with returning the headset, I grabbed the xsx and put it back in my room so if anything improved, it would be in my controlled environment (I also run the Xbox One as mentioned, along with monitors, a desktop computer, and various smart home devices in my small room).\n\nI paired the headset with the series X, hopped in a party, and well... EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! My friends mentioned that my mic quality was better, and I can walk around and out my room with no connection drops. Hell, I was able to walk around a whole 2 story house with little distortion and no audio drops from my party. Much, much, much better range when connected to the Xbox Series X instead of the Xbox One.\n\nI was so happy that I now have a headset that fulfills all my needs and even exceeds in some ways. 2 things I wish this headset had was USB-C and a foam piece for the mic, but that can be bought for cheap. A tip is that if you are going to rock this headset, also buy a \"micro USB magnetic charger\" for convenient snap-on charging.\n\nDefinitely recommend this headset to current and future Series X|S owners.",
                "3": "BUYER BEWARE: DECENT PRODUCT BUT AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! BUY FROM ASTRO, TURTLE BEACH, LUICID SOUND, OR HYPER X INSTEAD! BETTER SOUND AND BUILD QUALITY USUALLY FOR LESS. DONT BELIEVE THE SPONSORED \"BEST HEADSETS\" LISTS!\n\nFirst off, I NEVER take the time to write reviews. Also, I have purchased and used about every flagship wireless surround headset and several higher end wired from every major manufacturer for the past 6 years XBox One has been out. I've purchased them for myself and my three children as well as given them to friends and family due to dissatisfaction for one reason or another. I have owned the Stealth 500X, Stealth Elite 800X, Stealth 700X and the Wired Stealth 90Xfrom Turtle Beach, Wired Cloud Core X and Stinger 2 from Hyper X, Astro A40 and A50 (for both my PS4s and XBox Ones.) If you're wondering why so many, children break things and I usually play with the right earcup slightly offset to hear my family if they call or need something. It typically causes some stress on the plastic frame swivel joints and usually the joint cracks after a year or so. Plus, I'm a technophile/audiophile and I have been chasing the high quality experience that I had with the original Turtle Beach Stealth 500X headset (which was discontinued or I would have bought another)\n\nOverall the product is admittedly good, I really liked the light weight and great sound. Being able to connect to my Bluetooth phone, computer, or stereo on the fly was great. Descent sound quality (a little more flat sounding music and ambiance than others I've used, but it picks up footsteps and game audio cues well) and compatible with Windows Sonic and Dolby Atmos software which helps. Good mic quality too.\n\nHOWEVER, after a few months of regular use and good care the left ear driver stated intermittently going out. I called customer service when it stopped working all together and they walked me through some troubleshooting and showed me how to do the factory reset using a paperclip to press the reset located in the ear piece. This would take care of the problem for a while, but ultimately it ended up failing and refused to come back on. I was still well within the year warranty so I contacted customer service again and told them what was going on. They informed me that they couldn't verify my purchase because I bought it through a third party retailer (Amazon) so I need to pursue a return though Amazon first. Amazon stated that it wasn't covered in the A-Z policy and it was outside the window for returns. Plus, because it was an accessory that was worn and an electronic, they couldn't give me and exchange or even a partial refund credit.\n\nSo when I contacted SteelSeries again, they had me take a bunch of photos and send an invoice from Amazon, which I did a few different times and they kept telling me it wasn't an official invoice screenshot, (it was a receipt, a purchase confirmation, and a shipment and delivery confirmation email and screenshot for each respective time. All of which had the order number, tracking number and my personal information and address.) So I finally asked them to walk me through which specific invoice I had to generate from Amazon and where to obtain it. Finally, they told me they still couldn't confirm the legitimacy of my purchase and warranty status despite the specified documentation and photographs including the serial number and condition of the headset they had asked for. So they told me to send the product in (which I had to pay for postage on and shipped 2-day priority) after a week I was notified that the battery was dead (no kidding the headset wasn't working at all on one side and I had been using a backup) but stated that nothing was wrong and I just needed to charge it. I got it back and the headset still didn't work on the left side and wasn't wanting to stay on now and kept disconnecting. (Despite having a full overnight charge). The headset also came back with a HORRIBLE stale, sour, body odor smell, which they basically called me a liar about. I had specifically cleaned the ear cushions and let them dry completely) before shipping because I figured someone would be having to put it on. Plus, I always kept my headset on a stand and wiped it down after playing as I'm a bit of a clean freak. I knew it was B.S. and it upset me that they kept telling me the headset was fine and that there was no odor.\n\nThey finally told me I could send it back (Again, my cost) so I sent it as is to prove the odor existed and told them I was doing so. Once again told me that nothing was wrong. They kept indirectly insinuating that I was a liar or just trying to get over on them and get a new headset. Then told me that the headset was stinking when they received it and basically suggested that it was due to my personal hygiene.\n\nI would think that SteelSeries wouldn't appreciate a few lazy or dirtbag employees ruining their brand's reputation by being rude or discourteous to customers, but it sure as hell happened. I don't think they ever tested the headset properly or at all. The fact that they didn't help at all, called me a liar, and I was left with a stinking broken headset now outside the warranty window and I guess I'm blacklisted because they won't return my messages, despite being polite in my correspondence and always thanking them when they helped remotely.\n\nPretty good headset for the six-months or so it lasts, but absolutely shit-tier customer service that only calls you a liar and refuses to even give you an opportunity to pay for a repair or even give a discount or credit towards a replacement.",
                "4": "I'll start off by saying this was a good headset while it lasted. It was comfortable to wear after breaking in, the ear pads didn't produce sweat, wasn't too tight either. The options to change the input and outputs on the PC app and carry over to Xbox was impressive. Sound in was pretty good, just without a good talk back mechanic. What was there for that feature needed to be turned on and even then it was faint.\n\nMy biggest gripe would be the audio overflow it would seem to bug out. In a lot of cutscenes where maybe explosions would happen or even sometimes loading into a match, it would static out. Preventing you from talking or hearing, like you had a real bad connection to the console. Based off other reviews and other users I've talked to, its a hit or miss per person.\n\nWalking away from the console, even into just around the corner, would disconnect your headset and be difficult to reconnect and possibly just turn off. This is also just a problem with the Series X console, where the controller would do the same and possibly not reconnect even if powered on. The headset followed suit. This issue may have lead to the headset burning out. I disconnected the power from the console, turned it back on, turned on the headset afterwards. The headset beeped like it was powering up but never did. Following suit, it would not turn on again, nor charge on any cables. It wouldn't even connect hardwired to my console or PC. I believe the headset just short circuited somehow during its own boot up.\n\n*EDIT: changed score from 2-4 stars. The headset seemed to had hard locked itself in some bizarre fashion and just needed a press on the reset button. If anyone else has the same issue, it’s under the ear cuff of the non mic side/ side with all the buttons and charger. Needs a paper clip to reach through the tiny hole.\n\nTLDR, Good headset if it stays in the same room as your device, but will still have connectivity issues during heavy audio loads on series x.",
                "5": "I purchased these despite the reported issues with connectivity. And I noticed when I purchased it I had no offer to add a protection plan. This was concerning.\n\nI received my headset and charged them, but they appeared fully charged. I then hooked them up to my laptop to adjust the settings and check for firmware updates. Surprisingly, there was no update and I appear to have the same version that has been out with reported issues.\nKnowing that I didn't want to use the Bluetooth feature and after reading about others experience. I decided to disable the Bluetooth auto connect feature in the steelseries engine.\n\nI synched my headset to my Xbox and viola! They certainly sound great. The volume isn't excessive, but that's probably for the best. They sound fantastic and I noticed directional audio was very good.\n\nAfter one match in the new COD MW. I was in the menu when I noticed the first sign of crackling.\n\nI grew concerned considering the price tag.\nBut I continued. The crackling would occasionally occur, more commonly with the menu soundtrack.\n\nThen in game there were a few instances of the audio momentarily dropping.\n\nI was trying anything I could think to determine the cause. I tried turning off Bluetooth devices around me.\n\nIt was then I notice it happens more when I move abruptly. This made me fear it was a hardware issue such as loose parts.\n\nAfter giving up to find the cause of the issue, I continued playing.\n\nAt some point the headset disconnected entirely despite still being powered on. I was sure I was going to return them at this point.\n\nBut I wanted to game. So after reading guidance I found online. I shut off the headset. Hard reset my console. And smoked a cigarette.\n\nSince I turned it on after this, I have had no issues. Even if I move my head more than I naturally would.\n\nNow this was about 18 hours ago. I'm about to use them again and hope there are no issues.\n\nIf it's a firmware issue I don't mind waiting for an update. Because if I have no more issues, then the troubles I had in the first few hours after initially connecting no longer occur. Then these deserve 5 stars.\n\nI may update my review of anything changes. I bought them with confidence the connectivity issues have had ample time to be addressed and resolved. However I did have the same reported issues initially.\n\nIf they don't have anymore connection issues, these are hands down 5 stars.\n\nThis may be the most comfortable headset I have ever worn. And they sound great.\nFor the price, I expect the quality. And if the connection issues persist then the headset is unbearable to use. I hope they last and I don't run into many more issues.\n\nI definitely recommend them. The only caveat is the present connection issues that commonly occur. If you get a pair, try what I did and troubleshoot. Because now that they have been working, I'm very happy with them. I'm hoping they continue to work well because it would be sad for such a great product to become useless due to one significant flaw.",
                "6": "Pros:\n- Great audio quality\n- Has 3 different connection methods and you can use all of then simultaneously: Bluetooth, 3.5mm jack (no mic available) and Xbox connection (console or Xbox dongle). This is the main reason I bought this one over other premium headphones, I use 3 devices (PC via Xbox dongle, android via 3.5mm jack and iPhone via Bluetooth). I control the volume in each of the device's audio system separately and the volume wheel in the headphone is a separated master volume, so it works perfectly.\n- The mic in the Xbox mode is one of the best I experienced for wireless mics. Of course it is not as good as an wired high quality mic, but it's really good (I don't have an Xbox, but I use an Xbox dongle on PC).\n- Long battery life. I use it all day long and charge it at night. The battery does last more than a day, but it dies in the middle/end of the second day of use.\n- Comfortable, but nothing extraordinary like some reviews I saw before buying said. The headband is adjustable and I had some difficult to find the right setting (the headphone would start falling from my head if I tilted it down a little at first), but no problems after I found it.\n- The headphone works while charging.\n\nCons:\n- The mic in Bluetooth mode is really bad, use the Xbox mode Bluetooth if you care about this.\n- While the Bluetooth mic is in use, the audio you listen to will also be bad, like phone call quality (the quality changes from Stereo to Hands-Free mode). This is a limitation of the current Bluetooth technology, all Bluetooth headphone have this problem. This problem also doesn't happen in Xbox mode, only Bluetooth.\n- The secondary volume wheel didn't work. It was supposed to control volume ratio game/voice call. Maybe it only works for Xbox (I don't have one), it didn't work when I tried on phone calls and Discord. I don't really care for this, so I didn't ask for warranty.\n- You don't have access to the mic in the 3.5mm jack connection mode.\n- Noise suppression is not that good.",
                "7": "These headphones are great enough that I'm overlooking the few negatives I have with them to give it a full five stars. I know a lot of people probably care about sound quality the most, and that is how I started my title, but I'm going to go with comfort first. I've worn these headphones upwards of 3 hours straight on a work call and barely even knew they were on my head. The adjustment strap is a little wonky and takes some getting used to, but it keeps the bulk of the headphones off your head, and the ear cups feel like cotton balls.\n\nNext, sound quality is out of this world. These sound better than my wired Sennheiser studio headphones. The mic quality, so far as I can tell, is great as well. I like being able to adjust the mic (my other headphones have a tiny mic hole built into one of the ear cups). And while I can oftentimes hear myself when I'm speaking (which is how I can tell the mic quality is en pointe), I don't hate hearing my voice like I would in other situations, like a recording of my voice.\n\nI also love that I can use the headphones (with mic) using a 3.5mm aux cable because my work computer has Bluetooth disabled, which I learned after buying these.\n\nNow for a shocker: I actually hate how the headphones adjust. I know, I know: I just said that helped make the headphones super comfy. Yes, that's true. But it's a springy strap with a hook-and-loop patch on one end: when the set is on my head, the strap wants to contract, making it tough to adjust. Then because I guess I have a smaller head, the two hook-and-loop patches don't meet, meaning there's a loose end of the strap that kinda flaps around. Annoying, but not a deal breaker.\n\nThe other con is that these headphones are frustratingly difficult to connect over Bluetooth when multiple devices are paired. Even looking at the directions, I can't figure out what to push in what order to get them to switch, and I usually take a few minutes to get them to work on the computer I want to use them with. Frustrating, but I can live with it.",
                "8": "Received in May 2021what I consider being my first gaming headset. Since then I've gone back and forth from enjoying it to feeling like I wasted two hundred on an auditory illusion that at times is outperformed by a sixty-dollar Astro headset that I don't even consider to be for gaming. It definitely brought familiar areas in games to life in a way I never experienced before which is great but virtual surround sound is virtually useless without visual cues and map memorization. You can gain a competitive edge it's just not as straightforward or effective as surround sound. Of course, that's with every headset. That aside, these sound great when gaming out of the box and can be adjusted using a PC. They're not loud and lack base but you can hear every little sound clearly. The design is light and comfortable to use. I'm surprised they dropped the ball using a micro USB port and a volume dial that goes from 0 to max from the slightest touch. I didn't think the port was that big of a deal when reading other reviews but it doesn't connect easily and if it breaks then it's game over and goodbye to my $200. The broken volume dial renders the headphone jack unusable. It feels like a cheap set you wouldn't spend $10 on. For the price, you'd think they'd be my go-to headphones for devices like my pricey mind machine but I'd much rather use cheap Astros or earbuds. Again, this is when using the jack.\n\nAs for the dual-function Bluetooth/wifi, this headset's main selling point, the connection quality is hit or miss and I don't have anything to compare it to. The battery lasts forever. It has never failed me even when I forget to charge it. The dual function is great and if that's what you're looking for, idk of any other headset that has this feature at least at the time I purchased it. If you need it, this is a solid purchase. If you don't care then it's a hard sell and I wouldn't recommend any headset unless you must have one for practical reasons. Otherwise, as far as performance, you're much better off getting an actual surround sound system. I had a cheap Sony that didn't cost much more than these virtual surround headphones. If you live in an apartment, have roommates, kids, or whatever, I get it. Just don't get caught up in the hype and think you're buying something comparable.\n\nI don't regret the purchase and have found many uses for it outside of gaming. If you play Destiny then you will probably understand when I say I hate these Steelseries, they're my favorite headphones.",
                "9": "Okay, I should preface this review by saying I’m not a pro gamer and have very little experience with headphones—none with purpose-built “gaming” headphones. With that said, I’ve used these pretty extensively for the past several weeks and have developed some definite “likes” and “dislikes”. Here’s my two cents:\n\n- - - Things I DON’T like - - -\n\nTHE POWER BUTTON\n\nThe power button is small and hard to find. On that very small button is a tiny little bump that lets you know it’s the power button, since it’s literally right next to the Bluetooth button. For me and my hands, it’s so small, I can barely feel it.\n\nWhen the power button is pressed to turn on the headset, it makes a single beep sound. That’s supposed to tell you it’s turned on, but there is no recorded voice inside that says “power on”, and you get the same sound when you push it again to “power off”. I have a much cheaper pair of wireless headphones that DO give that audible message, so maybe I’m just spoiled.\n\nThe only way to discern “power on” from “power off” (besides noise in your ears if you’re listening to something) is that the dongle light gets brighter when powered on. But if it’s plugged into the back of your PC, that’s not going to be any help.\n\nTHE DONGLE\n\nThe dongle seems to work fine on my PC, after I made sure the tiny switch on it was in the “USB” position (it shipped in the “Xbox” position). I haven’t tested how far I can get away from it, because I only use it at my desk, and my PC is literally on the desk next to me.\n\nBut here’s the bad thing about the dongle: it’s so wide that there’s no way to plug it into my machine—in front, or back on the MOBO—without using the included extension cord. It would have been nice if the engineers had designed it so that it was either skinnier, like a thumb drive, or at least had a little longer neck, so you could plug it in next to other plugs.\n\nCHATMIX VOLUME MIXER\n\nI love the concept, and I do appreciate a way to turn up or down (or off) the team chatter, while increasing or decreasing the actual game sounds. But the wheel used for that is very loose and has very little resistance. There is a tactile “notch” when the wheel is in the very center, indicating equal chat and game sounds, but it would be nice to have more resistance, and an easier-to-feel notch when centered.\n\nREMAINING POWER\n\nThe primary way to know how much power is remaining in your headphones is to remove them and look at the slowly flashing light next to the power button. Green is 100–50%, Yellow is 49–15%, Red is 14–5%, and fast-blinking Red is 4-1%.\n\nThe only other way is to open the GG software, and then near the bottom there is “Engine”. Click on that, then under the “Gear” category tab, you will see your headset with a remaining power indication in percentage, which is much more accurate than guessing where you are based on the green indicating 50 to 100%.\n\nIt would really be nice to have an audible “low power” indication in the headset to warn me, as well as a percentage of remaining power upon startup. But from what I can tell, there is none. If there is, I haven’t heard it, and it’s not listed in the very minimal “user manual” or the manufacturer’s website.\n\nTHE STAND\n\nThere is no stand that comes with the headphones, but I did find a really nice one ",
                "10": " that works great for me. It’s magnetic, inexpensive, and folds up.\n\nSOFTWARE\n\nIf you choose to download the GG software, you’ll have some more options to tweak the headphones. But I still can’t get the mic recording and playback testing functions to work in the software. Clicking the record button does nothing. No biggie, I’m able to use the Windows device test, but that part of the software is definitely a fail, despite removing and re-installing the program.\n\nAlso, I was confused about many of the settings; for example, should I use the clearcast AI noise cancellation, or the more tweakable noise reduction settings? I couldn’t tell any difference at all, but if you’re someone who likes to fiddle with settings, this is for you.\n\nDEVICE CONFUSION\n\nWhen the GG Sonar software is installed, it generates a half dozen different ‘devices’ in the device list, and you have to switch to one of them to turn on the headphones. And there is no information anywhere to tell you which of these devices to switch to.\n\nMost of them will let you hear through the headphones, but which do you choose? Will one or more activate the GG Sonar software, while others will not? It’s infuriating to spend $200 on a pair of gaming headphones but have no information on how to properly use them.\n\nThere is no way to have your PC automatically switch to the headphones when you turn them on, nor is there a way to have your PC switch back to the default speakers when you power them off. Again, this should not be hard to do.\n\nThe last nitpicky thing I can whine about is that there are no L and R indicators anywhere. So when you pick up the headphones, you need to search for the little retracted mic, which goes on the left side. It might have been nice to print a big L and R in the headphone, so I wouldn’t have to scrutinize it before putting it on. Yeah, I know that’s being really picky, but I’m trying to relay everything.\n\n+++ Things I DO like +++\n\nCOMFORT\n\nThe headset is very comfortable, and it doesn’t squeeze my head. I have an average-sized brain bucket, size 7¼, so those with a bigger noggin might feel differently. The ear cup pillows are fabric-covered foam (not memory foam, just regular foam), so my ears don’t get hot and sweat like some leatherette ones do.\n\nBut that comfort comes at a cost, which is that the outside noise pretty much just comes right in. My PC is on my desk next to me, and I can hear my CPU and GPU fans screaming right through the headphones. My much cheaper headphones with active noise cancellation and leatherette pillow seals block out 100% of that noise, while these block out about 40%.\n\nTHE MIC\n\nI do like the mic, and how it retracts. It comes out pretty easily, is easy to adjust, and stays where you put it. Although it’s not going to beat a dedicated studio mic, it sounds pretty good.\n\nThere’s an easy-to-find button on the back of the left ear cup about halfway up that mutes the mic. The button pops out when muted, and a light comes on at the end of the mic that is easy to see, but not obnoxious.\n\nINTEROPERABILITY\n\nI absolutely love that these 7x headphones can be used on just about any device. Between the ‘tooth capability and the Wi-Fi dongle, you can use these on the PS5, Xbox, Switch, cell phone (Android or iOS), PC, Mac, or pretty much any other Bluetooth device. They even come with a 3.5mm cable, which adds even more possibilities. I am not aware of any other headphones that are as versatile as these.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nAlthough I listed a lot of dislikes, overall I do like the headphones, so I kept them. But honestly, I have a much less expensive set of headphones with ‘tooth and Wi-Fi, as well as ANC, that are just as comfortable and sound just as good to me. For those and the above reasons, these Arctis Nova 7x headphones get an average score of three stars.\n\nI hope some of this helps!",
                "11": "After using these for about a month now I can say this really is a great headset. I used to be a loyal Turtle Beach customer, 3 headsets in a row over more than a decade, but since they haven’t released a new flagship in awhile, I decided to finally give the competition a try.\n\nFor starters the construction is great as you should expect from a $150+ pair of headphones. I’ve always been wary of the dual band (solid segment and adjustable strap or part) because it essentially makes 2 points of failure in addition to possible balance issues but thankfully, the 9X has a metal support band and it feels fantastic. It keeps it centered where you place it on your head very well and should last much longer than a plastic band. The strap surpassed my expectations. It is easily adjustable and the flexibility feels like it was made specifically for putting something on your head, not to mention it is soft and doesn’t cause chafing at all. The earcups are essentially monolithic solid pieces. The only piece that is a worry for failure, especially from fatigue, is the connection between the earcups and the band. It is just a single piece of curved plastic and not all that thick. Its connection points between the band and earcups seem to be metal standoffs or similar (bearings and whatnot) so that should be okay (it's the general design SteelSeries has been using for a long time so I assume it works). They hopefully shouldn’t be all that load bearing but it is the only segment I would improve in the design. The volume scroll wheels feel good, not too loose not too stiff.\n\nI was impressed with the comfort of these. I have glasses and have 0 issues whatsoever. In fact, I would say if you are WORRIED about the comfort with glasses with headsets I might point you towards these specifically for that itself. The cushions feel nice and are more breathable than I expected. There has been one heck of a heat wave recently so I’ve been gaming in 80+ degrees inside and haven’t experienced any sweating issues (I don’t sweat all that much in general however). The distance from the cushions to the speakers is not that deep, if you have ears that stick out farther than average you may find yourself rubbing the inside. The squeeze on the head isn’t much, I saw some reviews spitting out values but it doesn’t mean anything till you try. Playing for hours on end I haven’t had any soreness, pain, etc. from the pressure but I am extremely used to wearing headphones so it may just be me. The cushions do help though, no hotspots or pressure points. The moveability of the earcups with the help of the strap should allow basically anyone to find a comfortable position with this headset.\n\nOn to sound. I’m not much of an audiophile and haven’t 100% tested these to every sound degree but I can agree with some online reviews that they aren’t the best for listening to music. It seems like the mixing is very tailored to games. It doesn’t sound bad by any means but the default sound presets (flat, bass boost, smiley, focus) do not bring out anything music wise and I find myself using “flat” almost exclusively since it provides the best range imo. In-game I find no issues: they do their job, have good surround, and catch everything happening but I personally can’t find much difference between these and my old Turtle Beach XO 7 pro (rip old friend) aside from maybe very minor frequency equalization. In the SteelSeries pc download you can adjust very little to actually mix the headset yourself so it is mostly what you get at the start. The volume adjust (and speech vs in-game) provides enough to find the level you want. It had noise canceling I believe and there's no option to turn it off but I think it mitigates decently enough, I’m no longer in a louder environment so it is hard for me to tell.\n\nI’d say this is a very ergonomic headset to wear: the retractable mic is a lot cooler and better than I expected, I’ve said previously you can easily get it to sit comfortably on your head, and the buttons are spread out and feel different enough to find everything quickly and easily. Connecting to both an Xbox and PC or phone are easy as heck and it is incredibly cool you can do both at once. It definitely provides an avenue to play cross-plat games with people in a discord. The microphone is clear and sounds great. The battery life is phenomenal (and one of the main reasons I chose this over the Turtle Beach Stealth 700). Right out of the box it lasted me the whole week, at least 20 hours. I have been charging it once a week since, with the charge time being fast enough to take a break, watch some shows or something, and you’re good to go.\n\nOkay, everything sounds great so far but, headsets are VERY unique per person and I do have quite a few gripes. It has been said before that it takes like 6-7 seconds to turn them on and yeah, it does. No reason for it to be more than 2-3 seconds to hold that dumb power button. I’ve experienced a few instances where I turn them on, they connect, and then they turn off again within a second or two. Really weird but it has never happened in-game or anything. It may be some sequencing thing with my xbox and controller, I dunno, but it has happened more than I would like. The mic is INCREDIBLY sensitive, be wary. I never, ever, ever, have had a problem with my headsets picking up my fans before but now I do, it was so bad I almost returned them instantly. I went into the SteelSeries Engine and there is a mic volume option which I turned down to the minimum. It mitigated it enough to where I can use them and even when it does “pick” it up, I think it doesn't really register any sound now. I had to adjust my overall setup to accommodate for this and it now can pick up me just walking around due to the air moving, a bit of an issue since I like to pace. This caused me to sound fairly quiet in chat though so I had to move the mic closer to my mouth than I used to. I think it would do SteelSeries good to have a foam tip or some other method to prevent air/fan issues and general noise damping. Having the buttons and scroll wheels on the back of the earcups sounds like a good idea in principle, easy to reach, out of the way, etc. but on these they are so spread out and the scroll wheels are almost exactly where you put your hands when grabbing the headset to pick up and put down that you need to be careful not to touch them, else you have to change your volume back every single time you use them. Just a nitpick I know, I plan on getting a vertical stand for these so I don't lay the headset down on its side for this reason too. The little booklet they include is basically as minimal as you can get. The look is pretty basic, it was probably what they were going for but if the strap didn’t have the green X flair it would look like a generic solid matte black headset. I like a bit of spice, some highlights here and there ya know, nothing too much but something subtle would be nice. I’m not a super serious sound mixing studio enthusiast needing to be professional but I’m also not some RGB psycho, everyone's tastes are different.\n\nAll in all, this is a really good gaming headset. It’s hard NOT to recommend. I definitely endorse spending the extra money to get a headset at least in the $100+ range as the difference between a $50-70 and an $100-150 is night and day. At the end of the day, you simply have to test things like this out to see if it works for you. I truly, almost returned it due to the mic issue alone (I literally activated the return but fiddled with it until I got it usable) but after using it for a month now, I do enjoy it. There’s a lot of options out there and trying everything would take not only a lot of $$$ but a lot of time too, something not many of us have, so if I can find something that I can get to at least WORK, I am usually content"

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "Recon 200 Gen 2 is equipped with 40 mm drivers with a bass boost. Also, for a deeper experience, this headset is equipped to send spatial audio through technology such as Windows Sonic, Dolby Atmos or DTS: 3D X and Sony audio headphones. This is a messy headset that can hold 12 hours of charge through the included USB Type-C cables, making the audio harder and fuller. Unlike other cluttered headphones, if Recon 200 Gen 2 runs out of juice during the playback session it will continue to run passive headphones with 3.5mm input.\n\nThe ear cushions are made of breathable memory foam that helps keep the headphones from being too hot during a longer gaming session with lightweight metal-strengthened headbands to the head comfort.\n\nRecon 200 Gen 2 works as a passive headphone, but it shines when the amplifier is turned on. When using Recon to listen to my PC Thuthh music, the source sounds fuller on the PS setting, so I keep it on juice.\n\nWhen the beefed up sound is turned on in the 200 gen 2 sound, it sounds fantastic. Other fortified headphones don't work at all when they don't have a charge, but Recon 200 Gen 2 will work as a passive headphone when the battery dies, although in passive state, the sound quality is dated but nothing is written home.\n\nClosing comment:\n\nThe amplification does a lot of things to boost the sound by raising the low end and making Eventning sound fuller. Being run as passive headphones is a nice feature because it makes the Recon 200 never out of commission, but there is a decrease in sound quality that is famous when used as passive headphones. By switching the settings between Xbox and PlayStation, it ensures that users can get optimal feedback for whichever console they use.",
                "2": "First: the main complaint people have about these actually appears to be caused by the user failing to charge them. Yes, they are wired (auxiliary vs. Bluetooth) headphones, and many wired headphones don't require charging to fully work... But these have 'standard' and 'powered' modes, and the latter will drain the internal battery after a few long sessions, after which they automatically revert to the 'standard' mode.\n\nIn 'standard' mode, they work perfectly fine for output, but the microphone doesn't work well; others can hardly hear you (if they can hear you at all.)\nIn the 'powered' modes (Xbox or PS,) the output is amplified, frequency response improves dramatically, and the mic becomes super crisp. I do find the Xbox vs PS switch perplexing; both modes work (for both out- and input) with my Xbox Series X, but I actually find the PS mode provides better sound for me. There are also dials above the 'mode switch' for both the output and microphone volumes.\n\nOnce dead, they don't take a terribly long time to re-charge, and I even found that if they happen to die while I'm in a party, I can simply use my extra long USB-C phone charger to plug them in and continue to use the 'powered.' So, while the need to charge them is a slight annoyance, I really like that I don't have to stay on top of it to make sure they don't die.\n\nThey are very lightweight and comfortable; as someone with a smaller head, I've found many headsets will end up either gradually slipping off, or feeling so heavy that I get a headache over time. Not so with these! I can even wear thick-rimmed blue light blocking glasses without issue. The headband has supple pleather cushioning, and the ear cups are cushy and lined with fine mesh. When not in use, the ear cups will fold out so as to flatten, making it easy to put them in a case if you're going somewhere.\n\nAll in all, for the price I'd say these are exceptional gaming headphones. I've had both generic headsets ~$15 cheaper than these, and specialty headsets that were at least double the price... And these far outrank both. I'd absolutely recommend them, along with a 10ft USB-C cable just in case you find out mid-game that you forgot to re-charge them ;)",
                "3": "very good headset for the price.\nthe sound quality is very very nice and i can enjoy both music and gaming with this headset so it is all around good in sound.\nbe aware that the mic quality is not good. it’s very quiet even on max settings everything turned up loud as possible.\nalso, the headset is noise cancelling so you probably won’t be aware that ur being loud if u rage at games cuz it cancels a lot of outside sound (which is good for gaming, just maybe not good if u have roommates or sensitive neighbors). i don’t like however that when i moved my head around i can hear the crackly sound of the plastic headphones adjusting. tbh this is just because the whole outside casing is all hard plastic. it doesn’t really affect anything, but my mic picks up the cracking sounds sometimes, which i don’t love.\nthe headband is comfortable and i can wear the headphones a long time with no discomfort. also i can fit my ears inside the cups perfectly fine with earrings on too and have no pressure on my ears or anything. someone with larger ears might not want to choose this headset tho because the ear cups are just average sized to slightly small i feel like.\n\nall around good headset tho: 8/10.",
                "4": "It is near IMPOSSIBLE to find non-Sony headphones that don't sound like complete trash on PS4. That is why I am VERY happy with these Turtle Beach headphones.\n\nOn Passive they sound just fine with the volume near the top, great for saving the batteries when on menus or loading screens. When the game starts or watching cutscenes the Active mode sounds incredible! Bass is more than adequate, and the mids and highs are not overpowering like most headsets at this pricepoint.\n\nAnother reviewer said when Turtle Beach comes out with a mid-range headset, buy it! I agree, at least for PS4.\n\nAs for PC, haven't gamed with this set, but videos and classes are ok on passive and just simply loud with active mode. Does not work well with Spotify.\n\nDid not test on xbox",
                "5": "I wanted to get an inexpensive headset for my new PS5 and I hit a homerun with this headset! After hooking the 3.5mm jack into my controller, I followed the included instructions and set up my PS5 for the output audio. It even had a test for 3D audio and it is on point! My first MW3 Zombie campaign was so much better when I could tell which direction enemies were coming from and trying to sneak up behind me. I found that I can use my 6 ft. USB-C cable to charge while using it, so I will never have to worry about down time. The mic is not obtrusive and is out of my sight line when lowered. I do like the flip up to mute feature, less ambiguity than a toggle switch. I haven't tried using them in the \"off\" or unpowered mode because...why, it has power, use it and enjoy it.\nThe cushion is comfortable and didn't make me hot over a long session. I have small ears, but after 3 hours your ears may be a little sensitive to the areas that touch or stay in contact, under pressure. No biggy, take em off, take a break and go look at nature. Fine when I had to also wear reading glasses as well, no pressure spots. Very good balance of sound and the additional volume wheel for hearing your voice better over the headset is great.\nFor less than $40, these were well regarded by a couple of review sites and did not disappoint me at all, I highly recommend them,",
                "6": "These are junk, I found a different glasses-friendly brand to replace with (see end of review). I purchased these headphones at the end of December 2022, received first week of Jan 2023. Brand new, not refurbished. They lasted ~5 weeks before the sound went out in one ear (right ear). This is within the warranty period (60 days). I submitted the warranty claim - what a joke. This is not my first warranty claim on an item, but this is the first one where I will just eat the original cost of purchase and count it lesson learned and never buy from them again. I will say - when these worked they were fine and were very glasses friendly - WHEN they worked.\n\nI got my RMA with shipping ticket, along with a long e-mail of instructions, caveats, and terms.\nFirst: you have to provide the shipping box - that costs $.\nSecond: It takes 10-14 BUSINESS DAYS from when they receive it for them to ship out a replacement. Combined with shipping time and weekends you are without your product for 3-5 WEEKS. I barely even owned it for 5 weeks before it broke!\nThird: They do not have to replace you item with a new item. They can give you a refurbished item. That's used. I purchased a brand new item and owned it less than two months - I should receive a brand new replacement.\nFourth: From my RMA, \"If a package shows clear signs of tampering or abuse, or if it is shipped in a dangerous or unsanitary condition\" Turtle Beach has the right to reject it and return it at the customer expense or just dispose of it. Ok, dangerous or unsanitary, I get, although in 60 days even the nastiest person can only do so much. But package tempering or abuse - the customer can't control that! So if UPS (their chosen carrier) damages my package then I am to blame?\nFinally: The warranty on the replacement item is 30 days or whatever was left on your original warranty, whichever is greater. So, you started with a joke warranty period, your product was defective, and you want the customer to believe this new one will work fine but give LESS coverage time.\n\nClearly, Turtle Beach knows their product is pure dung.\n\nI have now replaced this junk with the Steelseries Arctis Nova 3 for $40 more. After about 20 hours of use I can say they are VERY glasses friendly, which is what I wanted. I had initially avoided the Steelseries because the pairs my husband and kid owned squished my frames when I tried them, but these do not. Considering the longevity of those Steelseries, I don't expect a warranty claim to be necessary.",
                "7": "Sounds great, comfortable and worked great with PS4",
                "8": "These fit nicely and having the ability to move microphone out of the way is great. Big down side is the volume. Even with system settings and volume wheel at max they are still super quiet.",
                "9": "I do enjoy this headset very much. It is a pretty big step up from my other headset which was the Turtle Beach Recon 70. It's also way more comfortable on your ears.\n\nThe base is pretty good which can really move your ears sometimes. The audio is clear, you can hear a lot more playing your games.\n\nMy friends tell me that I sound clear using the mic while I talk to them. I like the fact that when you turn on the audio enhancer, you can actually adjust the mic to be able to hear yourself, so now I'm not talking louder than I need to.\n\nYou can still use the headset without the audio enhancer, however, the audio is pretty quiet. Even having it on max volume, you barely hear anything. But when it's all charged up and you turn on the audio enhancer... it can get pretty freaking loud.\n\nFor the price point, it's fair. I do recommend it. Make sure it's charged and ready to go if you want the best experience with it.",
                "10": "The Turtle Beach Recon 200 Gen 2 Powered Gaming Headset offers compatibility across various gaming platforms, I use it on Xbox one, the Xbox series X and PC with a 3.5mm connection. Its black design is sleek and the headset provides a comfortable fit for extended gaming sessions. I wear glasses and it fits over the frames. I really enjoyed its amplified audio for an immersive gaming experience but battery life is not impressive. However, some have mentioned concerns about build durability over time which I do find concerning as well as I don't think it will stand up to daily use. Overall, it's a solid choice for multi-platform casual gamers seeking reliable performance at an affordable price."

                "1": "This was super fun to play, the graphics were great and I enjoyed the gameplay. This was a great introduction to RE games for me. I would highly recommend it.",
                "2": "The best game in the world. Delivery was very fast.",
                "3": "Good remake, the game is very enjoyable",
                "4": "Easily one of the best resident evil games made for movement/mechanics and just shear fun. This remake for ps5 is great!",
                "5": "The original Resident Evil 4 on the gamecube was one of my favorite games of all time. This remake in my opinion is much better. The world is much more fun to explore. The knife mechanic is awesome, really adds depth to the combat. There are so many new and better lines of dialogue in this game. I love how much more the merchant has to say. The only graphical issue I notices was with the rain when it hits the giant troll in the cinematic just after you defeat him. The spatters appear as bright white spots that look funny. But it's a super small gripe, graphically the game looks great, not just realistic but also artistically creative. It took me over 20 hours to beat it the first time so it's lengthy just like the original. This is a very faithful remake, sure they cut out some stuff but for me I didn't mind at all. All the major stuff is here and new stuff added. I highly recommend this game, especially for Resident Evil fans.",
                "6": "This game was absolutely amazing, I honestly didn't expect it was going to be so good. Very recommended, I can tell they surpassed the original version of the game.",
                "7": "Resident Evil 4 Remake lived up to the hype I had for it, I was blown away by all of the story improvements done over the original with Ashley Graham and Luis Sera for instance. They had better character development than in the original while having more compelling personalities. The RE Engine gameplay fit RE4 pretty well and expanded on the OG's gameplay amazingly by increasing the aggression of the enemies to match Leon's improved movedset. Areas that were originally linear pathways were given a more explorable approach, feeling more akin to the gameplay of classic REs. The weapon selection was improved along with the Merchant now giving leon more side-tasks to do beyond the original 15 medallions mission in OG RE4. The first Krauser fight was reworked into an actual boss fight versus a QTE memory game.\n\nThe main flaws of the game were Ada Wong's character direction in the Remake, the actress didn't seem to give it her all like with the other cast members. Either that or the director had odd ideas about Ada's portrayal. They cutout a couple areas in the game including a boss fight in order to save for later, which is annoying. Lastly, the bonus modes such as Mercenaries and Separate Ways weren't available at launch. While Separate Ways wasn't in the first launch of OG RE4 too, Mercenaries plus Assignment Ada were however. Mercs is in the game now via update, but it still doesn't have 2 characters that were in the original. There's also the fact Micro Transactions are included in the game, which hurts the score a bit.\n\nOverall, despite the flaws; it's still an excellent Remake that in my opinion matches the original in excellence. Just now it's more serious in many ways and overall has now an Action-Survival Horror vibe instead of being Action Horror. Fans of the silly action in the original RE4 will not like the more serious way, but the fans of RE being more horror-focus will more likely love this. I see it as a new, alternative way to play Resident Evil 4. and it perhaps will be my favorite way to play RE4 for years to come.",
                "8": "Capcom has done it again. RE4 remake is just as much of a masterpiece as the original version and but even more so. This remake had the same love and care and attention to detail while respecting the legacy of the original ad the Resident Evil 2 remake did. The graphics are top notch (especially after the most recent update, I also added screenshots from my gameplay) game play is addicting, and the environments are all amazingly recreated. I’m on my 3rd replay now and I’m still not tired of playing it! There are some great reasons to go back and replay with features such as new game plus and harder difficulties being added. The Mercenaries mode was just added too (it’s free DLC so you have to download it from the PSN store). If you are a RE fan, this is a no-brained. Capcom is doing a fantastic job with their remakes and I can’t wait to see which one is next! (Hoping it’s Code Veronica)",
                "9": "I love this game! Loved the original and loved this remake. I keeps you wanting to keep playing even if it's late and every chapter has more guns and fun than the last (gun and fun time for a reason, stranger!).\n\nTotally recommend!",

                "1": "I was very impressed with the overall feel and look of the wheel and pedals. It is a great assembly for beginners but it's definitely good enough for the intermediate drivers. Leather wrapped wheel aluminum shift lever and pedals. The force feedback takes a little getting used to but once you get past that it's an extremely well made unit. Definitely worth the money",
                "2": "Great wheel for beginners. It's made my racing games so much more exciting! Right from the start, I could tell that Logitech put some serious effort into making this wheel top-notch. The build quality is solid, and it feels comfortable in my hands, even during those long gaming sessions.\n\nNow, let's talk about the force feedback. It's pretty awesome, I won't lie. When I'm racing, I can actually feel the wheel responding to the road conditions, giving me a more immersive experience. It adds that extra level of realism that gets my heart pumping. And the pedals are no slouch either. They're super responsive, allowing me to accelerate, brake, and shift gears with precision.\n\nOh, and here's the best part: the G923 works seamlessly with both PCs and consoles. So, no matter which platform you prefer, you can enjoy the thrills of this racing wheel. If you're a racing game fan like me and want to step up your game, the Logitech G923 Racing Wheel is definitely worth considering. It's a solid upgrade that brings a touch of realism to your virtual races. Get ready for some seriously fun and immersive racing sessions!",
                "3": "Son says he loves using the steering wheel, great performance, he doesn't complain about any lagging, says he loves it, light weight easy to set up and use",
                "4": "The Logitech G923 has been around for a while and there are tons of them out there. This is good for compatibility and plug&play hardware. The interface with almost all gaming rigs is a proven design that works. The G923 wheel is a very nice item, reasonably small and light, well made, lots of mounting options, and good reliability. The force feedback system really does work, especially if you take the time to tune it to specific tracks or cars. The pedal set is what brought my rating down to 4 stars. It's pretty ancient, the same pedals they've been using forever, and they're not remarkably reliable or durable. It's unfortunate that Logitech has chosen to sell their mediocre base level pedals with what is a pretty good wheel.",
                "5": "Nice wheel. Force Feedback is realistic!",
                "6": "I've used this steering wheel for many different games such as F1 22, Forza, Asetto Corsa and lots more. Wheel works really great. It has amazing force feedback. Unfortunately the acceleration meter doesn't work on many games however that didn't bother me much. Overall great wheel.",
                "7": "I've had high end sim wheels, pedals... the whole setup. You can have just as much fun with this wheel and pedal set. I play F1 23 (PC) and the wheel is plenty responsive and smooth, as are the pedals. The force feedback isn't nearly as strong as a direct drive, but it doesn't detract from the experience and, in some cases, just makes it easier to drive.\n\nIf you're looking for the full sim feel, you'll have to take it up to the next level, be it Logitech or another brand. But if you're looking for a great wheel setup for enjoying driving games, actually having control, and having software support this is the best bang for your buck.",
                "8": "Wanted to get into sim racing. I have been an avid gamer since gaming came into fruition really. But I have recently found myself becoming bored of the new games and open world and shooters being pumped out yearly. I wanted to still enjoy my hobby of gaming, but how. Well driving of course. I highly enjoy anything with cars, so it was kind of a non brainer for me to get this after deciding. I paired this with the Logitech play seat trophy. Which is lovely combination function and form wise. The steering wheel is good first steering wheel, but we all know there are more expensive and better ones out there. But if you are just getting into sim racing and don't know if you want to spend a grand on just a wheel...this is the perfect entry level option hands down.\nSolid construction. Good materials ..pedals are amazing",

                "11": " I recently picked up iracing, and using a controller I will tell you it's not fun. It limits your ability to feel how the car preforms on track and limits your ability to adjust controls. With this and the shifter that went away for me completely. The stand was part of this purchase and it serves its purpose. The wheel looks amazing and feels amazing to use but part that mounts to the stand or desk (depending on how you mount the wheel and shifter) is a bit big and bulky. But this helps it give you better grip on the wheel while also giving you feedback depending on how you set up the force feed back. With the stand built and the wheel, shifter, and the gas brake and clutch pedal board mounted properly the set up looks amazing! I do love the all black look of the 923 and I am very satisfied with my purchase. But if you're looking to get it for a lower price I recommend you try and get a black Friday deal or a used one that is certified renewed.",
                "12": "This was the safest way to test out wheels. Direct drive is obviously the way to go, but before I spent close to $500 just to get in the door I thought to give the next best thing a whirl. Spent a day trying to tweak settings including what was deemed the holy grail on Reddit. Car would to just start to sway with little to no input. Same race over-and-over 5 times and I was able to shave over a second off time. Promising, but again this was training myself to deal with what was ultimately a bad experience that was further from reality than the controller was.\n\nBiggest point of frustration was oversteer. Out of the throttle gentle steering input and I should be able to walk it back. Real life and the controller. The wheel would just continue into a slide and basically snap out of my hands until the car was so crossed up you were basically along for the ride until it stopped.\n\nOthers obviously get past this and figure things out. Unit feels solid and well built other than next to no rubber on the pedals to keep it from sliding around on the floor. Rig or wheel stand is a must from my short experience. In the end I play as a quick distraction from work and life. Supposed to be fun and cheaper than throwing a Spec Miata together for NASA events. The controller delivers, and doesn’t cause me frustration or the need to sink more money in something that will just take up more space than necessary. SIM racing is cool for some. I’d rather get in a real car. Leave the games as a cheap, fun distraction.\n\nHope this helps someone."

                "46": "I'm in love with this console! The little details on the dock and back of console make it super cute. It's not overwhelming, but is instead classy and cute. The joy con colors are the prettiest brighter pastel green and blue. Honestly, one of the nicest console designs I've seen to date!\n\nI've used this several hours on a nearly daily basis for the last 3 years and it's still in perfect shape. It holds up well and is well loved. I only replaced it to get the oled model so I can see better in bright light which renders this model basically useless. The screen is blacked out by the sun. It's fine indoors, but my son, daughter and husband all have a lite which has a much brighter screen than this.",
                "47": "I love the Animal Crossing version! It's so adorable. I love the colors. Plus it arrived yesterday (July15th) when it originally said I wouldn't get it til around the 18th-24th! Great surprise when it showed up early! Works great! Can't wait to get all my other games & case!",
                "48": "Alright so since the Covid-19 outbreak has officially ruined my sisters senior year she had started getting into animal crossing. After playing on the I Phone app for what felt like forever she decided she wanted to transition to a game on the 3ds console. Since she had started playing animal crossing new leaf she fell in love with the series. So as her big sister I had decided I would get her this limited edition themed switch in hopes of helping with her depression as well as to cheer her up for her senior year being ruined. Also so she could get a taste of Animal Crossing new horizons for when it comes out March 20th, 2020! The day I told her I purchased it she hopped with joy. I was excited too considering I was sharing my own excitement for animal crossing with my sister. It had finally arrived. Its box didn't come in damaged and the console was packed safely to prevent possible damages. It works perfectly as any nintendo switch should with no defects at all in the console itself. The only concerns I have to remind future buyers is that the joycons will stop working properly after a year of use. This is coming from my own nintendo switch experiences and other fellow switch owners where the controls will drift randomly while you're trying to play a game after a year after consistant use. So I'd be best to invest in a second set of controllers just in case.\n\nAll I have left to say is that this was indeed worth my money and my sister couldn't be happier with her early senior graduation gift!",
                "49": "I couldn't believe my luck when I was able to snag one at MSRP after the release date. It's so cute! I like the design of this one much better than the other switches, and the dock is adorable, especially if you're an Animal Crossing fan. And it's the newer version with improved battery life, too! I was thinking about getting a switch for a while, but the lack of games I absolutely had to have and the colors (I'm not a big fan of the standard colors/designs) put me off. Animal Crossing solved both of these problems with ACNH and this amazing special edition.\n\nMy only complaint (other than how difficult it was to get - finally caught a restock in the middle of the night and even that sold out in less than 5 minutes) is that sometimes one of the joycons gets stuck when trying to remove it from the strap. It's probably just an issue with mine in particular, but it does make it kind of annoying to remove. I have to put some force into it, and I'm sure that one of these days, I'll accidentally scratch myself trying to remove it. Otherwise, it's very cute, and at MSRP, I'd definitely choose it over the other colors!\n\nPS - I hear that this version is restocking, at least in Japan, so absolutely do not buy from scalpers! When I was hunting for this, there were at least 100 being sold by scalpers for ~$500; now there are just over 20 for $750 each. It's cute, but it's not worth making a scalper $400+ off of other people's desperation. Just wait for a restock, or buy a regular switch and put a skin over it.",
                "50": "For any animal crossings fan, you’ll definitely love this switch!",
                "51": "TLDR: Product is SO CUTE!! BUT doesn’t do anything special compared to a regular Switch (other than give 10/10 on aesthetic) so don’t buy unless you can afford it/the look it worth it to you.\n\nLong review:\nThis product is amazing!! The pastel colors are so cute and the texture on the back adds a great extra touch. The dock has an AC graphic on it which was a great addition to\nmy living room! The packaging is also well thought out leading to a great unboxing experience. Of course this works exactly like every other Nintendo switch, so this is entirely about aesthetic.\n\nWith all of that said, the price gouging on this product is insane. Because it is a limited edition the reselling price is crazy, and because it does nothing a normal Switch can’t do, so purchasing this is a novelty. If you have the cash to drop go for it (I was lucky enough to get one at the normal price). But as I was hunting one down when they were first announced, I watched people buy them up and list them at inflated prices before it even came out. So maybe consider if you want to give those people your money.",
                "52": "This is my first switch console. So let me start off by saying the console itself is absolutely beautiful. The design on the back is so pretty and the joycons are gorgeous as well.\nMy biggest issue is not the console itself. But the accessories for it. I’m sure you’ve seen the terrible reviews for the joycons themselves. If you haven’t please check them out. I had done my research on them before hand and ended up buying a different controller just because I was so nervous about using the joycons. The idea is awesome. But they feel so flimsy and cheap. I hadn’t planned to even use the ones that came with the console. I planned to put them away as collectors items. But of course I had to use them to start up the console. As I was holding them I felt the plastic on the back of the right joycon move and make a loud snap. I thought I broke it and I hadn’t even done anything. I was just setting up the console. The colors may look great. But after having that as my first experience I do believe all the reviews I’ve seen for them.\nThe next thing that feels awful is the dock. I had planned to play with the console docked the majority of the time. But just putting the console in makes me cringe because no matter how gentle or slow you are it still hits the sides of the dock when attempt to dock it. There’s only two tiny pieces of soft rubber like material in the dock itself. Which doesn’t protect the console enough. So I ended up buying a screen protector immediately just to give some protection from the dock itself. Just pushing the power button makes the console move and jiggle around in the dock, making it repeatedly hit hard plastic. It doesn’t feel secure whatsoever. The actual part that connects to the switch inside of the dock is very lose as well. The door on the back of the dock also feels cheap. Reminds me of the doors on the Wii. It feels like it could pop off rather easily.\nLet’s move on to the console a little bit. I have used the kickstand. It doesn’t feel super stable and I’d worry if I didn’t have it standing up on a very stable surface. I’d be nervous to have it anywhere near children or accident prone people like me while using it. The screen looks great though. But the hdmi quality of the console menu looks horrible on my monitor. Games seem to look great though, just not the menu/home/settings etc. So I’m not sure if there’s a way to fix that or not. I play other consoles on my monitor and they look beautiful. Another thing, while holding the console with the joycons attached it feels huge. Too big, awkward, and heavy for my tiny hands and I wasn’t even holding it that long. So if you are thinking about getting the switch to playing more mobile and you have tiny hands, maybe consider a switch lite? Unless you want docking and kick stand capabilities which isn’t something the lite can do.\nThe console works great. It’s fast and easy to use and navigate. The buttons feel sturdy as well. I’ve been playing Animal Crossing for hours while docked and the console never gets hot. Just a little warm.\nOverall this console was a cool idea. Just wish they would have put a little more time and money into making some parts a little more sturdy.",
                "53": "Bought it at a great price the only thing I didn't like is the fact that nowhere on the listing did it say it was a Chinese or Japanese model wound up having to buy a new plug for it it did come with an adapter but it sparked every time you plugged it in"

                "1": "I’ve gone through exactly 3 headsets (The official Microsoft Xbox One headset, PlayStation Gold Wireless headset 2018, and a Razor headset) looking for a viable option that had both DECENT audio and mic quality, as all the headsets I’ve purchased have had build quality issues and terrible mic quality. I’ve given up on picking up a wireless headset as from what I’ve seen, are incredibly expensive. I saw the ad for the SteelSeries Arctic 1 headset and it seemed too good to be true (very cheap price for a wireless headset, and interchange between 3 consoles) and to my surprise, it lived up to pretty much all its claims.\n\nWireless connectivity works seamlessly with its included dongle, and I have had zero dropouts or latency issues with it on both PS4 and Nintendo Switch. I originally purchased this headset primarily for the PS4, as I imagined wireless headsets were completely incompatible with the Nintendo Switch, but the headset does in-fact work effortlessly and all the buttons on the headset (Mic Mute On/Off, Volume Dial) work on both systems. Mic quality is excellent as well as audio quality, it’s perfectly balanced and not ridiculously skewed towards bass, and the volume can be raised very high on both consoles if you want. Battery life so far has also been great, it’s something I haven’t had to worry about when using and I only had to charge them once every week out of habit. The headset itself doesn’t feel flimsy and seems decently built, It’s pretty light and is surprisingly comfortable to wear, so much I use it also when I’m on my laptop. The only thing that slightly annoys me is that when I switch playing consoles and want to use the headset on it, I have to get up and unplug the headset dongle and connect it to the console I’m using (say, from the PS4 to the Nintendo Switch). This is pretty much a first world problem, but it’s something I’ve come across every once in a while.\n\nOverall I have to say I’m really loving this headset, if you were on the fence for this thing I really recommend you give it a try.\n\nUPDATE June 2020: It’s been 8 months since I’ve bought this headset, and I just wanted to report back that it has held up ROCK SOLID. This thing is by all means not flimsy, and the battery life has held up incredibly well. I’ve been gaming really long sessions, roughly 5-6 hours long each with friends online, and this thing just keeps going with no issues whatsoever. One of the few purchases I’ve made that I can say was absolutely worth it.\n\nFINAL UPDATE April 2021: Managed to get myself a PS5 and happy to say the headset works flawlessly with it. The new thing I love about the headset now is that the PS5 has a USB-C port in the front, which means you don’t have to use the included cable that comes with the headset dongle for USB-A, you can plug it directly to the PS5 and it sits flush and is almost unnoticeable.",
                "2": "As an average gamer, non-audiophile, and PC user, I bought and used a pair of Astro A20s as my first wireless headset and I regret it deeply. The mic was really sensitive; any sort of breath, head movement, adjusting of the headset, background noise, etc would come through. Not only that, but I would also hear static and crackling noises occasionally. Also, if I would move my head at all, the headset would creak. Very annoying. On multiple occasions, I would find that when I turned on my PC, the dongle would disconnect and require a cycle of pressing the button and restarting the computer until it would connect again. Resorted to permanently leaving my PC on because of this. The directional sound was also non-existent...false advertising.\nI DON'T HAVE ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS WITH THIS NEW HEADSET!!!\nThe sound is amazing; I can hear sounds from all directions and there is no crackling/static. The ear pads are very comfortable; I game on my PC for at least 10 hours per day, and I have yet to experience any soreness or fatigue. Noise cancelling on the mic is excellent. The range is pretty good; I can walk from my room to the downstairs kitchen without the headset disconnecting. The headset is also rhythm game-friendly, as the audio does not lag or desync at all--a problem I experienced with the A20. Battery life seems to be accurate. My only gripe is that I have to download the SteelSeries software to customize the audio, which requires creating an account and giving out my email address.\nOverall, if you are not an audiophile and want a good wireless headset for a budget-friendly price, I highly recommend the Arctis 1. I'm sure any other SteelSeries model is great; my sister has the Arctis 7 and loves it. I settled with this one because it was the cheapest I could find (and less expensive than the A20).",
                "3": "Okay let me start off and say that this headset is TREMENDOUSLY GOOD. I been using Astros for years and i kinda got burnt out on it & i wanted to try something new and then i came across Steelseries Arctis 1 Wireless. I’ve heard about Steelseries for quite sometime but never really bothered getting a headset until now.\n\nComfort 10/10 : Let me honestly say that this is the most comfortable headset i have ever wore in my entire life. I’ve been through Astro A40s, Astro A50s, Turtle Beach ( I don’t recommend btw ) , Somy headsets and this took me by surprise. For a $100!? It’s honestly amazing. The clamping force is really not bad. Doesn’t hurt your ears or anything when putting them on. Also the very soft leather material they use on the Ear Cups is the best i have felt.\n\nDurability 10/10 : Now you may think it looks like a very cheap plastic. I’m gonna let you know that it’s not. They use a very strong plastic & what makes this even better is the very strong reinforced steel they use on the headband which makes it very durable and flexible. This doesn’t mean you can just throw your headset because it’s that durable. As every other gaming headset just take them off gently and place them down gently to avoid any damage. Overall you don’t have to worry about this breaking on you unlike that cheap plastic that Turtle Beach use. If i can compare to another headset in terms of durability it would be Astros. It’s that good.\n\nSound 10/10 : Boy oh Boy let me just say. When i first hooked these up i was SHOCKINGLY stunned how loud these were. It was to the point i legit had to turn them down a notch because it was that loud. You definitely get your bass, Low, Mids & Highs. You have very good directional sounds so you can hear enemy footsteps from behind, front, ledt & right perfectly well and you can also tell weather they’re up top or at the bottom. Overall the Sound Quality is top tier so don’t listen to the reviews of ppl saying it’s bad\n\nNoise Cancellation 10/10 : Steelseries definitely nailed it on this one. When you put this on you cam barely hear anything in the background. There was times i had to take these off to actually hear what they’re saying. Probably one of the best i seen if you ask me.\n\nMic Monitoring 10/10 : Now let me get this straight. Ppl said the mic was terrible but they’re wrong . Let me tell you that this Mic sounds very crisp and clear. As far as i stated before with the noise cancellation ppl can barely hear anything in your background with this mic. So if you got a PS4 that sounds like an AC130 taking off this will cover it 100% and i also love the fact it’s w Clearcast mic which is why it’s even better. You can also use the Steelseries EQ Engine to adjust any of these features above to your liking weather you wanna tweak the sounds or the mic etc so that’s a W for Steelseries.\n\nOverall Review : These are definitely worth $100. I recommend anyone to get this if you’re struggling to get a good headset especially the more expensive premium ones. Although this headset does feel very premium if you ask me. You won’t be disappointed with this product at all. By far my new favorite headset along with Astros.",
                "4": "I've always been pleased with Steel Series headphones and the Arctis 1 wireless is another great example of why I continue to buy their products.\n\nThe feel and fitment on the head is very good. After 4-6 hours, there's no discomfort. Lots of room in the ear cups with a good amount of padding.\nI use mine for gaming on the ps5. The battery life seems to be close enough to what they advertise. First time use was as simple as plugging the included dongle into the front of the ps5 and turning on the headphones. The sound quality is good and very well balanced. It's loud enough that I normally turn it down to around 60-70% volume. Didn't distort at max volume as well. It comes with 3 cables: A micro usb, usb-c to usb extension for the included dongle, and a 3.5 mm audio cable for headphone jacks.\nCons:\n-The micro usb charging port is very inconvenient and outdated.\n-The ear cups are fabric and will be harder to clean.\n-To turn the headphones on and off require you to press and hold the power button for several seconds each time. A simple switch would have been better.\n-The overall style and design is kinda dull and nothing to write home about.\nOverall, I'm satisfied with these headphones. If you want a no nonsense pair of headphones that are reliable and get the job done, these are worth considering.",
                "5": "So firstly the cons:\n- the microphone quality is just above 2002 YouTube video quality. Its okay.\n- the microphone's \"noise cancelling\" is also okay.\n- the microphone does not noise cancel when things brush the microphone so do bear that in mind.\n- the headsets range is about 40? Feet.\n- the headset creeks and sounds like it's on the verge of breaking constantly and feels cheap\n\nPros!\n- easy to setup and get working\n- easy to use their basic app to setup an EQ\n- once eq'd it sounds lovely\n- ear pads are pretty much universal\n- despite its creeking and cheap feel, it's tough as an ox\n- it's 70ish dollars\n- a better headset is significantly more than 70 dollars\n- better headsets than are wireless break significantly easier and are not 70 dollars\n- keeps out enough noise to ignore your surroundings but not enough that you can't hear what's going on",
                "6": "I usually dont bother writing reviews, but this headset is so perfect that i just had to. I cant believe how well they fit, how comfortable they are right out of the box, and how amazing they sound. The crispness of the audio is evident right away. I have gone through many headsets. I had the X41 Turtle beaches, the stealth 600 gen 1 and gen 2 as well as other foreign gaming headsets that were supposedly great, and these blow all of them away in every category. They look great, the head band part is flexible so it wont break, the comfort is 10 our of 10, and most importantly the sound is so clear and you can always tell exactly what direction an enemy is coming from in shooter games. Another thing that i love about this headset is the wireless dongle they use. Instead of a USB, its a dongle that fits the Playstation, my computer, my laptop, and my Android phone. It just works the way its supposed to on every device. Also, the microphone is detachable too so you dont need to have it on all the time if you dont want to. They thought of everything with these headsets. And the battery lasts a long time as well. I will never buy another type of wireless gaming headset other than this. I believe it will last for years to come but that remains to be seen. You cant go wrong with these. 10 out of 10 overall from me.",
                "7": "Disclaimer: While I am a big headphones enthusiasts (have tried/owned many different pairs), this only my second gaming headset, as I have usually played video games through speakers. I previously had a cheap Turtle Beach set that I used for PS4 multiplayer games with friends and family. Since building a new gaming PC 4 months ago, I've been using headphones for gaming more often. I've also had to use headphones for work since my job has moved to WFH for the foreseeable future. My favorite cans are currently my modded Koss Pro DJ100 w/ a good amp (closed set) and the Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro (open set) which I also use for mixing/editing audio tracks. I bought these because I needed a wireless set for couch gaming when I run my PC into my TV.\n\nComfort & Looks: Arctis 1 = 4/5; Arctis 7 = 4.5/5\nThe plastic finish and plain look are OK but not amazing. For $100 dollars the look and feel is totally serviceable. There are some rough-ish edges on the headband, but everything else is smooth. The clamping force is a little tight for me personally, but it's comfortable otherwise (not too hot, headband rests OK, can move around just fine, etc). My partner has a smaller head than me and they love the Arctis 1 so far with no complaints (it is now their main headphone for working and gaming). The Arctis 7 is excellent for me and the headband is very comfy. The clamping pressure is less but still allows for movement without falling off my head. I like the slightly cleaner look & feel of the 7, but the 1 is sturdy in its own right (if just a little rough).\n\nSound: Arctis 1 = 4/5; Arctis 7 = 4.5/5\nThe sound on the Arctis 1 is quite good for a $100 wireless set (although not an audiophile set exactly). Definitely a mainstream gaming EQ curve (extra bass, slightly scooped mid). The details are fine and the soundstage works well with stereo effects in music or games (like enemies clunking around in FPS games). There's OK high extension but they're slightly attenuated. Mids are generally accurate but there seems to be more prominent low and high mids honestly. After EQing in the provided software I was able to quickly set up a couple profiles (gaming and music) that sounded good to me for general gaming and listening. The Arctis 7 isn't incredibly different although I feel it's a little more balanced and has better isolation. The soundstage also feels a little more realistic to me personally and it feels just a little more detailed. The surround sound is OK, but I'm honestly fine with stereo imaging.\n\nMic/Communication Functions: Arctis 1 = 3.5/5;Arctis 7 4/5\nThe mic is decent (same microphone on both), but it has that constant compression and low dynamic range thing going on. It's perfectly serviceable for communicating in games (and work meetings, Zoom calls, etc.), but don't try to record vocals with it or anything like that. I've been using it to teach and my students say it sounds fine compared to my usual SM58 or AT2020 setup.I should note that the Arctis 7 has game chat mix in case you want to mix the level of chat mixed into your game. It's a nice feature if you play games where chat is useful. I also love that the mic on the Arctis 7 can be pushed back up into the ear cup.\n\nConnectivity & Battery: Arctis 1 =4.5/5; Arctis 7 = 3.5/5\nGreat connectivity options on the Arctis 1, especially the USB-C dongle. So easy to switch between devices (including my phone) on the fly. The Arctis 7 has a traditional USB dongle with line in/line out 1/8' jacks. It's fine but less useful than the Arctis 1 dongle for me. The battery life is great on both and they charge back up pretty quickly as well.\n\nTLDR: Arctis 1 has higher clamping force, better overall connectivity, and it's rougher around the edges. The Arctis 7 is comfy, better built, and has better isolation and a tuck-away mic. I think the Arctis 7 sounds just slightly better, but they're both nice wireless headphones in their own right. If you have a small to average head and want to save $50, the Arctis 1 is great. If you want more polish, have a larger head, or want slightly better communications functionality, grab the Arctis 7.",
                "8": "I have been using this headset for a little over a week and would like to share my experience so far.\n\nPros:\n-The sound quality is great\n-The over ear design is comfortable\n-The 'on headset' controls are very useful (volume control, mute/unmute microphone toggle)\n-The microphone voice clarity is great\n-I love that the microphone can be taken off when not in use so its not always in the way\n-The 2.4ghz dongle is USB-C but the headset does come with a USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter. So i can use it with anything.\n-The wireless range is great\n-Zero audio latency is amazing\n-Long battery life\n-Works on all of my devices (most importantly my xbox since there are ZERO wireless headsets for xbox one for some reason)\n\nNow, with all of those great things about it that i have never seen another headset match, there are a few things about this headset that i found to be surprising problems in a headset that is so highly rated, loved, and priced.\nAnd i do understand that some of the issues that i have with it are going to be very specific to me, and few people that struggle with the same unique traits that i do.\n\nCons:\n-Low build quality in something that has a premium price.\nWhen i pay $100 for a headset i expect it to be top of the line in the materials used to make it. But instead it is made out of very cheap feeling plastic that is very easy to break/bend. This makes the headset feel extremely ridged and like you constantly have to be careful with it. And i dont like having to worry about that when paying so much for it. When i pay a premium price, i should feel like i am holding a premium item.\n-HEADACHES.\nThis is one will will probably be pretty specific to me because i am VERY prone to headaches. But to put it plainly, the headset is so NON ADJUSTABLE that it squeezes my head VERY TIGHT in just the wrong way to cause me to get a lot of tension headaches. Not what i want in a headset that i intend to be wearing for 6+ hours a day. I have tried to pull on the headband portion to make it sit a little wider on my head in an effort to make it so its not squeezing my head so tightly but thats another situation where the poor build quality comes into play. When i try to pull on it the shell is so ridged that it cant change shape at all. it just starts to bend in a way that makes the cushion on top of your head pop out and starts to look like your about to do some permanent damage to the headset. So i am forced to deal with the headset squeezing my head a lot tighter than i would prefer.\n-Its very heavy.\nIve used a lot of different headsets in my life and im sure its partly because of the added weight from the battery.\nBut regardless of that when i have the headset on, i feel like my head is significantly weighed down. Even when compared to other wireless headsets ive used. This also doesnt positively effect my headaches.\n-I have to hold the power button for a frustratingly long time to either turn it on or off but most importantly to wake it up when it puts itself into sleep mode.\nSomething as simple as a toggle switch instead of a press and hold button would completely fix this issue. Not sure whether its just straight up turning itself off when inactive for a few min or if its goes into some kind of sleep mode, either way it is surprising how much it bothers me to do things like leave my desk for 5 min and have to hold the power button down for 5+ seconds before i can hear anything again. This wouldnt annoy me as much if i didnt have to do it so often, Im working from home and helping my wife with our newborn baby so i have to pause things and be away from my desk for a few min quite frequently throughout the day. This results in me spending a cumulative 5+ min of my day just holding the power button on my headset which can get pretty annoying.\n-Not made for people with smaller heads.\nThis is a large headset. Not the ear pieces themselves necessarily, its the head band thats the issue. At its smallest setting, it barely fits my head, and thats if i learn to ignore it still sitting on the top of my ears. Dont know if its just my short forehead or if its my big ears, probably a combination of both, either way as a full grown adult i should have to extend the headband portion ever so slightly, not have to deal with it being to big at its smallest setting. I used headsets like this when i was playing games at the age of 12 when my head was a lot smaller. And most pro gamers now days ARE younger, how is this headset supposed to cater to them when it doesnt fit the head of an adult?\n\nAll in all, It is a very good headset. And if you have no problems with headaches, have a larger head, and are able to be very careful with the headset and dont have any kids around it EVER, then this headset will serve all of your needs and more extremely well.\nPersonally i still have a few weeks before i reach the return deadline so i am going to see if i can just get used to the issues that i have with it or adapt to them. Its a good and unique enough headset that i feel as though i will struggle to find another one that can do everything that i love about this headset.\nSo i will give it a couple more weeks and update this review as to whether the issues i have with it can be overcome.",
                "9": "I've owned this headset for about a year now. I'm not a pro gamer, I'm no tech wiz, just a casual.\n\nPros:\nThe sound quality is quite good.\nThe versatility of use is great. Getting to move the plug in to so many different devices is quite handy.\n\nMid:\nThe range. It has maybe a 10' range. I have an open concept house, and when I get up to get a drink or something with my headset, inevitably I start hearing these annoying beeps warning me that I'm put of range.\n\nCons:\nThe microphone. It's one of the worst audio captures I've ever heard. Whether I'd have the mic a few inches away, right against my mouth, or anywhere in between, it always sounded like I was 30' away from the thing. It sounded like the only thing it was trying to capture was the room tone. Just awful.\n\nI'm very torn on whether I'd buy another SteelSeries headset.",
                "10": "Like I said, I'm definitely no expert in headphones but I did a little bit of research before I bought these in the good ol 2023 and it seems like they still held up pretty well in comparison to other headphones.\n\nSo I really like these. The mobility of wireless headphones is really nice, and they're not uncomfortable. My previous headphones had been a pair of craply Beats and in comparison I enjoy the audio from these a lot better and I am able to pick up more audio details in things like Valorant.\n\nI really enjoy the volume wheel on the headphones as a streamer. Sometimes I need to crank audio too loud for my sensitive ears and with my old headphones I was struggling between my auditory comfort and making sure things are audible and balanced in stream.\n\nMy only issue is that I legitimately have no idea how loud I'm talking with these on and that the low battery beep stresses me out, lol."

The Fortnite and Rocket League bonuses it came with were lovely as well, and my only issue is one everyone has, which is storage. A storage card or simply playing games on cloud can remedy this easily.\n\nI own a 4K TV, and the games always look and run flawless, as well as streaming movies and tv shows from platforms such as max, paramount plus, or hell, even tubi. if you're looking for a console to start with that isn't too pricey, and can be used for other things, I really do recommend this. The lack of disc drive has never really bothered me, as I personally don't have too much storage for all the discs anyway, and the money not spent for one instead went to adding more games out of the box.\n\nGame Pass Ultimate is also absolutely worth your money, as it comes with EA Play, and perks that sometimes even include other memberships, like peacock or apple tv, or recently, crunchyroll!\n\nAll in All, i'm definitely a devoted Xbox player as a result of this, and intend to stick by these consoles as my primary, for price and performance in the future.",

I'm gaming like 6 hrs in a week tops, just wanted something to be effortless and chill. This... delivered.

I bought for myself so the box condition wasn't an issue. The codes for Fortnite and Rocket League were unused. The games load so fast now! Happy with my purchase!\n\nPlease Note: I brought over my external 2 TB hard drive I was using on my Xbox One S for storage. I have found that the newer Xbox Series X-S games will not install on the external hard drive due to the connection speed between the USB attached hard drive is not fast enough (the Xbox will flash a notification that you won't be able to play the game). With the Series S only having 512 GB of internal storage, I have already run out of space on my internal storage as I play mainly Grand Theft Auto V, Fallout 76, and Conan Exiles. So I will have to buy the Seagate Storage Expansion Card which will be another $150 plus. This is not a deal breaker, but I wanted to share.",
                "8": "Because it's so small (can literally hold it with one hand if your hand is big enough) it's more prone to heating up and dropping frames in certain games, so place it somewhere open. It only has 300 GB of storage, so it'll run out of space after a few games, but you can get yourself a $20 extended storage for 1TB and that's no longer an issue. So far, it's been doing it's job well, and my bf has no complaints.",
                "9": "Honestly, i think the Series S is a superb/great console.\n\nOnly two cons, cost of external plug-in drive to overcome seriously ludicrous limited memory capacity (no excuse for not having 1TB in S and 2TB in X in modern day) AND its gameplay speed (Series S n Series X) is really not THAT much better than xbox one x.\n\nAside from faster load times, I really dont see a major difference in performance in series s and an ssd equipped one x. Xbox series x is also not all that without 4k tv n, even with the fancy new tv, its really not that super-impressive. If i had it to do over again, aside from the series x as a surprise gift, i’d have been happy with the Series S and 1tb plug-in drive. Seagate, i think?\n\nBUT, aside from moderately faster load times, without games written specifically for these 2 new console iterations, just put an ssd in your xbox one x and keep running it until you HAVE to change up. Maybe the plug in ssd will be more affordable then and id say do that with a series s n enjoy it.\n\nTo do it again? Id just keep jamming w my one x with high speed ssd. Unfortunately, im prolly giving mine to one of my Destiny clanmates who seriously needs a new console. He sherpas lfg alot of people (looking for game) through raids (like me n i super suck) so its a good cause.\n\nI'm on an xbox series x which i got from my sister as a surprise gift. Between series S and X? I’d go with Series S and 1tb expansion card n give my one x to my clanmate. Save the stress n cash n skip the Series X. Use that cash to get a 20th Anniversary or Series 2 Elite Controller to go with your new sweet Series S. Or, put it towards the memory expansion card.\n\nSince I've played all 3 n switched back n forth over the last month, i thought I’d share my wisdom. Good luck with your decision n remember, as always, ymmv.",

I was so excited to get this in and upon opening it found that the box has already been through some crap. With a slice up the front of the box (which as you can see wouldn't happen from me opening my amazon box from the placement and direction) along with dings everywhere and rips on the top front and bottom back of the box. I'm already very disappointed as I purchased a NEW PRODUCT not a renewed, not a used anything but A NEW XBOX. That being said I will wait until my partner comes home so he can test it and see if it still works properly. But this little boy deserves the joy of seeing a brand new untouched box that he gets to open up Christmas morning! Not a messed up box that looks like it was dropped at every turn. That being said I'll update once we test it and make sure they didn't sell me a broken product and if it does work obviously it'll get 4 stars. Just wish I hadn't been the exception to the rule and gotten one of the messed up ones...\n\nUPDATE:\nWe've tested it and it does work!!! So thankfully it was just the box that was all messed up!! We decided we won't give it to him in its original packaging as it looks horrible but so long as it works that all that matters!",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "So, to start out with, I purchased this pair because my PlayStation platinum headset broke completely. I mean, like the ear pieces were falling off after having it for nearly five years.\n\nThe g432 are actually really comfortable. I have a really small head and have to have it the tightest it can go for it to sit correctly on it. This causes strain on my head and I’d be sore for an hour or so after I take them off and not to mention the headaches. This pair gives me no such problem. Perfect for my small head.\n\nNow onto sound. The sounds is okay at best. With some free audio extensions, it sounds a whole lot better. I mostly play ffxiv and am a sucker for the music. So the free audio extensions you can find online are great. On some of the games where the static kicks in, it’s because of certain audio stereos in the ghub server need to be turned off. It was one of the left ones cause it kept making a buzzing noise but with only certain games.\n\nFor the mic, I really like the fact that when I’m eating I can just flip it up. (Or my cat can do it when she’s insisting on head butting me in the face when she starts her constant neediness.) but the mic also for the price sounds great. First time I got it my friends on discord all stated they could finally hear me and what I’m saying. Highly needed for end content raids/dungeons for destiny 2 as well as ffxiv.\n\nWould I pay 30-40 bucks for the same pair again? Absolutely. I’ve had these for almost two years and not a single breakage on the plastic parts, but the cushion for the top of the head piece has worn down a little over time. Which I can’t complain about because I use my computer almost daily and to say that is the only thing that has had wear and tear is remarkable.\n\nThanks for reading my review.",
                "2": "Wow, what can I say other then for 40 bucks These are pretty nice everything from the sound quality which sounds really nice and clear has a good amount of a bass not overpowering on that end and you can hear footsteps nice and loud and other little things in the game that you normally wouldn’t pick up without a headset on really impressed with the sound quality. Something else I really enjoy is the comfort they seem pretty comfortable. I have very sensitive ears and these seem to work very well and tight on the head not too overpowering and plenty of space for my ears which is always the problem I have with headsets my right ear gives me trouble and these fit perfect. They kind of have that square shaped design like the Astros, which is what I previously owned and absolutely loved. The Mic as well sounds really clear which is a plus. I currently use this on my PS5 and they’re easy they just plug right into the Duelsense controller. The only drawback I would say is the cord seems to be a little cheap and it’s pretty long, but a little zip tie or something will help with that and the overall plastic around the headband seems like it can break pretty easily so that’s some thing to watch out for but other than that for $40 you can’t really go wrong with these. I currently have a pair of razor black shark V 2 that are wireless, so in between that time of charging these are what I use and for one I can say these things sound just as good as the razor headset and those cost me 130 bucks. So for the money you can’t beat it if you got the 40 bucks I would say jump on these logitechs you won’t be disappointed.",
                "3": "TL;DR- Headphones good. Better sound. More comfort. Minus one star for lack of headphone/mic control on wire (that's a personal preference though). A great buy, if you don't mind being tethered.\n\nFull write-up, AKA \"may-as-well-be-a-blog-post\":\nI'd been using the Logitech G430 headset (discontinued) for the past 9 years or so, until the 2nd one I owned started giving out. This headset is, in many ways, the same device as the Logitech G430. The only difference is the ear cup padding, the absence of volume/headphone controls on the wire, and the wire itself being a rubber-coated wire like any other USB device (rather than the striking blue woven wire sheathing of the G430) that is a bit shorter than the G430's as well. Shorter wire is a good thing- the 430 was overkill with 10 feet of cord, while the 432 is just about right for most setups at 6 feet.\n\nThe absence of the cloth ear cushions and blue sheathing on the wire means this shouldn't get quite as dirty or dull as quickly, and it'll be easier to clean if it does. The new cushions are a little stiffer, which means that the headset will feel tighter at first than a G430. After a few days, you don't notice.\n\nSound quality is slightly better than the G430 as the new ear cup cushions has better noise-cancelling qualities than the old woven ones AND the surround sound channels (which need to be activated through the G-HUB program that Logitech loves to use for every device they make) have been slightly reworked for a more spatially precise audio experience.",
                "4": "I have had these for over two years now and really can't complain about much. I play video games and stream with them and have gotten comments on how nice and clear my mic is.\n\nAudio: I think the audio is pretty standard. Not the best you'll ever hear in life but in this price range it's amazing. I've been jump scared a few times not being able to hear someone come up to my desk so the noise cancelling is pretty decent.\n\nMic: I thought that maybe I needed to upgrade my mic but I haven't found anything aside upgrading to an external mic that tops this. I love the flip to mute ability and use it frequently.\n\nComfort: I usually start to feel the tiniest discomfort after about 5-6 hours which is plenty time for me most of the time. I have worn them longer and it's not painful but just a little sore when I take them off. They are on the lighter side and adjust nicely.\n\nLongevity: There's some slight wear on the headband part but that just started after all this time and they do rest on a holder in that spot. I did have some issues with sound stopping out of one earphone at one point, I think something became loose and so I just have to keep the volume scroll wheel on the actual headset in a certain spot now but it's not a problem because I never used that to control the volume anyway. It hasn't stopped working in a few months now. I haven't seen anyone else have this issue when it started so could just be a rare occasion and of course eventually they'll need to be replaced. For this price though I'd buy the same ones again and be set for a few more years at least.\n\nComparison: I saw some HyperX Cloud Alpha S on sale and bought them thinking I was getting an upgrade and I was so wrong. The HyperX mic quality was so quiet I thought maybe it was just me but saw others posting online having the same issues. So far I haven't been able to fix it enough and in order to stream and not annoy talking with friends in Discord I'll be returning to using my Logitech headset for the foreseeable future. The HyperX was also much heavier and started to cause discomfort much sooner, maybe about two hours.\n\nOverall: Despite some minor issues these headphones have done really well for me and are better than other headsets I've tried that may be similarly priced. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a new gaming headset.",
                "5": "Logitech is normally a very reliable company when it comes to its electronics, and I’m glad I can say the same about this headset. While the list price is $80, I haven’t seen it priced above $40, which is what I got both of my headsets at (my first one broke, completely my fault!).\n\nComfort wise, the cups have a bit of a particular shape but I don’t see why they shouldn’t fit all head and ear shapes. They’re comfortable and my ears don’t sweat!\n\nAll of the features work fine on it, too. The volume slider is a bit to get used to since I’m so used to just adjusting the volume on my machine, but it works just fine. The mic isn’t recording studio quality but it’s perfect for gaming with friends over voice chat. The mute feature works great, too, but every time I put the mic up there’s a dull sound the mic picks up when I actuate mute mode. Nothing major.\n\nSound quality is good depending on what you’re using it for. For gaming and movies, it’s great! But just listening to music isn’t as good as using my first gen AirPods. Still, overall sound quality is more than just good enough.\n\nOverall, it’s a great product. I don’t doubt there are better headsets out there, but this one is phenomenal on a tight budget. Highly recommend!",
                "6": "I got these back in July 6, 2021.\nPros: For the price they are ok, they have a nice noise cancelling foam (as many gaming headsets have) they're comfortable to wear for hours of gaming. I really like the volume wheel on the left side of the headset, I can easily lower or raise the volume of what i'm listening to.\n\nCons: The microphone picks up noise from my room or even traffic going by and can be a tad bit annoying when in voice chat with friends or strangers in games. The microphone also isn't a flexible wire (which i was hoping it was), so I am unable to bend closer to my mouth or away. It can only go up and down. The cord is also an aux cord, I was hoping to have a usb or like most headsets have both, but that's my personal preference. The biggest NEGATIVE about this is both sides of my headset are broken now. The plastic is real cheap and it somehow cracked opened.. So both my headset pieces just dangle now. I had to use tape to put it back in place. They only lasted me 1 year before they cracked open.\n\nConclusion: I won't be getting these again.. they broke in a year if not less. The microphone isn't great and the cord is an Aux cord.",
                "7": "When split to controller and PC 3.5 mm jack the mic only registers at 20% volume when screaming as loud as i can.. when connected to PC via the usb dongle mic is better but not great in volume. ear cups are good and fit over my ears if I angle the head rest to the back. they sound great and the volume knob is convenient\nthe mic is clear and no complaints from any body I've gamed with on the XBOX and although very low it is still clear when recoding to PC. The ANC is good I live on the side of a busy freeway and no one has been able to hear the Semi trucks go by that is better than most sub $50 headsets.\nCAUTION: The fake leather/rubber padding is not good if you are bald and will crack with extended use from oils and moisture from head I have knitted headphone cozies already because ALL headphones are uncomfortable to bald heads after a short while.\nthe pc volume of the mic keeps this from being the Perfect sub $50 headset, but still one of the best.\nP.S. Biggest CON is that the 7.1 only works on PC through the usb dongle with the Logitech software running! the Bass is PAR for headphones so I use the surround system for movies and PC content anyway, but the sound direction seems to be hit or miss with the headphones not giving very accurate placement to sound\nStill one could definitely do worse for more money",
                "8": "Pros:\n1) It's $10 cheaper than where I originally found it online.\n2) It's wired, so I don't have to worry about batteries needing to be recharged.\n3) It's comfortable to wear. I'm a big guy, so having a headset that doesn't squeeze my head while using it helps.\n\nCons:\n1) To use this properly, you need to download the, \"Logitech G Hub,\" software from the Logitech website. I was having trouble getting the headset to work properly, and thought it just needed a driver update. That's what I thought I was downloading from their website, and got the app instead. I don't need something taking up more hard drive (or SSD) space.\n\n2) Testing the sound, it doesn't work as it should. Sound comes across as 5.0 or 5.1 instead of the 7.1 surround sound it's supposed to be. The G Hub app has a surround sound test I was able to use. The, \"left,\" \"left rear surround,\" and \"left surround,\" channels were all the same speaker. The same with the, \"right,\" \"right surround,\" and \"right rear surround,\" channels. The way the test is designed, a slight difference on the right side was less difficult to detect. By slight, I mean close to zero difference between the three channels on each side.\n\nI tried it with several games. Destiny 2, Call of Duty, Resident Evil Village (aka Resident Evil 8, and RE8), and A Plague Tale: Requiem, are the first games I tried. The first 2, sound was lackluster and had some spatial distortion. RE8 needed some extra tweaking in the game settings. With some research, Requiem required a sound setting in the operating system modified. The headset went from not plug-n-play, to less-than plug-n-play. If I have to do technical acrobatics to get moderate surround sound and sub-par sound for other games – not to mention movies and other forms of entertainment – then this will be the last Logitech headset I get.\n\n3) I was talking to Logitech customer service online, and she confirmed the 3.5mm-to-USB converter (she called it a USB DAC) is needed for the device to work as a true 7.1 surround sound. Even while using it and the Logitech G Hub, it still wasn't giving me 7.1 surround sound.\n\n4) The headphones do NOT work with every game. I tried it with Resident Evil VII.I.age, and sound was almost none existent, and choppy extremely low when it did exist.\n\n5) The sound was off. I have a Bluetooth headset by another company that sounds much better. Recording games, then playing them back, the sound is even worse.\n\nI would NOT recommend this headset. It's a shame, because I've never had problems with other Logitech equipment I've used, and would like to stick with them. I guess their name on headsets (or at least this one) doesn't mean much.\n\n(edited)",

                "2": "I was hesitant to buy this cause of the price. I don’t regret it one bit. I have this and the dualsense edge both great controllers. Lots of options with joysticks whatever feels comfortable to you. Great for gaming. No complaints.",
                "3": "Easy Bluetooth connection to Windows gaming PC and to XBox. Used connected via USB-C and wirelessly with zero lag or communication problems.\nNot really a whole lot of use for all four backside triggers. Nice to know I can use them if needed.\nController feels very nice in the hand and stays comfortable after long sessions.\nQuickly replaceable dpad and thumb sticks are convenient. Magnetically attached, can fall off if dropped, no issues during pretty aggressive gameplay though.",
                "4": "For a “refurbished” unit this arrived in perfect condition.\n\nI was aware that there could be issues with this.\n\nI was very surprised to find it arrived in a factory sealed box. Opening it up I found no dents or blemishes, nothing is cracked or missing. Took just a couple hours to charge it. Everything works exactly as it should.\n\nI’m very happy with my purchase. Thank you!",
                "5": "I bought this as a controller for my pc and I feel like I got scammed. It worked great for the first few months, loved the customization, it had a little stick drift but nothing that I would call awful. Well about 2 months ago (literally as soon as it was out of the return window) the B button started to get a crunchy, grindy feeling. It felt like the finish on the body of the controller had worn away, but I saw online that these have a tendency to accumulate grease and dirt, so I went to troubleshoot. Turns out I was right and no amount of cleaning took care of the issue, the B button still grinds. Keep in mind I don't eat while playing games and generally wash my hands about 50 times a day because I have a baby bladder and wash my hands every time I go to the bathroom.\n\nNow however it's gone past annoying into totally broken. The right button simply does not work half the time unless pressed very hard. I tried updating the controller, messing with steam configs etc etc. It's the physical button itself and since I don't mash buttons in and and not heavy handed it just feels like dropped inputs. I don't throw my controllers, I don't eat with them, you would think it was brand new looking at it (other than some oil from my hands, which this controller displays worse than any other I've ever owned), the buttons simply failed on their own in less than a year AS SOON AS I was out of the warranty window.\n\nDon't buy this. Either get a playsation controller, the basic xbox controller or whatever other pc controller you can. Microsoft support is godawful too and this is NOT worth the money it costs. The customization is nice but if the controller doesn't work it's all marketing trash",

Even if you just lightly press forward and the stick recenters you keep moving. I looked up this issue and it seems Microsoft has been aware of this issue for years and does nothing to fix it. Instead wanting to charge you $100 to send it to them to be fixed. Microsoft even released an article admitting they know of the issue and yet years later they still have done nothing.\n\nThe fix they put out is to increase the dead zone. But others report they have to increase the dead zone so much it makes the controller less responsive to things like turning around and makes games unplayable. The only other solution was to replace it if under warranty or send it to be fixed for another $100. Or you can void the warranty open the controller yourself and supposedly air compress clean the sensor area. Though that is no guarantee. It is pathetic that a multibillion-dollar international company is going to charge $200 for a supposed elite controller that they know has issues and does nothing about it.\n\nOn top of that, the controller has two switches on the back that have little rubber covers on them that come off and are easy to lose. They are so small it is difficult to put them back on despite how easily they will come off.\n\nThey also do not provide instructions on how to customize the extra buttons or set the different configs. You have to dig online for the answers. Then wade your way through their website just to find the app to configure it. Again for $200 for a CONTROLLER they should make it so much easier. When you plug the controller in with USB it should automatically ask if you want to install the app if it is not installed.\n\nI only bought this controller instead of the New Sony Professional controller because the controller is compatible with Windows and has driver support. Sony still refuses to add driver support on a PC for their controllers. You can still use their controller but you lose a lot of the functions and features. So it would just be an expensive base controller. Sony has their own issues mainly with their analog sticks wearing out. That is why their new controller has the ability to swap out the entire analog stick for a new one, even though it is $20 for a new one. I had a PS5 controller(not the professional) and used it on PC, as I said though you lose features. But it worked fine as a base controller until the analog stick wore out. It is not worth sending it in to be repaired. This is why I ended up buying this Elite controller to actually have all the functions. But Microsoft is fully aware that their controller has issues and is offering a subpar product.\n\nI do not recommend buying Sony or Microsoft, controllers. You are probably better off getting an off-brand controller that will offer the same functionality at a lower cost and likely better quality.",

This will probably cause them to break eventually. But I guess you get what you pay for at this low price. I would've thought, since they are an \"officially licensed product\" for Playstation, that they would have been better designed. It too bad because they work great. Good sound quality.\n\nUPDATE: Really really BAD design. If you wear glasses... these are NOT the headphones for you. The ear cushions should fit around the ears, but these sit ON the ears. So after an hour or two of gaming your ears have been crushed into the arms of your glasses and your skull.\nThese headphones are etter suited to be advertised for young children, like single digit aged kids, due to the small size of the ear cushions. Again, horribly designed.\n\nChanged my rating from 3 starts to 1.\n\nUPDATE 2: It's been just over a week since I got these and I've stopped using them.

The games look much better in handheld mode, its amazing, you have to see it for yourself. However if you are only a Docked mode player this upgrade is not for you since it runs the games the same as the original Switch. Also a plus to the OLED model is the double storage size from 32 GB to 64 GB and the included ethernet port for more stable online play on games. This Zelda TOTK special edition is gorgeous!!!, a perfect gift for family or friends that love the Switch in handheld mode or as a first Switch, they are going to love it.",

The definitive switch experience: screen, sound and a little more of internal space, a more visually appealing dock and the colors and polishing of the design are amazing for a gaming/Zelda fan.

From the moment I received this console, I was blown away by its beautiful design, featuring intricate details and a gorgeous color scheme that pays homage to one of the greatest games in the series.\n\nBut it's not just the console's exterior that impresses me; the OLED screen is simply stunning, with vibrant colors and crystal-clear graphics that bring my favorite games to life in a way that I never thought possible. And with its improved battery life and enhanced audio, I can immerse myself in the world of Hyrule for hours on end without any distractions.\n\nOverall, the OLED Model - The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Edition is truly a collector's item that any die-hard Zelda fan would be proud to own. It has reignited my passion for this beloved franchise and brought back cherished memories of my childhood spent exploring the lands of Hyrule. I would highly recommend this console to anyone who shares my love for Zelda and wants to experience the series in a whole new way.",

Overall it's great!\n\nHowever, the joycons have been bothering me since the moment I took them out of the box. Both of the joycons' thumbsticks have a problem with their internal springs that cause them to produce very loud metal spring noises when being used. It's very annoying to be playing a game and constantly hear twings and twangs from the springs that's louder than even the game audio.\n\nIt made me stop playing in hand held mode until I eventually read online that you can minimize some of the noise by using electronics cleaner. So I bought a can, sprayed a little into the gap beneath the thumbsticks protective center cover, moved the stick in circles for a few minutes, and then let it dry. Boom, almost no spring noise. Almost. It's still there, but much, much quieter, and I'm back to playing handheld!",
                "10": "I been loving the switch since I got it, a lot of fun and helps with stress, I haven’t had any problems other than my off brand sd card that I bought and didn’t wanna work after a while, I just fix it buying a licensed Nintendo sd card, but imma say that if you buy this switch on Amazon it might be shipped my ups and they don’t like going tonto apartment to you would have to go to and up picking up the console somewhere, and just for that I’ll say just go and buy it at a game stop or target that has it on stuck, it’s the same thing, you have guarantee too, and it’s faster to start playing , really good purchase and nice design overall, a lil bit bad that it does not come with the game tho."

                "1": "In a nutshell these are Metal Gear Solids 1,2,&3 ported to the PS5(2 &3 are the HD Collection versions). They aren't remasters nor did Konami market them as such. That is the big reason I disagree with some of the grief this collection gets on YouTube. They look and play the same way they did when they originally were released. In my opinion that is a good thing. Look at the issues that with the Grand Theft Auto remasters. If I had to pick a negative it is that you can't pause the cut scenes in MGS 2 or 3. Considering how long some are this feature should have been added. If you are a fan of these games and want to play them on a modern console I do recommend this collection. These classic games hold up great.",
                "2": "Great for my collection classic metal gear",
                "3": "My son loved this game .",
                "4": "Legends game I love it",
                "5": "I love metal gear solid one of my top favorites, being able to play it on the ps5 is the reason why I got it but it does come with a bunch of extra stuff for the day one edition which is really nice, no issues as far as quality so idk what others are talking about looks great on my oled",
                "6": "I've been an MGS fan since forever so when Konami announced the master collection pack back in the Summer allowing us fans to play them on the modern consoles I was already super giggity.\n\nFirst of all the game runs great!! MGS2 and 3 are straight port of the PS3 remastered edition so they both run at butter smooth 60 frame per second. I've dump hours into it so far and no weird glitches or anything like that so far. I haven't checked yet but I'm pretty sure they stay at 1080P at least for the PS5 version.\n\nFor MGS1 and the older MG entries...well none of the them have full scene support but they are already super old so I will give them a pass plus I have a HDTV that can force full widescreen anyway.\n\nOutside of some minor hiccups this collection is chuck full of contents!! I remembered playing the first game on the PC as a kid (they called that version MGS: Integral) and I was surprised that the PC version was included. IIRC Integral is basically the main game and the VR Missions expansion combined and you can pick Very Easy Mode where the game will provide you with an infinite ammo MP5 so you don't struggle as much. The only catch is that you do have to download a bunch of \"language packs\" that take about 2-5GB of space each before you can access to these outside-US region versions of the game.\n\nThe collection had also included the original MG, MG2, Snake's Revenge (A bastard sequel that Kojima have nothing to do with) and most of the digital novels that are done by Ashley Woods although just like the \"language packs\" you have to download them before you can access it. IIRC a blu ray disc have like 50GB so I find it rather lazy that they have to make us download a bunch of data to make everything fully playable.\n\nIn conclusion while it did slightly under-delivered and make you download a bunch of data before you can access everything it is a great collection chuck full of contents and a must have for every MGS fans!!",
                "7": "ANy Metal Gear Solid fan will love this game for the PS5. It arrived quickly and once downloaded was a great game!",

                "9": "My husband has been wanting this collection because he is a super MGS fan and I mean a dedicated one. He makes youtube videos of the characters and history and stuff as well as cosplay and plays the games over and over. I am also a smaller fan of MGS since ive watched timelines and stuff about the game. Hes been wanting this collection and now that i got it, I cant wait to see his face. Will update on xmas #)",
                "10": "4k would have been nice. And some loading times in mgs1 were long in cutscenes transitions.\n\nBut as a fan of the series who recently got back into gaming, I'm happy to be able to play them again. If you need 4k there are mods for the pc version. Can't wait for vol 2 to finally play mgs4"

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "Picked up the BlackShark V2 Pros recently, so far so good based on first impressions. These are definitely a step up as far as comfort, sound quality, and mic quality are concerned when compared to other Razer headsets. Note that the following review was typed out with the PC platform in mind, this headset will function wirelessly and via 3.5mm cable without THX audio support on PS4/PS5 but still takes advantage of 7.1 surround sound. As far as I can tell, these will not function via the wireless dongle on Xbox consoles but can still be used wired.\n\nComfort: Easily the most comfortable headset I've ever worn, the earcups are breathable and the headset itself feels very lightweight with no noticeable amount of pressure on my head. Haven't noticed any sliding issues with the thin metal bars that allow for fit adjustment, they seem surprisingly sturdy given how precariously delicate they appear to be. For a Razer product, it's surprising to see no obvious problems with build quality.\n\nSound Quality: Needs a bit of adjustment of the box via the Razer Synapse app. It took about five minutes to calibrate THX audio settings to my liking, but beyond that, everything sounds great! No complaints with bass, mids, and lows while listening to music or on Twitch/Youtube, the headset itself gets very loud on max volume with very little perceptible distortion. No in-game complaints so far either, the 7.1 surround sound seems to be properly calibrated for picking up low sounds such as footsteps and other audio prompts. To me, they sound almost as good as my Astro A50 Gen 4 headset for nearly half the price.\n\nMic: Very good for a wireless headset microphone after adjusting ambient noise and voice clarity settings,, haven't had any complaints from friends and randoms on Discord. I do have a couple of issues with it though:\n\n- Mic sidetone is very quiet even at full volume. Not a deal breaker for me personally, but it could be for those who prefer a more audible sidetone.\n- Placement within the headset can be a bit cumbersome upon insertion; can be finicky and will not function unless placed and spun counterclockwise. Takes a bit of trial and error but will stay in place once properly fitted.\n\nNoise cancellation: Passive only, will not filter out loud noises at same level as most closed back headphones. This seems to be the trade off for having such a comfortable fit. However, neither myself nor my partner have noticed any audio bleed or speaker audio being picked up by the mic.\n\nMiscellaneous: note that the earcups are not removable or replaceable, which is a strange omission given that the Blackshark V2 wired variant has that option. Go with those instead if you don't mind the wires and are looking to customize or properly maintain the earcups. The Pro variant also charges via an included Micro USB, which may be a turnoff for those who have already fully converted over to USB Type C.\n\nOverall verdict: definitely worth the $160 spent, I can't recommend the BlackShark V2 Pro enough. When it comes to Razer's audio options, this is definitely the way to go as far as their wireless headsets are concerned. This review will be updated if any issues arise over time.",
                "2": "First I want to preface by saying I just tested this for an hour at time of writing, but I will update after 30 days. This is my first Razor headset ever as I steered clear because of build quality, but this headset won me over...\n\nPros:\n-Best sound I have had on a wireless (gaming) headset and I have plenty, this is right under the steelseries arctis pro wireless which I did have for a test.\n-Good build quality and the metal hinges are super tight, some have had loose fitting ones, mine did not have those.\n-comfort, this is comparable to my arctis 7 2019 with brainwavz. I am going to mod some brainwavz on these too. The earpads are fine for most people stock though.\n-mic quality is very good, maybe the best I have heard on a wireless set, but this also leads to a small con as well which I will cover below.\n-razor synapse is good, I jumped in and set a v eq and then tested the gaming preset which was good also. Very good customizing here, gotta have an adjustable eq for me before I'm buying it.\n-battery life, TBD but it is very loud and advertises 20+ hours. No problems with it being quiet on pc and Ps5.\n-clarity is superb and thx is very good for my purposes.\nCons\n-it did not clip sound (distort) until I pre-amped it, but it really isn't needed. It did clip sound on ps5 if I maxed the USB up, but leave it at 90% and you should be good.\n-mic is a huge one, it's a cardioid style mic and it is pretty big, but it does have very good quality once dialed in with Synapse.\n-no THX on ps5, but 3d sound works just fine. On PC this is very high end sound imo as this can hit some really good kHz 28k and is near Hifi.\n-no USB C and is only micro USB, just a small gripe, not deducting from what this headset does.\n-will work on Xbox only if wired, but the 3.5mm cable Razor supplied is a nice braided L cable.\n-volume knob is huge, but that's aesthitics which is fine for most.\n\nOverall: If you have the money to spend a little more than 100 I would get this if your primary use is Pc/Ps5. This headset stomps the pulse 3d wireless and is better than my Arctis 7 2019 for my purposes of use. This will work wired as well, but I have not tested on Xbox. I will update after 30 days of use. Razor has made an exceptional headset here and this is going to be between Arctis 7 and this being my daily driver. Btw, I have large ears and this is still over the ear for me and is super comfy.\n\nUpdate Feb 4th: battery life, sound and comfort is still great. It sounds great wired on my series X using DTS sound unbound. The drivers have broke in a little bit and battery life is around 24 to 25 hours at about 65% volume. These get as loud as my gen3 A50's. Build quality should be fine as I don't see any failure points for my use and I baby these and keep them on a headset holder. These are still 5 star for me.\nUpdate 03/09/2021:\nThe Blackshark V2 Pro is still working fine and I have used this on my Series X (wired), PS5 (wired and wireless), and pc (wired and wireless). Battery life has been around 23 to 24 hours as the volume is kept around 70%. Mic has been fine when used on all platforms and the comfort after these have broken in is second only to my Arctis 7, which both are close in comfort. Nothing faulty and build has held up very well. I will say that it is a pain to change earpads, but other than that it's still a very good headset.",
                "3": "Razer BlackShark V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset: THX 7.1 ~150 USD\n\nThese earphones have beautiful sound and are very comfortable! There were no weird ear pains after extended use (for you hardcore gamers or audiophiles). I spent the first night owning them just listening to my stereo receiver (Marantz system). Playing high quality, lossless audio files, was great. MP3 will not make these headsets shine due to their crappy quality. Elder Scrolls Online was amazing with this set. I could hear all sorts of ambient and directional sound I never noticed before and felt much more immersed. That is saying a lot because I have very nice computer and stereo already connected together it plays though.\n\nThe Headset Setup - was both really easy and unclear at the same time. Once it was working and I understood its function it was been fine. I read the instructions and could not get the audio through to the set. Directly wiring them proved they could work and produce sound. Windows sound settings in my computer has 8 possible options listed. 'Speakers (Razer BlackShark V2 Pro)' was my 'wireless' setting. 'Speakers THX spatial' has never worked, I assume it is because I have not yet played THX film or THX certified audio yet. Wired, I saw it was 'Speakers (High Definition Audio Device)'. I have a lot of audio devices attached it seems weird they cant get 'wired' or 'wireless' or 'BlackShark' in to the listed options for clarity.\n\nCharging port - I think it is an old school usb mini port on the headset, for the price I expected something better. USB-C would have been nice, or a headset stand that charges. The port does not connect smoothly and can be inserted crooked easily. Fully inserted, it looks and feels halfway in, probably it is just poor manufacturing that it does not snug up to the plastic body well.\n\nIn my experience this is the headsets flaw, this charging port will be the failing point. Some dirt or dust or food piece gets in there or the tiny connector wires get worn or bent and it is all over for wireless. I have ruined handfuls of these ports in my past devices. I know the batteries will wear out in 3-5 years but I have sets that have lasted 15 years.\n\nI hope this helps someone out!",
                "4": "Let me preface by stating I am reviewing the Blackshark v2 pro. Sometimes amazon combines similar item reviews, this is important and that I have owned this for over a year with consistent usage, using it multiple days a week for 1-8 hours.\n\nThis thing has a lot going for it with very few downsides that in my opinion do not outweigh the pros and if you can get this for $150 or less it is 100% worth it.\n\nPros\n\n- Noise cancellation is so strong, sometimes I don't hear my wife when she calls for me. She was the one who bought this for me lol\n- Sound quality through synapse can be adjusted to your liking, and I can't recommend it without it (kind of a con)\n- Incredibly comfortable even with glasses. There is a lot of good padding on the head and ears, prior headsets this was always an issue, recently before this I owned a corsair void elite and even that wasn't perfect, but it was close in this category.\n- Battery life is actually really strong, just be sure to charge it after each usage. I've only ever gotten this to low battery where it beeps at me if I use it for 10-12 hours without charging it. Sometimes thats a long gaming day sometimes thats multiple days. I'm pretty good about keeping things charged, so this isn't a pain point for me, but may be for you. That said you can charge while using it.\n- Removable microphone, probably not a huge deal for most, but I use these as headphones not a headset. I use an external USB mic for better quality (I'll get into that later).\n- Ability to use this with 3.5mm port. I wouldn't recommend this without the USB function, as the USB DAC it comes with is decent enough and having used it without it, this is where it fails, but I'm labeling the 3.5mm port as a pro in case you have a multipurpose headset in mind\n- THX 7.1, now this is just virtual surround sound but in the couple games I have tried, notably monster hunter world, it performs really well, its weird to get used to but its done well enough. Not a huge selling point, you can get this elsewhere, but noted.\n\nCons\n\n- Without the USB DAC and synapse you are losing a lot of potential. This thing is really good for sound quality once you configure it, but on it's own it's horrible, this is why I did not get the wired version of the blackshark v2 with just 3.5mm.\n- Microphone quality isn't great, its honestly worse than most and for $180 it should be a lot better, this is why I use an external mic. Unless you're yelling, your friends will probably say you're quiet.\n- Intermittent disconnects, unsure if this is a hardware, connection or synapse issue but it happens infrequently it doesn't bother me, but should be noted.\n- Synapse, I swear I've had issues with every gaming software (ghub, icue, synapse) but recently synapse has been a pain. I love iCUE (or did) but hate corsair software, but if synapse continues to get worse I will look elsewhere for another headset.\n\nOverall, if I had to buy this thing again I'd do it for $130 or so. I wouldn't spend $180, I'd just get professional wired headphones, but this thing has a lot going on that it made it worth it to me. I recommend these headphones to anyone who is in the market for a wireless headset in this budget range who doesn't hold grudges against razer. In that niche, I think its perfect.",
                "5": "I bought these headphones as a wireless solution for gaming and listening to music in my room, as the corsair headset I had been using was both limiting in how far away from my PC I could get, as well as the fact that I kept tripping on the cord or getting it caught on my office chair as I'd roll it around.\n\nSet up:\nSet up for these headphones was easy and quick. I followed the included instructions, restarted my rig, and it was done. My only complaint here is that the included Razor software did cause some issues for some reason when it was running alongside Discord, so I've opted to not run it. Neither the headphones nor my Razor mouse have RGB, so it's not really a loss.\n\nSound:\nAfter using these for a week, and running some tests on them the sound seems good. The range they can reproduce seems to be 30 to just a few points under15,000 Hz. There is some rumble or buzzing when the bass frequencies are quickly modulated, and it can at times get a little muddy. This is especially evident if you adjust the volume at the same time, but this really was only noticeable while I was actively testing the sound, and doesn't come up often when gaming or listening to music where there are many different tones at once. I suspect that only the utmost audiophiles would really mind. (Which I'm not.)\n\nVoice:\nVoice is hard to judge when using VOIP because so much also depends on what the other party is sending out, your latency with the Discord or other server, and lastly your own audio equipment. As such the most I can say is that the headset was no disappointing and performed at least as well as any other sub-$200 headset I've used. I don't expect you're going to have the binaural experience of your life, but I have no complaints.\n\nMicrophone:\nSpeaking with those in my gaming group, they report that the quality of the voice I was sending with my mic was clear and crisp, and that there was no appreciable background noise. All in all, I'd rate it better than the Corsair HS60 I had been using.\n\nNoise cancelation:\nUsing these, I was unable to hear my wife.\n\nComfort:\nI've had issues before with other headsets feeling tight, or putting pressure on the arms of my glasses, which can over time be painful. Thankfully, the ear cups on these headphones are much lighter is the pressure they apply, and as a result I get no pinching or discomfort. Everything is very soft, and the experience is pleasant.\n\nFit and Finish:\nThe headset looks really well put together, and although I've already left some fingerprints on the satin black finish, it is relatively simple to clean.",
                "6": "Another Update: If you are noticing that these headphones sound lousy on your PC, muddy mid tones and non crisp audio, simply uninstall Razer Synapse and they will sound SO much better. I spent hours fiddling around with the EQ settings and I could never get them right even though they sound fantastic on my PS5. By uninstalling Synapse and just running these direct from the USB dongle, they sound so much more clear and crisp.\nAlso, if you're using windows, download Dolby atmos and just keep it on the default settings. I found that gives the most crisp, full, 3d audio that sounds fantastic\n\nYou can use Dolby Atmos through windows if you want to tweek the sound and get 3D audio and it even has an EQ so you have the best of both worlds. This should dramatically improve the audio quality\n\nUpdate: had these things for a few months and I still love them! They work great on my PS5 as well as my PC although it can get a little difficulty finding the right EQ settings and changes to them will drastically improve or degrade the sound. All in all, five out of five product\n----\nThese things are amazing! I was looking for a good pair of wireless headphones that were compatible with the 3D sound on my PS5. With the included dongle, these things are basically just plug and play; both my PS5 and PC effortless and quickly recognize the headphones when they are turned on.\n\nI'm not an audiophile, but audio in music and games is important to me. These things really shine especially at this price point and the fact that they are wireless. When I first tested them on my PS5, I wasn't blown away with the 3D audio, until I switched by to my old but high quality sanheauser headphones. WOW what a difference in audio quality and spatial awareness.\n\nAs with any good headphones, you're not getting the most out of them if you're not properly equalizing them. The headphones come with decent presets (on the synapse PC app) but I've included a better equalization in the picture. Switch between the default preset and this and you will really hear how well these headphones can shine with proper equalization. Very clear tones with rich bass!\n\nThe headphones are high quality. They do have a light grip on your head and and they will move around on your head, but for a person who wears glasses this is a good thing since they dramatically increase the comfort level and reduce the change of your glasses causing pressure points. The material on the headphones is a little spongy to finger prints but not a big deal.\n\nThe only thing that makes me nervous is the USB dongle situation. I would really like to order an extra dongle since I hope to take these between my PC and my PS5, so I worry if i lose this I will be out of luck. I bought a third party usb dongle but I can't connect them, so I think you are stuck with the factory Razer dongle that doesn't seem easy to replace. Not a negative, just a small drawback. I would feel much better if I could either buy a replacement dongle on razers website (you can't at the moment) or have the ability to connect to a third party dongle\n\nFor 170, these seem like a screaming deal. It's so much nicer playing on my PC now with fewer wires and they sound as good if not better than my wired headphones. I'd highly recommend these",
                "7": "I have used these a few times so far and feel like my opinion of them probably won't change much over time, pending some drastic change with them. I don't want to lie and say I don't like them, I ALMOST love them! There are just a few things that hold them back from being excellent.\n\nThe sound with these is just okay. I wasn't expecting studio quality or anything, but I think the audio could be a little better. I don't know if it is because of the THX Spacial audio that I need to figure out how to disable or adjust, but sometimes they sound tinny. Call me old school, but just give me two channels: left and right.\n\nThe battery life seems fine. I haven't allowed them to die, but I have used them over several days for a few hours each without concerns for battery life. I know I can access a rough battery indicator through the Razer software, but it would be nice to tap the power button and hear \"X percent battery remaining\" or something like that. Even the jankiest and cheap wireless headphones I've tried have this feature, but that's more nit-picky.\n\nCompletely unnoticeable latency from my experience. I have tried so many wireless headsets that end up in the garbage because they're advertised as \"Gaming Headsets,\" but when you have 500ms latency, you might as well mute the game. The fact that I can *mostly* use them wirelessly and not get caught up in my headset cord is magical. I catch myself trying to move the phantom cable out of my way because I am so used to it. It's like when I wear contacts and keep trying to push my glasses up, but it's a good feeling.\n\nI say that I can *mostly* use them wirelessly because these have a horrid range. I am sitting 3 feet from my PC using these, and I keep getting the disconnect/reconnect tone from turning to look out the window or even tilting my head to the side. From what I've seen, these are supposed to work up to 10 meters. The advertised 10 meters must be in a vacuum because, in my real-life scenario, I'm getting roughly 1 meter. I think Razer may have forgotten the decimal in \"1.0 meter\". Even reaching up with my hand to turn the volume up or down blocks the signal and disconnects. This \"feature\" is excellent for when my wife talks to me, though, because I can just put my hand up and \"mute\" them!\n\nThey are very comfortable. Some headphones I've used that are \"over the ear\" tend to be too small for actual over-the-ear coverage, or the headbands adjust in awkward ways that don't allow you to have a comfortable experience. The build quality is very excellent. They don't feel cheap and are put together well. I also love the removable microphone. So many gaming headsets have them built in and can't be removed.\n\nPros:\n* Decent sound for gaming.\n* Good battery life.\n* Unnoticeable latency.\n* Very comfortable and adjustable.\n* Removable microphone.\n* Nice build quality.\n* Volume knob built into headphones.\n\nCons:\n* THX Spacial audio seems lackluster.\n* Wireless range is terrible.\n\nUltimately, they would be fantastic, but they are literally being held back by the awful wireless range. I am fine with the fact that I can't go check the mail and still be connected, but when I'm sitting directly in front of my PC and have disconnects, that's enough to make them not worth the cost. Fortunately, they support a 3.5mm cable so if you need more range than 3 feet you should be fine. Honestly, if I had a better wireless option I would probably send these back today.",
                "8": "I use headsets mostly for discord, playing survival games, and listening to music—and although I would not classify myself as an audiophile, I can appreciate some degree of layering, and I certainly enjoy my bass. What I want in a wireless headset is comfort, lasting build quality, clear mic, good sound, and good range (tall order, I know, but I can dream). I am aware that wireless headsets are mostly not yet comparable in quality to wired headsets, I don't think technology is far off and I like being able to stay in conversation or listening to music while making food in the kitchen. In the end, I returned this headset after one month's use as the mic suddenly stopped working one morning when it was working perfectly the previous night. I tried to have the issue resolved to no avail and gave up. I simply did not want to push it when it failed me after one month with subpar range and sound quality. Read on for my in-depth ratings on each feature this headset has to offer.\n\nTHE GOOD\nComfort - 5 stars\nI liked the ear cuff size and material, the material is a breathable mesh which I have come to prefer after using this headset as it does not cause irritation around my ears like other leather-like materials tend to do. The build is overall light but surprisingly sturdy. I feel that these qualities allowed me to use them for long periods of time comfortably, which can go on for even 12+ hours sometimes (I am an artist so sometimes I get in the zone especially while listening to music).\n\nVolume Knob - 5 stars\nI also liked the volume knob, it has a middle divet so you always know where 50% is. It has just the right amount of resistance to not get accidentally bumped but still turn the dial effortlessly. I like the placement, easy to reach, but not in the way.\n\nBattery Life - 4.5 stars\nBattery life was great, I had only a couple times where battery was low during gaming sessions, in which case I was able to simply plug it in for charging and still use it at the same time.\n\nMobile Wire - 5 stars\nI also like the feature of the included 3.5mm jack so I could use my headset with my phone, which came in handy if I wanted to be in discord while making food in the kitchen as the range does not reach too well.\n\nTHE MEH\nMic Quality - 2 stars\nMy friends did not note anything spectacular about my mic sound quality, but it got the job done and they could hear me just fine. I was previously using a Razer Nari Essential prior, so maybe there were no significant changes to their mic technology. However, the mic mysteriously stopped working altogether for me after a month. I did everything I could to try to resolve it, but to no avail. I didn't want to keep a pair of $170 headphones so I have since returned them.\n\nSound Quality - 2.5 stars\nThe sound quality of the headphones are definitely subpar out of the box so you will want to download the program (I am personally unaware if other programs will work just as well). The preset options weren't amazing so it took some messing around to get it to something decent, but I imagine that audiophiles would rate the overall sound quality below average. The bass wasn't perfect but it did the job for me, I didn't sense a whole lot of layering in music unless I really strained myself to listen for them. I am not good at anything music-related but to me it seemed like there were blurry lines defining the sounds. Perhaps for that reason I did not experience immersion in my games anymore than the nari essential did.\n\nTHE BAD\nWireless Range - 2 stars\nFinally, my qualms with this headset... the range of this wireless headset was not amazing. My kitchen is maybe 15 feet from my room and the connection starts getting spotty once I enter the kitchen, and drops completely after two more feet. I was only able to get the extra two feet before dropping after moving the dongle from the back of my computer to the front.\n\nMute Button - 2 stars\nWhile I like the way the mute button pops in when muted and is popped out unmuted, the mute button is, in my opinion, poorly located. Even after a month I still had struggles reaching for the mute button sometimes despite being raised. It is just an awkward placement. There is no other indicator that you are muted unless you can feel whether the mute button is raised or pushed in.\n\nTHX Spatial - 1 star\nI did not care for this feature at all. I tried it with discord, music, and games, but all it did for me was muddy up sounds and make voices have a weird echo.",
                "9": "Saw good reviews for this headset and I am not disappointed. I wish it was dual 2.4/Bluetooth wireless but it works well on just 2.4ghz.\n\nYou can use audio enhancements in synapse and Windows sound panel when connected to 2.4ghz\n\nBut not when using the aux jack. When hooked up via aux jack, the headset will work when turned off so no battery is used. The mic allows for a decibel use and is plenty loud and clear, tested for remote work use. Audio output quality is the same as if thx spatial audio were on using 2.4ghz, this can be turned off in the windows control panel by disabling enhancements for the device.\n\nThe mic is detachable via 3.5mm jack as well, so there two aux ports on this. For the mic jack, if you don't want that microphone, you can buy a pro streaming mic and duct tape it to the headset and jack it in if you really wanted.\n\nBattery life after 10 hours of max enhancement and volume use still showing at 50%\n\nThese are 5 stars for a 100 ish dollar 2.4ghz wifi headset.\n\nEDIT: FOR PEOPLE WITH CONNECTIVITY ISSUES - AUDIO USES MORE BANDWIDTH THEN A MOUSE OR KEYBOARD - IF YOUR WIRELESS DONGLE IS PLUGGED IN NEAR YOUR MODEM THAT TRANSMITS 2.4ghz WIFI, OR OTHER 2.4ghz WIFI DONGLES - YOUR WIRELESS QUALITY WILL DROP SIGNIFICANTLY. USE USB HUBS TO GET 6-12 INCHES OF DISTANCE FROM YOUR OTHER 2.4ghz DEVICES - OR PLUG IT INTO THE FRONT USB PANELS, AND KEEP THE REST OF YOUR DONGLES IN THE BACK PORTS.",
                "10": "I bought this because I heard good things about the brand, and thus far.. I'm not impressed. I use this product because I game and use a PC in an environment where I some times need to be quiet and like not being tied to my pc with a cable. Over all the product is ok but I do have a few complaints. Here is the break down:\n\n1. The fit is pretty good and comforetable, although it my ears get hot and sweety after a while of usage.\n2. The battery life is pretty bad. After 4-6 hrs of usage (some times less) the batteries die and I need to recharge, which is horrible mid-game or in a meeting.\n3. After owning this for a while, the mic has just stopped working, I've checked the mute button, and sound settings, I have other mics in the home that work. But the one on my headset is just dead.\n4. The playback sound quality is pretty good for a cordless headset. While nothing beats a good set of studio speakers... this will do and is good enough that I don't actively notice sound quality issues when listening to music or gaming.\n5. The radio range you can travel from the usb dongle is lower than I expected. After going about 12 ft I notice a significant loss in sound quality, and after about 20 ft I get constant beeps and drops. So while this is cordless, you can't get far from the pc before you lose quality and signal.\n6. This does not actively cancel sound (that I know of) and while the ear muffs do block a fair amount of sound I still hear a lot going on outside.\n\nSo, Would I buy this again... probably not. It is not bad, but I'll trade having a cable for not having to recharge mid-game and have better audio. Also the premium price for having a cordless headset isn't really worth it to me either. If you regularly keep your headset charged, don't use it for more than 4 hours at a time, live in a cool environment, you don't mind paying for cordless features, and don't plan to travel more than about 12 ft from your pc this will probably work for you. For me this headset has gone un-used for a month now in favor of other headsets or speakers that better suit my needs."

                "1": "pros:\n- it feels nice\n- the buttons are really responsive\n- the controllers have a really nice texture\n- the joysticks feel nice\n- the design looks nice\n- it uses USB-C\n\ncons:\n- the joystick caps make the joysticks too tall for comfortable use\n- there was a small defect on the controller casing (a scrape with raised edges)\n- the Options/Share buttons being fully round, instead of ovals\n- the D-Pad is a full pad, as opposed to four individual buttons\n- it's gonna take a while to get used to the fact there's no deadzone on the left joystick, but that's ENTIRELY a personal issue\n\noverall, ABSOLUTELY worth the $20!",
                "2": "I really liked the controller, I was greatly disappointed when I tried to link it to my ps4 and it would not after several attempts. I did as the instructions said to and even reset several time with no luck.\n\nUpdate: was sent a new one and it linked with no problem. Works as expected. Customer service from the company was amazing to work with as well. Thank you!",
                "3": "Ordered this after my 3rd official ps4 controller died for same charge port failure. This is excellence in design. Pairing was effortless. Button response is instant. Button feel is the real star. It is outstanding. Highly recommend this. It is much more responsive than ps4 buttons. Loooong battery life.",
                "4": "I had the controller for a while and it worked well until today. Suddenly during game play the controller freaked out and now it won't respond to any button press and is stuck vibrating. Very disappointed that it broke from intermittent use within a year.",
                "5": "It's a cute controller, connected to the Playstation right away, works well and charge is good. Only thing is there is a small delay but barely noticeable. Great for the price and would recommend.",
                "6": "The right trigger stopped working after a few sessions, but the seller quickly reached out offering a full refund. I requested a replacement instead and the seller quickly sent an updated model with USB-C -- Very good connector.\n\nBoth controllers look and feel great, and I might guess the defective older model had been on a warehouse shelf, where the new one was shipped direct. A good find, sturdy and good service for a good value!",
                "7": "The AceGamer Wireless Controller for PS4 with its Purple Galaxy Custom Design V2 certainly catches the eye, offering a unique aesthetic that stands out from the standard controllers. However, the overall experience with this knock-off PS4 remote is a mixed bag.\n\nDesign (4/5):\nThe controller's design is undoubtedly its strongest suit. The Purple Galaxy Custom Design is vibrant and adds a touch of personality to your gaming setup. The textured grip feels comfortable in the hands, and the placement of buttons and analog sticks is familiar for any seasoned PS4 gamer.\n\nBuild Quality (3/5):\nHere's where the AceGamer falls short. While the controller looks flashy, its build quality doesn't quite match up to the original PS4 controller. The plastic feels a bit cheap, and the buttons lack the satisfying click that you'd find in an authentic Sony controller. The thumbsticks, while functional, lack the same precision.\n\nFunctionality (3/5):\nThe controller boasts additional features like 3.5mm audio and turbo function. The audio jack works fine, and the turbo function can be useful in certain games. However, it's worth noting that the turbo function can be a bit too sensitive, leading to accidental activations.\n\nCompatibility (3.5/5):\nThe AceGamer Wireless Controller is advertised as compatible with PS4, Slim, Pro, and Windows PC. While it does connect to all these platforms, the performance isn't always consistent. Some users report connectivity issues and input lag, especially on Windows PCs.\n\nThumb Grips (4/5):\nThe inclusion of two thumb grips is a nice touch, providing additional customization options for gamers who prefer a different feel. They are easy to attach and do enhance the overall grip on the thumbsticks.\n\nConclusion:\nThe AceGamer Wireless Controller for PS4 is a budget-friendly option for those who want a visually striking controller without breaking the bank. However, the compromises in build quality and occasional performance issues make it clear that this is a knock-off product. If you can overlook these drawbacks and prioritize aesthetics over performance, the AceGamer might be a suitable choice for casual gaming. Serious gamers, however, might find it worth investing in an official PS4 controller for a more reliable and satisfying gaming experience.",
                "8": "This controller feels really good in the hand with the textured grips. The buttons are renponsive and the sticks are nice and smooth. There's a bit of delay using the touch pad for navigation but that's a rarely used feature for me. It's nice that it comes with stick caps for a different \"feel\" depending on what you like. The only problem I have is the USB-C charging. Not that there's anything wrong with it, it just means there's another cable near the PS4.",
                "9": "Good controller and looks amazing for the price, but the controller buttons are not the best and the joystick is a little weird. I wouldn't recommend this controller for pro gaming but casual gaming it is perfect.",
