            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "It came in safe and all the wires i needed came with it, the controller as well. The ps5 itself is incredible, the graphics look amazing for such a tiny console, it‚Äôs easy to setup and sign into or create an account and the ps plus game pass thing is a good deal. I recommend this to anyone who wants to get a cheap and good console. God of War Ragnarok looks amazing btw",
                "2": "Very good as usual, quiet, planty of memory, running without any flaws.\nThis PS5 Slim is much better looking than regular PS5.\nThe box came a bit damaged but product was intact.",
                "3": "The PS5 box was fresh, still had the little tape seal at the top, the Call of duty MW3 Voucher was in there and does work. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the Amazon box they put the PS5 box in didn‚Äôt have a lot of cushion to protect it, but I mean the PS5 box already protects the PS5 pretty well.\n\nI also would recommend putting very specific instructions on how to find your address as they accidentally delivered it to my neighbors even if you live in a house and not an apartment just something to better identify your home.",
                "4": "By pure accident, this arrived 8 years to the day after I bought my PS4.\n\n8 years is a pretty good run for a console, but I figured it was time to upgrade, and I've been quite pleased with the results.\n\nUp front, the bad: the slim has a bit more storage than the \"fat\" PS5 but I worry that I'll quickly run out of space. And that's it. That's the extent of my cons list.\n\nThe good: outrageously quicker load times. I've been playing a lot of Fallout 76. On my PS4, it would routinely take upwards of 45 seconds to \"fast\" travel. I got in the habit of grabbing the phone and scrolling social media while it loaded. On the PS5, it's more like 10 seconds, tops. Usually much less.\n\nI've also been playing the new(ish) God of War and load times are almost immediate. It's uncanny.\n\nI've got an older TV (probably 2012) and even still, the graphics are a significant step forward.\n\nUltimately, it's everything I loved about my PS4, except better. There's not a single area where I feel like they took a step back except in storage...I had a 1 TB Black Ops 3 edition and would have liked the PS5 to beat that without resorting to aftermarket help.\n\nOtherwise, the controller feels better in my hands and has some cool bells and whistles (integrated mic, multi-function giant button, etc.), the load times are vastly improved with the SSD, and the games look better and run better.",
                "5": "The devices work so good, is light and fast !",
                "6": "The whole bundle came as advertised a brand new slim 2023 ps5 model with the removable disc drive, none of the marketing or descriptions disclosed that so i wasnt sure if this was the first model of ps5 or the new slim model that you can attach a disc derive to and it is indeed the new model with a modular drive. Copy of Spiderman 2 came with it as well as a download code, thats y only real \"comlaint\" i wish it was a game case with a disc but you cant complain for the price of the bundle you get a new revised slim version of the ps5 and a new game with it, i love the feel of the ps5 controller its way better than the ps4 controller. Biggest thing i've noticed is the console is absolutly silent to the point i have forgotten it was even on because my PC fans on low are louder than it. Overall a great console and a great bundle if you've been waiting to upgrade from ps4 as i have, this is the time you should take that chance to upgrade and now i can take full advantage of my 120hz 4K moniter so all in all this was a perfect bundle to buy as an early christmas present for yourself or someone else who's wanted to upgrade to the next generation consoles.",
                "7": "I could be wrong but I think the picture looks better than the old one. It‚Äôs a good buy if you don‚Äôt have one. The smaller one is OK. I had the older version and it‚Äôs noticeably smaller but not worth it if you own one. AS FOR COD MW3: Pay attention to your essential schedule. I‚Äôve lost hours to his game because its just so good. It looks good and takes advantage of HDR. So many different available things to do but for sure activision is trying to figure out how to get their money out of you. A good bundle.",

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.",
                "2": "I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\n\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\n\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\n\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\n\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\n\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\n\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\n\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.",
                "3": "I bought this to make sure I stayed active in my retirement years. Easy to use. Realistic beyond belief. If you wear glasses, make sure you put in the glasses spacer. You can do this by removing the black rubber around the perimeter of the mask. Start at the nose and pull up. Put in the spacer, then reattach the rubber. Makes a big difference. Favorite games are Beat Saber, 7th Guest, and the Jig saw puzzles. First time on 3D puzzles. Amazing.\n\nStop before you get tired, otherwise you might find yourself trying to lean against the realistic tables to rest a minute (7th Guest). You won't do it more than once! They're not really there! Have fun.",
                "4": "This is an entry level VR headset and it's excellent for its price. I love it. There are quirks with it. Please mind that it was introduced to the market in late 2020 (so 3 years ago from this review) which is eons ago in tech space, so it's getting old, but I still love it.\n\nYes it's heavy, yes it works best when connected with a USB cable (for high FPS use), yes it's a little irritating to use generally because when in VR you have to interact with the world around you. So there's the learning curve. You need to invest time using this VR headset before submitting a review because things in VR are disorienting at the beginning -- think like the first time you used a trackball or a mouse.. took time to master.\n\nThat being said, I use it primarily for sim racing, it's comfortable, and it's absolutely incredible, so much that once you have the straps figured out properly and worked out the kinks, you can't tell it's even there. The sound that comes out of it is very immersive and good, the field of vision is excellent (I have one bad eye and I see 20/20 with the headset), I love the experience so much that I stopped using other sim racing games that don't support VR. I spend a lot of time on real race tracks in real life, and this VR headset allows me to spend time on the race track when it's raining out or when the season is over.\n\nBuy it, you won't regret it",
                "5": "I bought this knowing the Quest 3 was out, but the price was the primary consideration for me at the time. I find this to be better or fit my needs better as I only wanted something for PCVR, and this fits the bill fine if you're seeking out for that experience without paying too much.\n\nWhat are some of the pros? One was that I found the overall setup experience to be seamless and relatively headache free. Second, the controllers and headset feel sturdy and well made, probably meant to withstand accidental scrapes and impacts with objects, cause that will happen regardless if you're careful with your play area. Third is the integration with Steam VR, and you can just play any games in your library from the get-go without any issues as long as you have a cable that supports the bandwidth required, or also charge while playing so you can have an extended session.\n\nThe only con that I have with this headset is the lack of IPD adjustability, which means I have to wear my prescription glasses and attach the spacers if I want to use the headset and not experience any blurriness. The Quest 3 has it built in as standard, but is also $200 over the MSRP of the Quest 2. It's not exactly the biggest drawback honestly, as it can vary from person to person.",
                "6": "At 26, and with a love for all things fun and techy, the Meta Quest 2 has been my latest craze. It's like unwrapping a present every time I put it on‚Äîwith its vast world of games and immersive design experiences. Just a heads-up from someone who values comfort as much as a spontaneous dance-off: get the Elite Strap. It's the comfort upgrade that lets you play longer, design more, and dive deeper into VR without that 'need-a-break' feeling. Trust me, it's the smart move!",
                "7": "I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I‚Äôd see if it was all I‚Äôd hoped it might be. Holy freakin‚Äô crap!\n\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that‚Äôs my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I‚Äôve instructed it.\n\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I‚Äôm spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I‚Äôm firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I‚Äôm really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn‚Äôt really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\n\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I‚Äôll be using like crazy.\n\nTonight I‚Äôm going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it‚Äôs even better that I imagined.

                "8": "This quest 2 is awesome. I bought my son one three years ago and he played with it daily. It just stopped working so I bought another.",
                "9": "This was the best thing i've ordered in my life. I had tons of fun with it. The only things i dont like is the default headstrap. Its super uncomfortable. But you can always buy a new one, the... elite headstrap.\n\nAlso, the charger had an american outlet shape, so i couldnt stick it anywhere, but i came up with a solution and somehow fused it with one of unused cables that go with my outlet's shape and the charger works perfectly now.",
                "10": "Pros:\n- Fairly Immersive.\n- Amazing experiences.\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\n\nCons:\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA‚Äôs. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‚Äòpass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends‚Äô fantasy.\n\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro‚Äôs and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it‚Äôll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I‚Äôll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I‚Äôve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This‚Äôll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\n\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\n\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\n\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you."

                        "1": "The Meta Quest 2 has revolutionized my gaming experience like never before. This cutting-edge virtual reality headset has completely transformed the way I interact with games, movies, and even social experiences. From the moment I put it on, I was transported to a world of limitless possibilities, making it an absolute must-have for any gaming enthusiast.\n\nThe first thing that impressed me was the Meta Quest 2's stunning display. The high-resolution, fast-switch LCD panels deliver crystal-clear visuals, providing sharp details and vibrant colors that truly immerse you in the virtual environment. Whether I was exploring fantastical realms or engaging in heart-pounding action, the visuals were breathtakingly realistic, pulling me into the gaming world like never before.\n\nThe Quest 2's performance is unparalleled. The powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 processor, coupled with 6GB of RAM, ensures seamless and lag-free gameplay. I experienced smooth frame rates, minimal loading times, and overall responsiveness that kept me fully engrossed in my gaming adventures.\n\nComfort is a significant factor in any VR headset, and the Meta Quest 2 excels in this department. The lightweight design, ergonomic straps, and soft facial interface provided a comfortable fit even during extended gaming sessions. Additionally, the adjustable IPD (interpupillary distance) settings ensured that I could fine-tune the headset for a custom fit, enhancing the overall comfort and visual experience.\n\nThe Meta Quest 2's Touch controllers are a joy to use. They are incredibly responsive and intuitive, mimicking my hand movements with impressive accuracy. From wielding a virtual sword to manipulating objects in the virtual world, the controllers effortlessly translated my actions into the game, creating a sense of true immersion and control.\n\nThe wireless nature of the Quest 2 is a game-changer. No more tripping over wires or being tethered to a PC; the freedom to move around without any constraints elevated my gaming experience to a whole new level. With its built-in tracking capabilities, I could explore vast virtual worlds without being tied to a specific spot.\n\nThe Quest 2's library of games and experiences is vast and continually growing. From thrilling action titles to captivating exploration games, there's something for every gaming preference. The Meta platform also offers a social space, allowing me to connect with friends and family in virtual reality, bridging the gap between gaming and social interaction.\n\nSetting up the Meta Quest 2 was a breeze. The guided setup process and user-friendly interface made it easy to get started quickly. The headset's integrated guardian system helped create a safe play area, preventing collisions with real-world objects while I was fully engrossed in my virtual adventures.\n\nIn conclusion, the Meta Quest 2 is a game-changing virtual reality headset that has transformed my gaming experience. Its stunning visuals, powerful performance, and comfort-enhancing design immerse me in virtual worlds like never before.

                        "2": "I hate how my local gym canceled the Les Mills Body Combat classes on the days i can go, but I like how I can now take the classes on Meta Quest 2 in subversive VR. I work up a sweat and can choose as many workouts as I want. So I don't even miss the class at the gym being taken away! This is awesome!\n\nOn another note, being first submerged into the VR world, I was amazed and it took my breath away. I didn't know where to begin, but it did have a great tutorial that took place within my own \"house\" environment.\n\nThere are soooooooo many games and apps and things to do and see, a lot of it free, it is hard to figure out what to try and do. I love how YouTube VR has totally 360¬∞ videos and VR videos thar border on creepy how realistic they can be. One lady rubbed latex gloves by my ears and it felt real and raised the hairs on my head and body as she played a tuning fork while doing this \"reiki\" healing. Idk if it is real Reiko, but it felt so real, it was just mindblowing.\n\nAnother video showed what sleep paralysis (which I do have sometimes) is like, and while it isn't entirely what I've experienced, some parts are very much scary how real they felt, esp the end of the video.\n\nThere's VR social worlds, as you can design your avatar to look like you or whatever version of yourself you want to be. I gave myself purple hair! I was sad to see the skin color choices were all realistic and no green or purple or red, lol. So it sort of forces you to look like a regular person, even if you can buy cheap outfits of role play and fantasy style stuff like queen of dragons or samurai outfits. In your home, you have a mirror to show you what you look like and you can change it anytime.\n\nSometimes you see other people and wonder what you look like to them. But it doesn't matter. It's all fun to see other people that are real also playing games or Body Combat alongside you and against you vying for first place. It makes it more fun!\n\nI haven't tried the chat world's or social meetups, but I don't know where to begin.\n\nThis can consume one's daylight hours easily just exploring where to begin or finding favorite games to play. Some are pricey, but even I paid whatever for Body Combat, as it was well worth it.\n\nEverything had Bern amazing so far, and as someone with kids and taking online classes, I don't have much free time to explore worlds, and i have to watch the virtual watch on my wrist to keep track of time or set an alarm on my phone to remind me to do things before it's too late, lol.\n\nSo far, this has been an amazing purchase. I saw it at CostCo and looked it up and saw Amazon had it cheaper, and I could make 5 monthly payments for it, so I went with buying it on Amazon.\n\nYou can take photos, but I can't find them to post here. You alsoncan use your microphone to voice commands or talk to people or bots or just issue commands to change how things look or appear.\n\nI can't even begin to sum up how amazing this stuff is, but I did try! Worth every dollar I paid for sure. And now the Quest 3 is coming out at over double the cost. I can't imagine it getting better than this, but the headset can be stuffy esp when working out and sweating üòÖ so i hear the Quest 3 will help fix that and make a thinner headset etc. And no more rounded controllers.\n\nYou can make boundaries for your world and be warned if out of bounds so you don't knock into things like chairs, beds, plants, cables, other stuff. And I have one set up for when I'm in bed! Some are made for lying down and sleeping. It's crazy.",
                        "3": "I feel like the guy from \"Ready, Player One\" with this! When you put it on, time flies, so I'm glad the battery doesn't last forever (a couple hours)! It's dangerous if you're using it plugged in, because with unlimited power, you can easily stay up all night! So much to see and do, through the online web browser and all sorts of games and apps. I signed up for Supernatural and am working out every day - endless workout routines and music playlists to choose from! I also connected with a long-distance friend and had his avatar sitting in my virtual home chatting with me, and playing games with me - so awesome! Also signed up for the monthly Meta+ membership to get 2 new curated games every month. Can't wait for the mini golf next month to play with my friend! Also love the meditation apps, TRIPP, Maloka, and Liminal, and I'm not into meditating, but the music and visuals are so awesome and relaxing! A great way to get refreshed after a workout or wind down before sleeping. Options are endless on this thing and I'm so glad I finally took the plunge - well worth the money! I also bought the Kiwi Comfort Elite strap which is more comfortable and easier to adjust the fit than with the standard strap, and I got cloth covers to absorb sweat when exercising.",
                        "4": "Good for first time virtual when I am used to gaming council systems. I was supposed to receive a 50 dollar gift card for this and the charging station for Amazon I have yet to see it.",
                        "5": "I got this initially for Beat Saber and branched out to other games. I did get an aftermarket head-strap and sport facial interface.\n\nDespite a very strong eyeglass prescription, progressive lenses and a pupil distance between the clicks I have clear vision in VR and experience no dizziness or nausea.\n\nSeveral friends have tried it and enjoyed it.",
                        "6": "I bought these for my adult children this Christmas. Everyone was very excited and loved using it. Thinking of getting one for myself.",
                        "7": "OMG, this is a life changer! Until this week, I haven't played video games since Atari and then later, Ice Breaker. That's it. I just wasn't interested. Then... I saw an advertisement for this product and getting fit by having fun. That did it. I put it off because of the cost but I finally got it. I am SO not sorry. Right now, I'm playing solo games (and of course, on easy mode) BUT I play multiple times a day. I love VR and I haven't experienced any vertigo or dizziness that others report. It's a little blurry because of my eyesight (farsighted in one eye and near sighted in the other) but prescription lenses are available through VR Optician so I think the blurriness will be much better once I get the new lenses. If you haven't experienced VR yet, or you want to get active without \"working out\", I recommend you give this a try. I think you'll love it as much as I do. And, FYI, you aren't \"watching\" a screen, this is a 360 degree, interactive experience. Happy gaming!",
                        "8": "Let me start by saying that this headset is really awesome for the price. There's just not any VR headsets out there in this price range, and this is a decent one by any standard. That's for sure. I 100% recommend it. My kids and I have had a blast with it. There's fun for the whole family. Even my 4 year old can sit and ride roller coasters, despite barely being able to hold the controllers.\n\nThat said, there are a few things that could be improved, and unfortunately the latest version of the Quest is double the price of this one (too much for my blood):\n-Screen casting. So yesterday I had the option to screen cast to the TVs on my network. Today? Nope. Now it says to cast to my phone and mirror to the TV. Literally overnight they took away a great feature. What the heck?? I searched the internet and there are others saying the same thing. I hope they bring it back soon. It's great to share your experience with others or help your small kids through things.\n-Weight/comfort. This thing is pretty heavy to have on your face for a long time. It can be difficult to get it to fit comfortably with the OOTB strap. They skimped a bit on the straps for sure. I've ordered a better strap and hope it helps with comfort.\n-Battery life & charging cability. They say the battery lasts 2 hours, which I question, but even 2 hours seems like nothing on a weekend where all of the kids take turns on the headset nonstop all day. So I hooked up a 15' USB charging cord (which you have to buy seperately, mind you), but the charging is still just barely able to keep up to the power draw on a 2 amp charging block (total 10 watts of charging). So you better be sure you don't accidentally yank that USB cable out of the wall.\n\nI'm ordering a QC3.0 charger (a 3 amp charger) in hopes that it helps (people on the internet say it can charge up to 15 watts on the Quest 2) with a 15' cable that is rated for 30 watts to ensure I don't have a bottle neck in my cable. A 50% boost in charging speed would be great. It's a shame that they didn't design it to just use a barrel plug w/ an AC adapter, which could give you way more power than a standard USB-C connection. Plus you wouldn't have to worry about making sure you have the correct (and expensive) USB cables and adapters, which would still be the case even if they used high-wattage PD power delivery. I hate being constrained by batteries, and even more so by batteries and slow chargers.",
                        "9": "OMG THIS WAS MY BEST PURCHASE OF 2023. I didn‚Äôt know how much I was missing not having a VR for myself and gaming. This was a life changer. From traveling the word to dungeon diving against goblins and skeletons the Meta Quest 2 can do it all. I bought to get into VR after hearing about the Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro. I love playing games but YouTube and other apps are the cherry on top. I recommend it for anyone wanting to get into VR, I think it‚Äôs a great intro",
                        "10": "This headset is an upgrade from my old one which was the gear vr (one that uses your phone) which was great at the time but as phones got bigger they didn't fit in that any more. I love being able to use it without a phone. Games are a bit more expensive then the old one but much more worth the money you pay. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a VR. I recommend club vr and superhot to get started but there are so many good options."

                        "1": "Update: Five Weeks Later\n\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\n\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\n\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else.\n\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they had made a lighter headset without the upgraded passthrough, but now passthrough is everything to me. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Eleven Table Tennis, and Meta Quest Browser for AR female hologram eye candy. One of the first AR games that I tried is a free game called First Encounters. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\n\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\n\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I might have bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I am sure that I will keep installed and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\n\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general.\n\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the default Quest 3 wall charger and link cable. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging the cord or the Quest 3 cable. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\n\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\n\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\n\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\n\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App lets you stream your PCVR games to your Quest headset, wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers. Virtual Desktop lets you have a virtual desktop in passthrough mode, but Immersed lets you too and in Immersed you can have up to four computer screens and you get to be around other users and their avatars. I still use Virtual Desktop for the head lock feature, which keeps the desktop screen in front of your face no matter what direction are are facing or where you move or walk to. I use it to read manhua while walking around the house for exercise. I am hoping that the headlock feature will be added to Immersed soon.\n\nResident Evil 4. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is VR or something but it truly is fun walking around in a realistic setting. I like the scenery better than Arizona Sunshine or The Walking Dead. The first Red Matter game was great, but sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value once you've completed the story. Green Hell looks really interesting. It's a realistic survival game. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game that is sorta interesting if co-op RPG games are your thing. It is a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. Genotype is a bit interesting. but the texture detail isn't as high as I would like.\n\nFor fitness, I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\n\nI also suggest getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR). On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and mirror you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\n\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor in PCVR games. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\n\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems.\n\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\n\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 65% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people to try the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much?",
                        "2": "I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\n\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\n\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\n\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\n\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\n\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\n\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\n\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\n\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\n\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\n\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!",
                        "3": "There is no doubt this thing is superior to the Quest 2 in almost every way possible. Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.\n\nPros -\nDisplay - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.\n\nAudio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvement\n\nAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.\n\nCons\n\nDisplay\n\nWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.\n\n1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.\n\n2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.\n\n3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.\n\n4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.\n\nComfort\n\nThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.\n\nEcosystem\n\nThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headset\n\nPassthrough\n\nThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.",
                        "4": "Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\n\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR¬π, thus far the native apps aren‚Äôt of interest] and didn‚Äôt use it as much as I‚Äôd expected.¬≤ With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I‚Äôve ZERO regrets.\n\nüò∫ Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\n\nüòª Lenses: WOW!\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2‚Äôs Fresnel lenses and the Q3‚Äôs pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the ‚Äúsweet-spot‚Äù is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\n\nüò∫ Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I‚Äôm viewing the world through a scuba mask.\n\nüòø Contrast: comparable\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\n\nüòª Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨\n\nüòª IPD settings: significantly improved\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\n\nüòê Controllers: neutral\nI liked the rings on the Q2‚Äôs because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3‚Äôs. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\n\nThings I‚Äôve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I‚Äôve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\n‚Ä¢ battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n‚Ä¢ sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n‚Ä¢ eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\n‚Ä¢ native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\n\nOverall: while I‚Äôm sad there weren‚Äôt any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it‚Äôs a still terrific bargain. It‚Äôs a shame about the contrast though üòπ\n\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn‚Äôt have wifi enabled and couldn‚Äôt figure out why it wouldn‚Äôt pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\n_____\n¬π ‚Äî For PCVR I‚Äôm using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta‚Äôs own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I‚Äôve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I‚Äôve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop‚Äôs ‚ÄúHVEC 10-bit‚Äù encoder, which graphically is better than the plain ‚ÄúHVEC‚Äù encoder, also has a lower latency!]\n\n¬≤ ‚Äî Considering the price I paid vis-√†-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.",
                        "5": "So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\n\n- The clarity of the new \"pancake\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\n\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\n\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\n\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\n\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\n\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\n\nThe comfort\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\n\nBattery life\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\n\nPCVR\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\n\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.",
                        "6": "I've been in the VR game for a while now, going all the way back to the Oculus Rift dev kit 2 days. My other current headset is a Valve Index, and I mainly bought the Quest 3 with the intention of playing the Quest-exclusive games, fully expecting it to feel like a toy in comparison.\n\nIn practice, I'm in love with this thing. The displays are both high resolution and high quality, with little to no screendoor effect, and the tracking is impressively stable for something only being tracked by cameras and software. I thought the removal of the rings from the Q2 controllers would cause them to have more issues with occlusion, but I haven't noticed anything. Even the features I didn't know it had are pretty cool for the games that support them, like its mixed reality and controller-free hand tracking. But the thing that's really going to keep me away from my Index (at least for the games that aren't specifically tailored to it, like Half Life Alyx) is that I had no idea how much I needed to ditch the cable and play wirelessly until now. Being able to just walk around in my room without having to be aware of the cable behind me is such a nice feeling that it feels like I'm getting into VR for the first time again.\n\nWith that said, there are some small caveats -- namely, that this is not really a $500 headset. Meta has taken on a sort of Spirit Airlines approach, where the headset itself is affordably priced in exchange for other basic things being extremely expensive \"accessories\". The strap is the main offender, with the default one being the rough equivalent of just tying the headset to your head. They're happy to sell you a $60 strap, or a $130 one that extends the battery, though! And while you're at it you can blow $80 on a cable for linking it to your pc if you aren't a fan of wireless tethering, a $70 carrying case, a $40 silicone facial interface for extra comfort, a $130 charging dock to replace the controllers needing AA batteries, $40 hand straps for the controllers to give them Index-esque free-hand support... To be clear, most, if not all of these have off-brand counterparts that are just as good (or better!) for a fraction of the price, but my point is this is not a fully out of the box experience for those with more discerning tastes. For parents buying them for their younger children they'll probably be thrilled with it anyways, and can safely ignore all of that, but I would wager most adults will probably end up wanting at least a new head strap of some kind, whether it's the official one or not.\n\nIgnoring the troublesome accessories, though, this is an easy win as far as I'm concerned. The only real competition is that the Quest 2 is still holding its own as well from what I hear, and for prices that seem to be as low as they could possibly be around the holiday season. I can't speak first-hand on whether the Q3 is worth a $300 difference, but I can say I don't regret buying it. I held off on the Quest line of headsets because I've never been a big fan of Meta as a company, but I have to begrudgingly admit that this is probably the best vr headset at the best price you could get right now.",
                        "7": "I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.",
                        "8": "I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\n\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \"rug burn\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone‚ô°",
                        "9": "I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\n\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\n\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\n\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!",
                        "10": "Buy the Quest 3, DO NOT BUY THE QUEST 2. I still use my Quest 2 it's great but I don't care how cheap it is, the Quest 3 is that much better in both performance and visuals. Even games not updated still look and play smoother. The Quest 3 is good enough to get into VR gaming without a PC. The Quest 1 felt like a gimmick , the Quest 2 was good but still felt compromised but the Quest 3 (while obviously not as a good the average PCVR gaming pc) is able to get much closer and provide a PCVR like experience on newer games. Mixed reality was not something I was interested in but after trying it I think it's awesome, even if you consider it a gimmick it's very cool and fun tech. As someone who really only cared about PC based VR gaming I've been very impressed with the Quest 3. After going on a VR binge in 2019 and some of 2020 I've mostly only played VRChat now but because of the Quest 3 I started exploring VR games again trying out new and old games and even mixed reality stuff too. It's that good but I'd recommend an aftermarket headstrap. The included headstrap seems pretty bad but if you fiddle with it A LOT it can get comfy. Also I returned my 128GB model and bought the 512GB one. It should not cost that much more in price but honestly there's so much cool stuff and games are slowly getting bigger. If you have fast internet , you can buy the 128GB and be fine.\n\nThere's tons of amateur and professional unboxing videos of the Quest 3 that you can look at if you want to see what it looks like. As for what it's like to buy and own it? It's amazing.\nBackground info: I've been a computer based VR player since 2017 when I got the original Oculus Rift also known as the CV1 on a Black Friday sale. Since then I've bought an Index in 2020 with vive trackers for full body tracking, a Quest 1 as a backup headset, a Quest 2 and now a Quest 3. I have about 6000 hours in VR 5000 of that is in VRChat.\nReview: The Quest 3 is incredible. It's my first VR headset that uses pancake lens and it's beautiful. I dabbled in standalone gaming on my Quest 2 with games like Resident Evil 4 VR and Iron Man VR which were both great. Iron Man felt a little held back resolution wise with aggressive foveated rendering BUT THE Quest 3 fixes that mostly with higher resolution in literally everything. Everything from the interface to all old and new games feel snappy. I started playing mixed reality mini games like the Ghost Busters one and Synth Riders and the free built in Alien one and everything has been super cool. it's all surprisingly fun. Audio is also great, about as good as the Index. The whole thing feels more reliable though as my Index cable is annoying with how heavy and thick it is. I'm on my third cable in 3 years and still the Index needs to be unplugged sometimes to make it work. I've had no such problems on my Quest 2 and Quest 3. The only reason I still use my Index is for easy full body tracking in VRChat otherwise I play everything on my Quest 3."

                "1": "Step into the realm of gaming greatness with the Xbox Series X, the Hercules of consoles ‚Äì muscular, powerful, and ready to elevate your gaming experience to celestial heights! Assembling this gaming marvel was simpler than beating level one of a classic arcade game. Unbox, plug in, power up, and voila! I was transported into a world of immersive gaming splendor.\n\nLet's talk power, folks! With a whopping 1TB SSD, it's like having a storage vault for every gaming adventure imaginable. The 16GB RAM felt like having a brain that processes game data quicker than a cheetah chasing its prey. The console revved up like a finely tuned sports car, promising gaming speeds faster than my cat chasing a laser pointer.\n\nThe promise of true 4K gaming sent shivers down my spine. The graphics were so sharp, I could almost see the pixels having a party! And with up to 120 frames per second, it's like watching a movie in fast-forward, only it's your gameplay and not a rom-com.\n\nThe Wireless Controller is like an extension of your own hand ‚Äì sleek, comfortable, and responsive. It's like having a magic wand (minus the spells, but hey, your gaming skills might feel magical).\n\nThe Velocity Architecture? It's like having a gaming time machine, reducing loading times to mere blips on the screen. I blinked, and suddenly, I was in the midst of epic battles without the agony of waiting.\n\nHowever, even this gaming behemoth has its kryptonite. The only downside? The wallet might feel a bit lighter after acquiring this gaming beast.

Let's be real ‚Äì this console isn't going anywhere. It's like a monolith, firmly rooted in your gaming universe. But who needs maneuverability when you're anchored in a realm of gaming nirvana?\n\nIn conclusion, the Xbox Series X is a titan among gaming consoles, a symphony of power, graphics, and sheer gaming delight. It's a gaming paradise that turns button-mashing into a delightful symphony of pixels. So, grab this console, embrace your inner gaming legend, and embark on gaming adventures that'll leave you shouting \"Achievement Unlocked!\" like a boss!",
                "2": "I bought this for Christmas for my son and we love it. It‚Äôs very user friendly and the graphics are wonderful. The package it came in was fun and very professional! Downloading disc games can take a while sometimes, but the system is fantastic! I absolutely adore the backwards compatibility!!! Absolute favorite feature for sure! This was the main selling point for me when I was looking into a new console to buy. I didn‚Äôt see the point in buying a PS5 if I couldn‚Äôt play the PS3 games that I currently have from my older system. At least with the Xbox series X I can still play the 360 games that I have and even buy more 360 games if I want! The memory is outstanding as well! Xbox also has a family settings app so I can keep up with the games my son is playing and how much time he logs on his system, as well as any messages from ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù Definitely worth the money in my opinion. Family friendly. User friendly. Just amazing. Keep up the good work Xbox!",
                "3": "I love this console. Between the full backwards compatibility, the semi compact size, and the amazing performance, it's a great bang for buck! Much more performance than a similarly priced PC. Everything is smooth. Really worth the upgrade from an Xbox one.",
                "4": "This here Xbox Series X console, is the best of the best!!!! High speed power, 120 FPS, gaming power to the max!!!! Such a great purchase, I will purchase again in the near future for accessories!! Thank you Amazon for your amazing support on this product. I couldn‚Äôt thank you enough for the support.",
                "5": "Been wanting to upgrade my Xbox since this was announced. Finally was able to. Already opened up a couple games and was NOT expecting for them to load SO fast and to look SO clear and beautiful! So happy with this purchase!",
                "6": "Very simple to set up and transfer from an Xbox One and felt the difference between next-gen. It's very helpful in showing what your setup can and can't do. At $399.99, the Series X is worth it.",
                "7": "I have been a gammer all my life, have owned almost every console since the Atari Pong all the way till the Ps4 and Switch, but I have skipped most Xbox' s except for the original that was given to me as a gift.\nThis new console that Microsoft has made is in my opinion the absolute best in this generation. Spec-wise it cannot be beat and if superior to the PS5 I most respects. But when you use your series X and in conjunction with Game Pass Ultimate (GPU), it simply becomes the hands down, no questions asked, absolute BEST VALUE in gaming anywhere! Today Microsoft has also teamed up their GPU service with EA, and now we can get most sports games and most EA titles included in GPU. But you must also add the future inclusion of Bethesda and all their amazing titles from day one in GUP since MS has bought them out.\nSo how can't you go wrong with the MOST POWERFUL CONSOLE EVER MADE and the potential of including GPU to make it the best value in gaming PERIOD.\n\nYes some will think that their are few titles specifically made for this new generation as of this writing, but the same goes for Playstation, and Sony changed their mind in the short term, as most titles that they have as great exclusives are also being released for the foreseeable future on PS4 as well as PS5.\n\nPROS:\n- Best Value in gaming when used with Game Pass Ultimate.\n- Most powerful console ever made (12TFLOPS - 52 CU's).\n- Intuitive and very functional OS.\n- Great games even for this generation like: Medium.\n- FPS Boos feature for older games.\n- Automatic HDR for older games.\n- Instant Resume feature is just awesome!\n- Great controls, I thought I would not like them, BUT THEY ARE GREAT!\n- Minimalistic design, that goes well with anything you have already.\n- QUIET there is no noticeable sound of fans even when gaming for hours.\n- More available space in internal drive then PS5.\n\nCONS:\n- Controllers use a AA Battery... WHY would you do this in 2021? Yes there are options, but I should not need to look for options, personally for now I went the rechargeable Energizer route, but it is a hassle that should not be present in a console this generation.\n- No gimmicks and straightforward pure power, no you don't get resistance in the adaptive triggers like a PS5, makes it feel a bit less futuristic.\n- Had a bug happen to me more then once while purchasing new games, got an error, so for workaround had to add to cart, go to billing address, put edit, select the same billing address and then it worked, very annoying.\n\nSPECS:\n- Processor: 8-core AMD Ryzen Zen 2-architecture CPU at 3.8GHz (3.6GHz with SMT)\n- Graphics: AMD Navi/RDNA 2-family GPU with 52 CU at 1.825GHz (12TFLOPS FP32)\n- Video:16GB GDDR6 with 14Gbps 320-bit interface (10GB at 560GB/s allocated to GPU, 6GB at 336GB/s allocated to rest of system with 3.5GB for GPU)\n- Die Size: 360.45 mm2\n- Process: 7nm Enhanced\n- Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w/ 320mb bus\n- Memory Bandwidth: 10 GB @ 560 GB/s, 6GB @ 336 GB/s\n- Internal Storage: 1 TB Custom NVME SSD\n- I/O Throughput: 2.4 GB/s (Raw), 4.8 GB/s (Compressed, with custom hardware decompression block)\n- Expandable Storage: 1 TB Expansion Card - Seagate ATM only avail.\n- External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD - WB Black Gaming 5TB what I got for it.\n- Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive-\n- Performance: 4K @ 60 FPS, up to 4K @ 120 FPS, 8K @ 60 FPS\n- Size: 301mm x 151mm x 151mm\n\nFinally, I will recommend this console over the the PS5, its simply a BEAST and a better value when teamed with GPU. I won't get a Ps5 for the foreseeable future at least not till late 2022, since by then they might really have PS5 exclusives that don't get. a PS4 version.\nThe Xbox Series X is such a great console that you would be hard pressed to look it over over the hype that the Ps5 has generated because of its lack of availability. So if you like simply the best console this generation and wish to get the best bang for your buck, Xbox Series X simply rocks.\n\nPRO+ : The Xbox series X is also an amazing emulation system, it can run Retroarch with no hacks, with nothing weird, just look it up in YouTube and you will find tutorials. But it can do emulation like very few systems and it add to its tremendous lineup and value.\n\nGreat job Microsoft, you not only added a customer, but a new fan.",
                "8": "Delivery was fast, 2 days. Box was well packaged, sealed Xbox x.\nSet up was simple, even for me. You just use your phone to set it up. I had a quick issue where the code that was sent wasn‚Äôt working, so wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the code, or something incorrect with my email/password. At that point, the Xbox wouldn‚Äôt let me power off using the controller, so I manually turned it off, waited a couple minutes, started again, restarted the ‚Äúnew console‚Äù set up, new code that worked, and before I knew it, I was at the Home Screen.\nNo noticeable cosmetic or technical issues. This is definitely a nice upgrade from Xbox one.\nLove premium game pass, and the user interface is similar to Xbox one. Controller provided takes double A‚Äôs, so will buy another one with a bit more quality without dealing with batteries.\nI used the disc drive, it works which is great, my old Xbox one blue Ray drive stopped working a couple years ago.\nI will give an update after more use and game play, but initially, very happy to have this. I‚Äôve held out a long time for one of these! Worth the wait!\nUPDATE: Xbox X is great. Blu-ray drive works, love the quick resume option for games. Format is familiar like Xbox One, so not a lot of changes on the Home Screen and such. No issues playing games, watching movies, etc. very much like having this. Fun for everyone! Graphic updates are nice, however, if your using an older TV you prob won‚Äôt see too much difference. Highly recommend if your still on the fence about purchasing.",
                "9": "So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box? Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.\n\nYou open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it's in a treasure chest. It was great! I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console. So good job on that!\n\nI'm upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade. I've got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it! I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.\n\nAnd here it is.\n\nVisually speaking, I'm not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S. There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren't there before. Everything is less fuzzy. So that's good. It's just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES. Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2. But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One. The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me. I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I'm playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.\n\nAnd that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games. While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn't anything on the Xbox that can't be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility). With Halo Infinite being delayed, there's no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.\n\nWell... I SAY that but I also don't regret doing so. I'm disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice. And it isn't even the best part of the Series X. That would be the load times. With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast. I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done. This thing zips along. That also applies while you're in the game. Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly. There's a lot of power in this rectangular box. The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it's not a selling feature if you're comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.\n\nIt's a lot of the \"under-the-hood\" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One. The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox's back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you'll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren't brand new exclusives. I've got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now. If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service. I spent my first day just downloading everything I'm going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.\n\nAnd, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass. You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X. It's a good deal.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase. I wish Halo would have made launch. I'm also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it's worth playing. But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable. In the end, it comes down to where your friends are. Mine are on Xbox so here I am. This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I'm going to regret having it a year or so down the line.\n\nBut if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don't really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season. Miles Morales looks really good.\n\nBut if Sony's exclusives don't move you, the third party games are all multiplatform. You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin's Creeds on whatever console you manage to get. In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there's enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.\n\nOh! This thing also has a controller! It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller. This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version. There's a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch. So Microsoft is a little behind but it's here now! I have not used it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it.\n\nAnyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware. This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time. Day one, you know what you're getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.\n\nBut, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)",
                "10": "Our old Xbox One was dying a few months back, so we bit the bullet and upgraded to this. We both play, so we also got an extra controller (the console comes with one). I took the extra one, and my husband took the one that came with the console. In case you're curious, my old controller's buttons were starting to give out as well right around the time the console was dying, and my husband wanted a backup controller, hence the need for two new controllers instead of just one. Anyway...I was using the \"extra\" one because it's purple (yay!). It works fabulously. The console itself is amazing because all the games we have played load ridiculously fast, and the graphics are amazing. Then the not great part: my husband's old controller (which we *just* bought last Christmas) died one week after getting the new console up and running. No biggie, we have the new controller to use, right? So he grabbed the one that came with the console and started using it. That was just a few months ago. The stick drift started a few weeks ago, and it got really bad really fast. That controller is straight up unusable now. Thank god for the black friday sales coming up this month. Given how new the console and controller are, I thought someone would help us, but no. Neither Amazon nor Microsoft/Xbox care one bit. I guess less than 6 months is now the expected lifespan of a new controller? At least the console is nice."

                        "46": "This product works well. It is kinda loud but doesn‚Äôt effect gameplay. The only other issue is that the batteries included do not show fully charged through Xbox Series X system. It always shows 3/4 battery life but does last as stated in product description.",
                        "47": "This charging stand works exactly as described. It's helped keep our Xbox from overheating (which was starting to become a problem) and continue running smoothly. It fist nicely in the intended slot. The controller chargers work without any issues, and the additional USB slots are great for plugging in extra things, like charging phones. The extra batteries are a very appreciated extra. The only warning I'd give is to make sure your TV stand/cabinet have the space needed to fit the dimensions required for the Xbox with the stand. Unfortunately, I failed to measure in advance and had to place it in a new location to make it work. Otherwise, no issues noted.",

The neon green looks really cool with his lights off. The controller batteries last for a long time and I know my son hasn't asked me for batteries since we bought this! That makes this a huge money saver for me! I think this is definitely worth the money!",

                        "50": "Pros-\nSpace saver- The unit itself has a slim profile. It doesn't take up a lot of space on my tv stand. That's an absolute plus, because there's a lot going on up there.\nOrganizer- I love that it will hold your chargers in a way that looks good instead of having them laying around, and then you have to search for them. At least that's me.\nLooks cool- It's just a neat looking set up.\nLights- Gives a nice touch without being so bright that it distracts from your game play. I like that you can turn them off, though.\nExtra Ports- You always need more ports. This gives you 2.\n\nCons-\nUSB cord is really short.\nFans- I'm not sure if this is cooling my unit down much. Maybe a couple of degrees.\n\nOverall-\n4 Stars. You are getting a nice looking product that organizes and charges your stuff.\nI am taking one star off for the price and the fan performance.\nI don't think the performance matches the price.",
                        "51": "This is a very cool potential solution - variable cooling fans and a dedicated charger for two controllers, with some cool lighting effects to boot. It‚Äôs designed so you can plug it into your XBox directly, gaining 2 extra USB2 ports in the process. In practice, the fans seem to make little difference, and the chargers can be a little fiddly to seat your controllers into properly. The lights are cool, though I generally turn them off when I‚Äôm playing a darker game. The direct power is cool, but only works when your Xbox is on (you might be able to get around this in Settings), so you‚Äôll need some longer play sessions if you want to top off both chargers. The overall build is nice, but feels very lightweight, which is always a little concerning when you‚Äôre using it with such expensive hardware. Overall, it is a good product, though a touch underwhelming for the price.",
                        "52": "This is a nice upgrade that saves you some space by not having to make room for chargers or needing to pull your batteries out of your controllers to charge them. I like that I can pop my controllers onto the sides of the base to charge them. The chargers come with a couple of caveats though - you need to have the latest Xbox controllers and they don‚Äôt charge all Xbox batteries. I do like that the base comes with two batteries. Only time will tell how long they last after multiple recharge cycles.\n\nAs for other features of the stand - the lights are nice but I‚Äôm glad you can turn them off, which is what I did. I like the extra USB ports the base provides.\n\nOne thing I don‚Äôt like about the base is that you physically need to slide a switch to turn it on. It would be nice if it turned on automatically when you turn your Xbox on and turns off when you turn your Xbox off.\n\nWhen I comes to heat dissipation, I‚Äôm not too sure it has that much of an effect on it. After playing a few hours with the base‚Äôs fan turned on my Xbox feels as warm as it normally does. It might make the Xbox a few degrees cooler but you shouldn‚Äôt expect a drastic difference in cooling.\n\nOverall, the base is a nice upgrade and I like that I can connect a charger on both sides of up. I always know my controllers are charged now and can quickly connect a drained controller to the stand to get it charged back up.",
                        "53": "Works well so far and the Xbox fits nicely. I like that you can change the color of the lights and if they are flashing or solid, so that's nice to customize.\n\nThe downside is that the USB cord to plug it in to power is very, very short. The entire thing is about 10 inches, so you have to have a USB outlet very close. Also, the only controller that fits was the one that came with it. My other controllers, which are Xbox brand, don't fit. In the picture the black controller port is the one that works. Placing it on the charger isn't super smooth, you have to line it up just right and since it's open it doesn't slot right on. You run the risk of scratching your controller. I have a different charger for my PS5 that has inset holder for the charging of the controllers and they slot right in but since these are just open you have to line it up just right.\n\nThe batteries did fit nicely and you can't put them in the wrong way and it's nice it comes with 2.\n\nOverall it seems to work but the controller charging is what holds it back from 5 stars for me. If it fit all my controllers and was easier to just put them on without risking scratching then it would be much nicer. But so far it does work well and the color changing is a nice touch."

                "1": "Update: Five Weeks Later\n\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\n\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\n\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else.\n\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they had made a lighter headset without the upgraded passthrough, but now passthrough is everything to me. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Eleven Table Tennis, and Meta Quest Browser for AR female hologram eye candy. One of the first AR games that I tried is a free game called First Encounters. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\n\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\n\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I might have bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I am sure that I will keep installed and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\n\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general.\n\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the default Quest 3 wall charger and link cable. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging the cord or the Quest 3 cable. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\n\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\n\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\n\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\n\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App lets you stream your PCVR games to your Quest headset, wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers. Virtual Desktop lets you have a virtual desktop in passthrough mode, but Immersed lets you too and in Immersed you can have up to four computer screens and you get to be around other users and their avatars. I still use Virtual Desktop for the head lock feature, which keeps the desktop screen in front of your face no matter what direction are are facing or where you move or walk to. I use it to read manhua while walking around the house for exercise. I am hoping that the headlock feature will be added to Immersed soon.\n\nResident Evil 4. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is VR or something but it truly is fun walking around in a realistic setting. I like the scenery better than Arizona Sunshine or The Walking Dead. The first Red Matter game was great, but sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value once you've completed the story. Green Hell looks really interesting. It's a realistic survival game. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game that is sorta interesting if co-op RPG games are your thing. It is a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. Genotype is a bit interesting. but the texture detail isn't as high as I would like.\n\nFor fitness, I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\n\nI also suggest getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR). On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and mirror you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\n\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor in PCVR games. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\n\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems.\n\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\n\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 65% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people to try the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much?",
                "2": "I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\n\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\n\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\n\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\n\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\n\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\n\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\n\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\n\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\n\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\n\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!",
                "3": "There is no doubt this thing is superior to the Quest 2 in almost every way possible. Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.\n\nPros -\nDisplay - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.\n\nAudio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvement\n\nAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.\n\nCons\n\nDisplay\n\nWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.\n\n1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.\n\n2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.\n\n3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.\n\n4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.\n\nComfort\n\nThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.\n\nEcosystem\n\nThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headset\n\nPassthrough\n\nThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.",
                "4": "Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\n\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR¬π, thus far the native apps aren‚Äôt of interest] and didn‚Äôt use it as much as I‚Äôd expected.¬≤ With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I‚Äôve ZERO regrets.\n\nüò∫ Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\n\nüòª Lenses: WOW!\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2‚Äôs Fresnel lenses and the Q3‚Äôs pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the ‚Äúsweet-spot‚Äù is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\n\nüò∫ Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I‚Äôm viewing the world through a scuba mask.\n\nüòø Contrast: comparable\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\n\nüòª Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨\n\nüòª IPD settings: significantly improved\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\n\nüòê Controllers: neutral\nI liked the rings on the Q2‚Äôs because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3‚Äôs. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\n\nThings I‚Äôve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I‚Äôve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\n‚Ä¢ battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n‚Ä¢ sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n‚Ä¢ eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\n‚Ä¢ native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\n\nOverall: while I‚Äôm sad there weren‚Äôt any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it‚Äôs a still terrific bargain. It‚Äôs a shame about the contrast though üòπ\n\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn‚Äôt have wifi enabled and couldn‚Äôt figure out why it wouldn‚Äôt pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\n_____\n¬π ‚Äî For PCVR I‚Äôm using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta‚Äôs own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I‚Äôve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I‚Äôve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop‚Äôs ‚ÄúHVEC 10-bit‚Äù encoder, which graphically is better than the plain ‚ÄúHVEC‚Äù encoder, also has a lower latency!]\n\n¬≤ ‚Äî Considering the price I paid vis-√†-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.",
                "5": "So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\n\n- The clarity of the new \"pancake\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\n\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\n\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\n\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\n\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\n\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\n\nThe comfort\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\n\nBattery life\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\n\nPCVR\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\n\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.",
                "6": "I've been in the VR game for a while now, going all the way back to the Oculus Rift dev kit 2 days. My other current headset is a Valve Index, and I mainly bought the Quest 3 with the intention of playing the Quest-exclusive games, fully expecting it to feel like a toy in comparison.\n\nIn practice, I'm in love with this thing. The displays are both high resolution and high quality, with little to no screendoor effect, and the tracking is impressively stable for something only being tracked by cameras and software. I thought the removal of the rings from the Q2 controllers would cause them to have more issues with occlusion, but I haven't noticed anything. Even the features I didn't know it had are pretty cool for the games that support them, like its mixed reality and controller-free hand tracking. But the thing that's really going to keep me away from my Index (at least for the games that aren't specifically tailored to it, like Half Life Alyx) is that I had no idea how much I needed to ditch the cable and play wirelessly until now. Being able to just walk around in my room without having to be aware of the cable behind me is such a nice feeling that it feels like I'm getting into VR for the first time again.\n\nWith that said, there are some small caveats -- namely, that this is not really a $500 headset. Meta has taken on a sort of Spirit Airlines approach, where the headset itself is affordably priced in exchange for other basic things being extremely expensive \"accessories\". The strap is the main offender, with the default one being the rough equivalent of just tying the headset to your head. They're happy to sell you a $60 strap, or a $130 one that extends the battery, though! And while you're at it you can blow $80 on a cable for linking it to your pc if you aren't a fan of wireless tethering, a $70 carrying case, a $40 silicone facial interface for extra comfort, a $130 charging dock to replace the controllers needing AA batteries, $40 hand straps for the controllers to give them Index-esque free-hand support... To be clear, most, if not all of these have off-brand counterparts that are just as good (or better!) for a fraction of the price, but my point is this is not a fully out of the box experience for those with more discerning tastes. For parents buying them for their younger children they'll probably be thrilled with it anyways, and can safely ignore all of that, but I would wager most adults will probably end up wanting at least a new head strap of some kind, whether it's the official one or not.\n\nIgnoring the troublesome accessories, though, this is an easy win as far as I'm concerned. The only real competition is that the Quest 2 is still holding its own as well from what I hear, and for prices that seem to be as low as they could possibly be around the holiday season. I can't speak first-hand on whether the Q3 is worth a $300 difference, but I can say I don't regret buying it. I held off on the Quest line of headsets because I've never been a big fan of Meta as a company, but I have to begrudgingly admit that this is probably the best vr headset at the best price you could get right now.",
                "7": "I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.",
                "8": "I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\n\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \"rug burn\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone‚ô°",
                "9": "I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\n\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\n\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\n\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!",
                "10": "Buy the Quest 3, DO NOT BUY THE QUEST 2. I still use my Quest 2 it's great but I don't care how cheap it is, the Quest 3 is that much better in both performance and visuals. Even games not updated still look and play smoother. The Quest 3 is good enough to get into VR gaming without a PC. The Quest 1 felt like a gimmick , the Quest 2 was good but still felt compromised but the Quest 3 (while obviously not as a good the average PCVR gaming pc) is able to get much closer and provide a PCVR like experience on newer games. Mixed reality was not something I was interested in but after trying it I think it's awesome, even if you consider it a gimmick it's very cool and fun tech. As someone who really only cared about PC based VR gaming I've been very impressed with the Quest 3. After going on a VR binge in 2019 and some of 2020 I've mostly only played VRChat now but because of the Quest 3 I started exploring VR games again trying out new and old games and even mixed reality stuff too. It's that good but I'd recommend an aftermarket headstrap. The included headstrap seems pretty bad but if you fiddle with it A LOT it can get comfy. Also I returned my 128GB model and bought the 512GB one. It should not cost that much more in price but honestly there's so much cool stuff and games are slowly getting bigger. If you have fast internet , you can buy the 128GB and be fine.\n\nThere's tons of amateur and professional unboxing videos of the Quest 3 that you can look at if you want to see what it looks like. As for what it's like to buy and own it? It's amazing.\nBackground info: I've been a computer based VR player since 2017 when I got the original Oculus Rift also known as the CV1 on a Black Friday sale. Since then I've bought an Index in 2020 with vive trackers for full body tracking, a Quest 1 as a backup headset, a Quest 2 and now a Quest 3. I have about 6000 hours in VR 5000 of that is in VRChat.\nReview: The Quest 3 is incredible. It's my first VR headset that uses pancake lens and it's beautiful. I dabbled in standalone gaming on my Quest 2 with games like Resident Evil 4 VR and Iron Man VR which were both great. Iron Man felt a little held back resolution wise with aggressive foveated rendering BUT THE Quest 3 fixes that mostly with higher resolution in literally everything. Everything from the interface to all old and new games feel snappy. I started playing mixed reality mini games like the Ghost Busters one and Synth Riders and the free built in Alien one and everything has been super cool. it's all surprisingly fun. Audio is also great, about as good as the Index. The whole thing feels more reliable though as my Index cable is annoying with how heavy and thick it is. I'm on my third cable in 3 years and still the Index needs to be unplugged sometimes to make it work. I've had no such problems on my Quest 2 and Quest 3. The only reason I still use my Index is for easy full body tracking in VRChat otherwise I play everything on my Quest 3."

                        "1": "First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.",
                        "2": "I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\n\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\n\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\n\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\n\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\n\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\n\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\n\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.",
                        "3": "I bought this to make sure I stayed active in my retirement years. Easy to use. Realistic beyond belief. If you wear glasses, make sure you put in the glasses spacer. You can do this by removing the black rubber around the perimeter of the mask. Start at the nose and pull up. Put in the spacer, then reattach the rubber. Makes a big difference. Favorite games are Beat Saber, 7th Guest, and the Jig saw puzzles. First time on 3D puzzles. Amazing.\n\nStop before you get tired, otherwise you might find yourself trying to lean against the realistic tables to rest a minute (7th Guest). You won't do it more than once! They're not really there! Have fun.",
                        "4": "This is an entry level VR headset and it's excellent for its price. I love it. There are quirks with it. Please mind that it was introduced to the market in late 2020 (so 3 years ago from this review) which is eons ago in tech space, so it's getting old, but I still love it.\n\nYes it's heavy, yes it works best when connected with a USB cable (for high FPS use), yes it's a little irritating to use generally because when in VR you have to interact with the world around you. So there's the learning curve. You need to invest time using this VR headset before submitting a review because things in VR are disorienting at the beginning -- think like the first time you used a trackball or a mouse.. took time to master.\n\nThat being said, I use it primarily for sim racing, it's comfortable, and it's absolutely incredible, so much that once you have the straps figured out properly and worked out the kinks, you can't tell it's even there. The sound that comes out of it is very immersive and good, the field of vision is excellent (I have one bad eye and I see 20/20 with the headset), I love the experience so much that I stopped using other sim racing games that don't support VR. I spend a lot of time on real race tracks in real life, and this VR headset allows me to spend time on the race track when it's raining out or when the season is over.\n\nBuy it, you won't regret it",
                        "5": "I bought this knowing the Quest 3 was out, but the price was the primary consideration for me at the time. I find this to be better or fit my needs better as I only wanted something for PCVR, and this fits the bill fine if you're seeking out for that experience without paying too much.\n\nWhat are some of the pros? One was that I found the overall setup experience to be seamless and relatively headache free. Second, the controllers and headset feel sturdy and well made, probably meant to withstand accidental scrapes and impacts with objects, cause that will happen regardless if you're careful with your play area. Third is the integration with Steam VR, and you can just play any games in your library from the get-go without any issues as long as you have a cable that supports the bandwidth required, or also charge while playing so you can have an extended session.\n\nThe only con that I have with this headset is the lack of IPD adjustability, which means I have to wear my prescription glasses and attach the spacers if I want to use the headset and not experience any blurriness. The Quest 3 has it built in as standard, but is also $200 over the MSRP of the Quest 2. It's not exactly the biggest drawback honestly, as it can vary from person to person.",
                        "6": "At 26, and with a love for all things fun and techy, the Meta Quest 2 has been my latest craze. It's like unwrapping a present every time I put it on‚Äîwith its vast world of games and immersive design experiences. Just a heads-up from someone who values comfort as much as a spontaneous dance-off: get the Elite Strap. It's the comfort upgrade that lets you play longer, design more, and dive deeper into VR without that 'need-a-break' feeling. Trust me, it's the smart move!",
                        "7": "I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I‚Äôd see if it was all I‚Äôd hoped it might be. Holy freakin‚Äô crap!\n\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that‚Äôs my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I‚Äôve instructed it.\n\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I‚Äôm spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I‚Äôm firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I‚Äôm really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn‚Äôt really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\n\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment.

I can see this is going to be something I‚Äôll be using like crazy.\n\nTonight I‚Äôm going to try watching a movie on it.

                        "10": "Pros:\n- Fairly Immersive.\n- Amazing experiences.\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\n\nCons:\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA‚Äôs. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‚Äòpass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends‚Äô fantasy.\n\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro‚Äôs and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it‚Äôll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I‚Äôll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I‚Äôve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This‚Äôll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\n\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\n\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\n\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you."

                        "1": "I bought this to ease the frustration of my 9 year old. He plays games like Gorilla tag. We bought a comfort strap a few months ago so comfort wasn‚Äôt the problem. The issue was the battery life. My son would be playing a game and making friends and then all of a sudden, the battery would die. He would get upset - not throw a tantrum - but visibly upset because he wouldn‚Äôt be able to play with the kids he just met. My son doesn‚Äôt have many friends so he would be devastated if he lost contact with someone that was fun to be around. I invested in this strap to prolong the life of the Meta Quest. I charge both the headset and the battery backup so when he‚Äôs ready to play, he has the most battery life. He‚Äôll start by playing with it unplugged but the moment he sees the battery is low, he connects the extra battery and is good to go. I was worried about the weight but it works great. It fits his head very well because it‚Äôs adjustable. My son has been a much happier gamer since we purchased this and have had no issues or complaints.",
                        "2": "The thing I'm most impressed with with is how good the support was when I had an issue with my head strap. They email me back right away to fix the issues. No questions asked",
                        "3": "We have the meta quest 2, and the battery lasts about 2-ish hours. We haven‚Äôt had to charge this battery pack in days, and it stays charged SO good. The strap is SO much better than the quest strap as well, makes it so easy to fit to every head.",

The only issue is that I always find the strap uneven and I always have to reset it for them by disconnecting the battery, fully extending it and then forcing the left side of the strap out as I twist the knob. Just by changing the size from one kid to the next it starts becoming uneven. Is this common? It ain‚Äôt a big deal as long as it doesn‚Äôt break. I was going to give it 3 stars but we are very happy with performance and fitment for the value so far so I‚Äôll give it 4. If the strap didn‚Äôt do this, it would get a 5. I‚Äôll reach out to the manufacturer and if they can replace it with a functioning strap, I‚Äôll change to 5.",
                        "7": "Very comfortable!!!!!!!",
                        "8": "I troubleshooted Amazon to see if they could be of 'help'....they forwarded a 'link' to me that would connect me to the 3rd party seller. I am in the middle of reconciling this but would like to receive a 'replacement' elite strap with battery. They have been very cooperative, so far! (That's why I gave them 3 stars!). This company sent me a replacement for this BUSQUEDA Elite Strap with Battery for Oculus Quest 2...received it in a timely manner.....Quick response!",
                        "9": "The two best things about this Oculus Quest 2 strap are the comfort and the extended battery life.\n\nThis is my second strap upgrade for my Oculus Quest 2. The strap that comes with the Quest 2 is OK, just not quite comfortable enough for long sessions. I upgraded to a knock-off elite strap. It was better, but I still wanted better comfort and a longer battery life without the need for an external power pack.\n\nThe Busqueda Elite Strap gives me what I was craving for a Quest 2 strap. It is super-comfortable with a larger section at the back that softly cradles the back of my head. The battery is mounted at the back and that adds to the comfort because it balances the weight of the heavier Quest at the front. Plus, it gives a few more hours of paly time on the Quest without the battery dying.\n\nI often watch movies with my Quest while laying on my back or relaxing in a recliner with a pillow behind my head. Even though that battery adds bulk to the back of the headstrap, it did not affect the comfort when using the Quest in this position. It was even more comfortable in this position than my previous strap that had less bulk.\n\nI really liked the look of the strap too. The battery charge indicator on the back of the strap was a nice feature too. It indicates how full the battery charge, turns red when charge is low, and indicates when the battery is charging. The glowing ring looks really nice. My only wish is that the glowing ring charge indicator would stay lit at all times when the strap was in use providing power to the Quest. For the indicator to light up, you have to turn the dial a bit or have the unit charging.\n\nIt seems to be stupidly constructed with just enough flexibility to make sure the strap isn't brittle and subject to easily breaking. Time will tell if it remains so. It is easy to install on the Quest if you know how to detach and attach Quest straps. Once you get the hang of this, it is easy.\n\nI do wish that there were better, clearer instructions with this strap. If I didn't already know how to detach or attach a Quest strap, I would have struggled with this installation. But that is the case for any Quest strap. There are enough YouTube videos out there to show how to do this.\n\nOverall, a good, sturdy comfortable Quest 2 strap that I would highly recommend.",
                        "10": "This review is a bit early. I've had the headstrap for one day, but wanted to post my thoughts at this point.\n\nUPDATED BELOW\n\nThe reviews look great. My number one concern was the few reviews that spoke of a not-quite-right USB-C connection. I'm a pro IT person, i've been doing IT for a couple decades and can even remember when USB 1 came out, it was amazing. Since then i've worked with countless USB connections and cables. When i first got this headstrap, i noticed the USB connection seemed loose compared to every other USB C connection i've worked with. Another reviewer mentioned that the developers of this headset instructed her to push harder. I figured she was new to USB and maybe was slightly off. I'm far from new at USB, so i know exactly what i'm doing, it definitely seemed loose. I like the rest of the headset so much that i figured i'd grab a USB-C coupler and jerry-rig my own connection. Well i discovered when plugging the headstrap into my USB C coupler that there is a little snap when it pops into place. This never happens with USB-C. The force i used to pop it in was not something i wanted to do to the Quest, because i don't want to break it. The weird part is that the snap seemed like it was made that way. So i went ahead and pushed a little harder when plugging it into my Quest. It did the same thing as when i pushed harder with my coupler, it popped in. After connecting it, it felt much better connected to the Quest. Before the pop in, the connection (charging-wise) was hit and miss. So although i've only had this headstrap for a day, if the pop in is by design, then bravo, headstrap well done. If i start having any issues with consistent charging, i'll update this post. For now this headset feels like a 6 star deal. I highly recommend it.\n\nThe rest of the headstrap is awesome. It fits really nice. I have an average size head. I can't say much for the battery life yet but will try to update this post.\n\nI really think the seller of this headstrap should elaborate about this connection/snap issue. It's not a normal USB thing. Tell us if what i've stated about the connection is correct.\n\n2022-01-16\nOk, well i haven't heard from the seller. Here's an update from me. The headstrap stopped charging. It never fully passed-though and charged the headset. The max i saw the headset charged to was 86-96%. The first couple times i used it, it did charge the headset, but not anymore. Last night i played 1.5 hrs of VR and ran out of power (as if the headstrap wasn't charging the headset). I replugged it a couple times and it started charging then stopped. I pretty much had to stop playing i ran out of power. I'm currently talking with Amazon to have it replaced. I'll update this post with how the second headstrap plays out. I moved the star rating to 3. If its just one faulty unit, i'll get that star rating back to 5+, if i get a second faulty unit, i'll rate it 0 (expensive paper weight), we''ll see soon.",
                        "11": "This strap fits my head well, and the adjustment knob keeps a tight fit. My biggest concern was the chirpy speaker that made a shrill noise every time I touched the back. Loud shrill noises right next to my ears are a big bother, I eventually took matters into my own hands and opened up the battery pack to desolder the speaker from the circuit board. (Would not recommend unless you are confident and careful with electronics repairs)",
                        "12": "I‚Äôve gotten 3 to 4 extra hours play with this . I use it nightly , over time you need to watch out for wear and tear like all things"
