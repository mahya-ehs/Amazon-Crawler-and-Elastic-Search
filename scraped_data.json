                "1": "It came in safe and all the wires i needed came with it, the controller as well. The ps5 itself is incredible, the graphics look amazing for such a tiny console, it’s easy to setup and sign into or create an account and the ps plus game pass thing is a good deal. I recommend this to anyone who wants to get a cheap and good console. God of War Ragnarok looks amazing btw",
                "2": "Very good as usual, quiet, planty of memory, running without any flaws.\nThis PS5 Slim is much better looking than regular PS5.\nThe box came a bit damaged but product was intact.",
                "3": "By pure accident, this arrived 8 years to the day after I bought my PS4.\n\n8 years is a pretty good run for a console, but I figured it was time to upgrade, and I've been quite pleased with the results.\n\nUp front, the bad: the slim has a bit more storage than the \"fat\" PS5 but I worry that I'll quickly run out of space. And that's it. That's the extent of my cons list.\n\nThe good: outrageously quicker load times. I've been playing a lot of Fallout 76. On my PS4, it would routinely take upwards of 45 seconds to \"fast\" travel. I got in the habit of grabbing the phone and scrolling social media while it loaded. On the PS5, it's more like 10 seconds, tops. Usually much less.\n\nI've also been playing the new(ish) God of War and load times are almost immediate. It's uncanny.\n\nI've got an older TV (probably 2012) and even still, the graphics are a significant step forward.\n\nUltimately, it's everything I loved about my PS4, except better. There's not a single area where I feel like they took a step back except in storage...I had a 1 TB Black Ops 3 edition and would have liked the PS5 to beat that without resorting to aftermarket help.\n\nOtherwise, the controller feels better in my hands and has some cool bells and whistles (integrated mic, multi-function giant button, etc.), the load times are vastly improved with the SSD, and the games look better and run better.",
                "4": "The devices work so good, is light and fast !",
                "5": "I could be wrong but I think the picture looks better than the old one. It’s a good buy if you don’t have one. The smaller one is OK. I had the older version and it’s noticeably smaller but not worth it if you own one. AS FOR COD MW3: Pay attention to your essential schedule. I’ve lost hours to his game because its just so good. It looks good and takes advantage of HDR. So many different available things to do but for sure activision is trying to figure out how to get their money out of you. A good bundle.",
                "6": "Everything good. The dual sense controller is awesome. Nice graphics and basically there's no load times while playing. Never had a playstation console before, ps5 is amazing. The spiderman 2 voucher code worked. I would like a better packaging, nothing happened luckyly.",
                "7": "Pros:\n\nRendimiento potente: La PlayStation 5 cuenta con un procesador AMD Zen 2 y una GPU AMD RDNA 2, lo que le permite ofrecer una experiencia de juego de última generación con gráficos impresionantes y tiempos de carga rápidos.\nCompatibilidad con versiones anteriores: La PlayStation 5 es compatible con la mayoría de los juegos de PlayStation 4, lo que le permite disfrutar de una biblioteca de juegos más amplia.\nControles DualSense: Los controles DualSense de la PlayStation 5 ofrecen una experiencia de juego más inmersiva gracias a las funciones de retroalimentación háptica y gatillos adaptativos.\nJuegos exclusivos de PlayStation: La PlayStation 5 ofrece una variedad de juegos exclusivos de alta calidad, como Marvel's Spider-Man 2, God of War: Ragnarok y Horizon Forbidden West.\nContras:\n\nPrecio elevado: La PlayStation 5 es una consola de gama alta, por lo que su precio puede ser elevado para algunos usuarios.\nEscasez: La PlayStation 5 ha sido difícil de encontrar desde su lanzamiento, debido a la escasez de componentes.\nConclusiones:\n\nLa PlayStation 5 es una consola de juegos de última generación que ofrece un rendimiento potente, una amplia biblioteca de juegos y una experiencia de juego inmersiva.

                "11": " I bought this console for my wife's birthday because she saw it at Costco. Fortunately, her birthday is around Black Friday so Amazon had it on somewhat of a sale with Spider-Man. Few days later, it got delivered but we had a one week trip to Spain planned and she didn't get to open it. Sad face. The whole trip she kept talking about how excited she was to get back and setup the console to play. I literally married a child. Fast forward one week, we get back and the first thing she does is set up the ps5. According to her, the setup process was fairly easy. One thing we noticed is that the screen reader is default set to on. This was a bit annoying when you didn't expect it to be defaulted to on. A quick google search showed us how to disable it. Game play is super duper smooth but you need to make sure your HDMI cable is up to date as we originally used one from 2010 so the resolution was stuck at 1080. Graphics have come such a long way from my Xbox 360 days. Spider-Man's story line is fun to play along to and quite challenging. Wife is super happy that she has the ps5 now but I'm worried we're going to be spending a lot of money on games now. But, you know what they say, happy wife... (and that's it)",
                "12": "The PS5 box was fresh, still had the little tape seal at the top, the Call of duty MW3 Voucher was in there and does work. The only thing I didn’t like was the Amazon box they put the PS5 box in didn’t have a lot of cushion to protect it, but I mean the PS5 box already protects the PS5 pretty well.\n\nI also would recommend putting very specific instructions on how to find your address as they accidentally delivered it to my neighbors even if you live in a house and not an apartment just something to better identify your home.",
                "13": "The whole bundle came as advertised a brand new slim 2023 ps5 model with the removable disc drive, none of the marketing or descriptions disclosed that so i wasnt sure if this was the first model of ps5 or the new slim model that you can attach a disc derive to and it is indeed the new model with a modular drive. Copy of Spiderman 2 came with it as well as a download code, thats y only real \"comlaint\" i wish it was a game case with a disc but you cant complain for the price of the bundle you get a new revised slim version of the ps5 and a new game with it, i love the feel of the ps5 controller its way better than the ps4 controller. Biggest thing i've noticed is the console is absolutly silent to the point i have forgotten it was even on because my PC fans on low are louder than it. Overall a great console and a great bundle if you've been waiting to upgrade from ps4 as i have, this is the time you should take that chance to upgrade and now i can take full advantage of my 120hz 4K moniter so all in all this was a perfect bundle to buy as an early christmas present for yourself or someone else who's wanted to upgrade to the next generation consoles."

                        "1": "Like that it holds games and charges remotes and keeps system cool",
                        "2": "This ps5 stand has a lot of cool features. I like the charging options for the controllers and the multiple extra USB ports it comes with. The cooling feature is very subtle but it does give off a slight breeze. I also like that my ps5 feels more sturdy standing up in the stand. Overall happy to have this product and would gift it to anyone with a ps5",
                        "3": "Very good quality item for the ps5 . The ps5 fit perfect in the slots and so controllers have a spot too and best part it charges . It took like 2 hours to fully charge . It is not noisy at all. The stand is very good and strong . Everything looks way neater than before . I haven’t found any cons with it .",
                        "4": "This was a convenient and organized space for myPS5 and controllers while ensuring charging capabilities… But I dont recommend plugging it into the playstation… I say use your own power supply. The cooling function is particularly essential, aiding in the prevention of overheating issues often associated with the PS5 by sucking it out form the bottom as oppose to blowing it into the device ( avoid blowing dust inside the playstation at all cost). It helps maintain proper airflow and reduces dust build-up, promoting better performance. This stand comes highly recommended due to its effective and compact design.\nDespite the impressive appearance and efficient fan operation that functions silently, a few drawbacks were noted by users. Charging the controllers can be a bit problematic, allowing only one controller to charge effectively when the PS5 is off. Even when powered by an outlet, it limits charging to one controller (this must be due to trying to avoid heat build up and killing the device and or they used very cheap parts inside), displaying an error message on the second one. This restriction hampers efficient charging, as it only permits charging both controllers if the PS5 remains turned on.\nThe cooling system design might be a cause for concern, as some users were uncertain about its effectiveness and found the single tiny fan to be insufficient, considering its size. The warning notices in the manual about potential overloading of USB ports raise questions regarding the compatibility of using additional ports for charging and cooling the console simultaneously. The constraints in the power source options, especially the limitation to power the base solely from the PlayStation, add to the uncertainty. The lack of clarity in the charging instructions further confuses the users, giving an impression of uncertainty and inadequate electronic protection.\nWhile the cooling station offers a neat setup, uncertainties surrounding its design, functionality, and charging limitations might make users hesitant to fully embrace it.",
                        "5": "In 30+ years of gaming, I've always been a horizontal guy, always thinking that I wasn't a fan of having them vertical. Either due to look, or just not trusting it wouldn't fall over (or be knocked over by me or someone else), but that has changed.\n\nI am still going to keep some consoles horizontal, but this little baby made me decide to keep my PS5 vertical. It honestly actually even looks better sitting that way. The extra storage for games and controllers is a very nice feature that I think anyone will find value in. However, what we all want to have these types of things for is to keep our PS5s cool.\n\nI'm aminly an RPG gamer. That is to say, I tend to spend a lot of time in long gaming sessions, once just an hour shy of a full day (that was for a charity challenge on twitch but meaning still stands). My consoles have in the past doubled as a space heater let's just say. Not with this baby. It was cool to the touch after a 9 hour session on NG+ of FF16 (great game). It also was cool the entire time I was downloading my very large ps4/ps5 digital library, along with some psplus stuff, which took about a day and a half (and majority of a 5tb external).\n\nBottom line, get this. If it can convert me to going vertical, and make sure I don't knock over or burn out my ps5, then it is worth the money.",
                        "6": "Tried everything imaginable and my ps5 does not fit into this product. Not willing to break a new gaming console to make it work.",
                        "7": "This cooling system works great, it helps keep the playstation 5 from over heating and charges the wireless controllers when they aren't in use.. Our playstation was in a fairly roomy shelving system, but we were concerned that it might overheat and cause issues with the interior components... since Playstations aren't cheap, this device will do a great job of cooling..\n\nNot only does it work great it looks really cool as well.. I know I'd recommend this set up anytime, especially if you care about keeping your system working for years to come.. These newer systems aren't really made with longevity in mind, and do tend to get really hot, having the ability to cool your system as you game is paramount in keeping it up and running..",
                        "8": "I wanted to like this product so bad. It helps with helping my house look organized. But after a while, it did not charge my controllers. I’ve had this product for about 2 months and it doesn’t hold a charge.",
                        "9": "I'm honestly not sure if it's helping with the cooling or not, but at the very least it is keeping controllers and things charged and organized nicely.",
                        "10": "This looks really nice keeping all the PS5 items close and organized. Fan works well and you can't even hear it running. My only issue is that when the power goes through the PS5 it only.charges when turned on. However when you power via an outlet it will only allow me.to charge on controller the other blinks as in error which is frustrating so basically you can only charge one controller at a time unless you leave the PS5 on just to charge the controllers."

            "Product Reviews": {
                "1": "First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.",
                "2": "I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\n\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\n\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\n\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\n\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\n\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\n\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\n\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.",
                "3": "Always wanted to try VR but headsets were in the thousands of dollars the first many years. This thing comes along at just a few hundred dollars and can connect to your computer all the same to play the top games only limited by your own computer hardware. It’s wildly competitive!\n\nI rated this product 5 stars for perhaps the strangest reason I’ve had. After the first two weeks I barely touched this thing. It just sits gathering dust and I consider it a novelty. So why do I love it so much?\n\nThe experience that it provides is “of the future”. It made me laugh, giggle, and smile like a child in ways few products have. It ships with a free game that shows you everything VR can do in ~15 minutes and it was just so hilarious and impressive. That experience is so worth the full price even if it ends up on a shelf the week after.",

                "5": "This is an entry level VR headset and it's excellent for its price. I love it. There are quirks with it. Please mind that it was introduced to the market in late 2020 (so 3 years ago from this review) which is eons ago in tech space, so it's getting old, but I still love it.\n\nYes it's heavy, yes it works best when connected with a USB cable (for high FPS use), yes it's a little irritating to use generally because when in VR you have to interact with the world around you. So there's the learning curve. You need to invest time using this VR headset before submitting a review because things in VR are disorienting at the beginning -- think like the first time you used a trackball or a mouse.. took time to master.\n\nThat being said, I use it primarily for sim racing, it's comfortable, and it's absolutely incredible, so much that once you have the straps figured out properly and worked out the kinks, you can't tell it's even there. The sound that comes out of it is very immersive and good, the field of vision is excellent (I have one bad eye and I see 20/20 with the headset), I love the experience so much that I stopped using other sim racing games that don't support VR. I spend a lot of time on real race tracks in real life, and this VR headset allows me to spend time on the race track when it's raining out or when the season is over.\n\nBuy it, you won't regret it",
                "6": "I have absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this headset. It's fun and the fact that someone on my budget could afford it is really something. I wouldn't have had a VR set if it weren't for this being as affordable as it is. There are some shortcuts clearly taken to help keep it affordable but the actual VR hardware is amazing. Visuals are clear and immersive and it keeps up with my movements very well. If you don't have the money for something like an Index or Vive but want VR this is a great choice. It's also pretty sturdy. I've punched my table so hard my knuckles bled and the controller barely had a mark on it. You also can't tell I've headbutted my desk multiple times trying to pick up guns and rotwiener cores lol.\n\nLets get complaints out of the way first:\n• The original strap the headset came with is 100% the absolute worst part of the headset.\nDo yourself a favor and snag the Kiwi Design head strap while you're here on Amazon. The original strap squeezed the heck out of my head and if I loosened it the headset could flop around a bit causing blurry graphics and just being uncomfortable for a different reason. Due to that constant squeeze it gave me some nasty headaches usually after 2-3 hours of gameplay but sometimes much sooner and they could last the rest of the day. While they're nothing compared to a cluster headache for pain they were still what I'd consider bad.\n• Air link was awesome and worked great but was broken within a week of receiving the headset likely due to a patch (0.37 I think).\nI didn't get to enjoy it and the only potential bit of troubleshooting I have left to try as far as I've found is a factory reset which I'm reluctant to do. I bought a 3rd party link cable which is working well enough for me but I'd really like to be able to take my gaming to my living room where I have much less risk of punching or breaking anything and have some room to physically move around.\n• I don't really like having to be signed in with a Facebook account.\nI don't think this is going to change anytime soon if ever though.\n\nI've played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (H3VR), Blade & Sorcery, Pavlov, and Legendary Tales with my headset. I've played around 76 hours since I got it and aside from the headaches problem (which I've solved recently) it's been absolutely amazing and immersive. I've also used it to watch youtube, streaming shows, and movies. I absolutely love the thing for every use I've had for it so far. It's an absolute blast to experience actually fighting an opponent yourself whether it be that sniper in his tower or a bunch of knights. Just through the games themselves there's an amazing amount of stuff to experience but adding mods makes it even better. This headset can get your foot in the door to worlds you've always wanted to see in person at a pretty cheap price compared to it's competitors. Past video game levels, fantasy settings, all sorts of places to see and things to do.\n\nAn aspect you might have been thinking about is this is a great fitness tool even without dedicated fitness apps. Before you realize it you'll be sweaty and tired from swinging your arms, moving around, and holding your arms in front of you for surprisingly long periods of time. Pretty much anything you do with your VR will involve some level of activity and the gaming will almost certainly help kick your butt into shape. You should still visit the gym and make sure you're eating right though.\n\nI have only done gaming through PCVR and SteamVR. I have not tried any of the games for the headset on it's own nor do I expect to anytime soon. If you're looking for info on them then sorry but I can't help you with that.\n\nThere's several improvements I'd love to see either through future patches or future products. Probably the easiest would be the ability to verify and repair to latest patch the headset software from settings (if it's there I haven't found it). That way if my air link problem is software based I could fix it easily without having to do something like factory resetting the thing. If not then that's one more troubleshooting step I can cross off on my own fairly easily. In the next model or with an accessory if it's possible one thing I'd like is a second dedicated charge port allowing the use of a link cable and a charger with more oomph than a PC's USB 3 port would typically have for longer play times both at the same time. Another thing I'd like is a fabric cover. While the silicone cover is nice and stops the foam from irritating my face I'd love to have an official machine washable fabric facial interface cover that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.",
                "7": "I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I’d see if it was all I’d hoped it might be. Holy freakin’ crap!\n\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that’s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I’ve instructed it.\n\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I’m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I’m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I’m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn’t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\n\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I’ll be using like crazy.\n\nTonight I’m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it’s even better that I imagined. Best little toy I’ve bought myself in years.\n\nI did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing.

                "8": "This quest 2 is awesome. I bought my son one three years ago and he played with it daily. It just stopped working so I bought another.",
                "9": "Pros:\n- Fairly Immersive.\n- Amazing experiences.\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\n\nCons:\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.\n\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\n\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\n\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\n\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.",
                "10": "So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\n\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\n\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\n\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\n\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\n\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\n\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\n\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\n\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\n\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\n\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall."

                        "1": "Update: Six Weeks Later (Some Helpful Tips and Some Edits)\n\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\n\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\n\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else. But I pretty much never feel any discomfort at all.\n\nWhen adjusting the headset for the first time, the top strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be resting on your head. The most important adjustment is the headset arms because it determines how clear your vision will be. You want to adjust the the top strap and position of the headset interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. Then lastly, the back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I have mine pretty snug but there is no discomfort. For those who ever experience discomfort, it's probably because their headset arms are not at a good angle which causes all the pressure of the headset to be on the forehead which goes numb because of lack of blood flow.\n\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn't upgrade it, because I thought that it would make the headset lighter if they didn't upgrade it and I was worried about how heavy and uncomfortable the Quest 3 would be. But it's not at all heavy and it's very comfortable. Also, passthrough is everything to me now. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Eleven Table Tennis, and the Meta Quest Browser (for female hologram eye candy). Three is a free AR game called First Encounters that was fun to try and which I play on rare occasions. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\n\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\n\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have probably bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I want to keep installed for a while and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\n\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps like Virtual Desktop and Immersed when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general. I use it for when I am walking and indoor biking and sometimes when doing exercises like pushups and hamstring stretches.\n\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the Quest 3 wall charger and link cable that comes with the headset. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\n\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like only half an hour (or more).\n\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\n\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\n\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers since my router isn't that great.\n\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\n\nI like using Virtual Desktop for the virtual desktop. It's easy to grab and move the desktop around. It has a headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it lets you use your Quest controller to scroll and click on things. And it works in passthrough mode. I also like Immersed because you can have up to four virtual computer screens for free (five if you log in three times a week or pay for premium). Immersed allows you to be around other users and their avatars and it also has a passthrough mode. The only bad thing about Immersed is that it's not as easy to tilt and move the virtual desktop screens around, there is no headlock, and the Quest controllers are pretty much useless when interacting with the computer screens.\n\nZombie Games.... I started a game called Propagation: Paradise Hotel and it's a lot of fun and very interesting. Resident Evil 4 is also a good zombie VR game. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is a VR game or something but RE4 is fun to play. I like walking around the realistic setting. I like the scenery in RE4 better than the scenery in Arizona Sunshine and The Walking Dead. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners is also a decent zombie game. It's a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in TWD: S&S.\n\nOther Games.... I really liked the first Red Matter game. It was awesome. But sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value. I'm playing Red Matter 2, but so far I don't find it interesting. Genotype is a somewhat interesting game, but I feel like the texture resolutions aren't so great. Green Hell is an interesting realistic survival game so that is worth a try too. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game with crafting and you can even fish. I joined a Survival Nation server once and some guy came charging towards me and then started doing a lot of sign language, trying to get me to turn voice on, and trying to get me to complete 20 things at once so that I could be quickly caught up and start co-op'ng with him. That made me feel uncomfortable so then I started playing on solo mode. But after a while I got bored with solo mode. I want to be on the same server as other people but not feel pressured to co-op with them. I uninstalled it for now, but I might come back to it soon.\n\nFitness Games... I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\n\nCustom Launchers... I recommend getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher to help organize your games, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR games). (Increasing the resolution of games and your CPU/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, which isn't a problem for me since I am using an extension cord.) On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and the mirror that you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\n\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\n\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems. I mean some games are unbearably laggy and unplayable, but other games are playable. The important thing is that PCVR is an option for me and works most of the time, even though I have a weak laptop.\n\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 70% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people from trying the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much? I'm already looking forward to the Quest 4 because I hope it will have even better passthrough and better resolution.",
                        "2": "I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\n\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\n\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\n\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\n\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\n\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\n\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\n\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\n\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\n\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\n\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!",
                        "3": "Simply put I was blown away by the technology. The visuals are generally sharp and crisp and are pretty mind blowing. Even just navigating the menu screens is a joy, and the fact that it registers hand input is insane. The controllers feel good and snappy and intuitive.\n\nBut the apps just still aren't there overall. The selection of games is still just not quite there to justify this to 'everybody', and it is still far too hard to do simple things like play 3D movies or easily navigate the web to make this a must recommend. It is also still relatively heavy on the face (though improved from previous generations). The battery life is short at 2 hours but you probably won't want to play for that long anyway given the above. The pass through is.. passable but you won't be wanting to read any screens through it and it is definitely grainy. It is also unfathomable to me why they chose to ship this without a nasal piece to block the light coming in from the bottom.\n\nIn short, it's the best to come so far and this tech is definitely the future, but the technology still has quite a ways to go.",
                        "4": "First off, I'll say that i just got this and am still testing. But so far, I am super impressed. I own an original vive that I bought day 1 and then i got a reverb g2 that I have been using until the quest 3. Both if my previous headsets were corded, limited to one area of the house, and a pain to setup and use when I wanted to play. I was using light houses as well on the reverb g2 so that I could still use my better tracking vive wands. All of it was limiting and a pain which made me end up not playing. The Quest 3 was the solution I had been waiting for!\n\nBeing able to do room setup in headset quick and easy is a dream come true. I was skeptical about the wireless capability for pcvr as well but I am blown away at how well it has worked so far. I've been able to play pcvr games anywhere in my house which is amazing.\n\nThe pancake lenses are so much better than the fresnek lenses also. I wear glasses, and the quest 3 works well with my glasses out of the box, although I do want to get some lens inserts later.\n\nEverything seems very polished with a minimal amount of bugs. The AR pass through which it is somewhat grainy and not super clear, it's fun and works very well. The sound is pretty amazing also for the type do speakers it has.. Not enough bass in beatsaber and it can't compare to the g2 style of speakers but very impressive for what they are.\n\nControllers feel nice and not cheap, track well, battery life on the controllers is good. The headset itself looks and feels pretty good. I think they should have put a nose flap on it because the only place I have lightleak is at the bottom of the nose area. The strap of course is everyone's gripe.. Yes, it isn't great.. But tbh it isn't as uncomfortable as what everyone keeps saying to me. It works but it just isn't the best.\n\nMy one issue, aside from this being released by a company I don't like, is that they want to nickle and dime everyone for things that they should have included with the headset or to fix issues with the headset.\n\nThe headset battery life is about 2 hours. That isn't long... So they sell an overpriced better elite headstrap with an extra battery to extend it to 4 hours I think. Fixes two issues by making you pay more money. Fortunately, there are plenty of aftermarket options for battery extenders and straps that are cheaper, so you don't have to spend more money on meta's overpriced accessories.\n\nI've seen reports of people getting headsets with dead pixels and there being quality control issues... So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels.. Im a stickler for that stuff cause my vive had a dead pixel and it always bothered me. I'll be checking closely to make sure the quest 3 is good.\n\nI was going to take one star off for meta nickle and diming but the headset is so good that I won't do that as of now. This may change later but it's simply the best, most versatile, most polished VR headset you can get right now for this price. I guess they kept the price down by giving a crappy strap, smaller battery, etc.",
                        "5": "I bought the Quest 2 when it came out and was disappointed with the difficulty to maintain a good focus through both eyes, the wear on my face even after short-term use, the battery life, the overall performance (freezing, hitching , and delays while doing simple things was common), and the general lack of 3rd party support. The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don't accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn't randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!\n\nIt's still not perfect, and here's the bad so far:\n- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.\n- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you're really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn't ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.\n- I've heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I've played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there's still no dedicated app) with no issues.\n- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \"competitor\" platforms and services.\n- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it's clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn't normally a sudden change in color/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.\n- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.\n\nIf you're still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it's still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.",
                        "6": "I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.",
                        "7": "I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\n\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\n\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\n\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!",
                        "8": "I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\n\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \"rug burn\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone♡",
                        "9": "So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\n\n- The clarity of the new \"pancake\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\n\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\n\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\n\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\n\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\n\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\n\nThe comfort\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\n\nBattery life\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\n\nPCVR\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\n\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.",
                        "10": "Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\n\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR¹, thus far the native apps aren’t of interest] and didn’t use it as much as I’d expected.² With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I’ve ZERO regrets.\n\n😺 Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\n\n😻 Lenses: WOW!\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2’s Fresnel lenses and the Q3’s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the “sweet-spot” is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\n\n😺 Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I’m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\n\n😿 Contrast: comparable\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\n\n😻 Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. 😬😬😬😬\n\n😻 IPD settings: significantly improved\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\n\n😐 Controllers: neutral\nI liked the rings on the Q2’s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3’s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\n\nThings I’ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I’ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\n• battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n• sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n• eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\n• native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\n\nOverall: while I’m sad there weren’t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it’s a still terrific bargain. It’s a shame about the contrast though 😹\n\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn’t have wifi enabled and couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\n_____\n¹ — For PCVR I’m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta’s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I’ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I’ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop’s “HVEC 10-bit” encoder, which graphically is better than the plain “HVEC” encoder, also has a lower latency!]\n\n² — Considering the price I paid vis-à-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset."

                "1": "I have been a gammer all my life, have owned almost every console since the Atari Pong all the way till the Ps4 and Switch, but I have skipped most Xbox' s except for the original that was given to me as a gift.\nThis new console that Microsoft has made is in my opinion the absolute best in this generation. Spec-wise it cannot be beat and if superior to the PS5 I most respects. But when you use your series X and in conjunction with Game Pass Ultimate (GPU), it simply becomes the hands down, no questions asked, absolute BEST VALUE in gaming anywhere! Today Microsoft has also teamed up their GPU service with EA, and now we can get most sports games and most EA titles included in GPU. But you must also add the future inclusion of Bethesda and all their amazing titles from day one in GUP since MS has bought them out.\nSo how can't you go wrong with the MOST POWERFUL CONSOLE EVER MADE and the potential of including GPU to make it the best value in gaming PERIOD.\n\nYes some will think that their are few titles specifically made for this new generation as of this writing, but the same goes for Playstation, and Sony changed their mind in the short term, as most titles that they have as great exclusives are also being released for the foreseeable future on PS4 as well as PS5.\n\nPROS:\n- Best Value in gaming when used with Game Pass Ultimate.\n- Most powerful console ever made (12TFLOPS - 52 CU's).\n- Intuitive and very functional OS.\n- Great games even for this generation like: Medium.\n- FPS Boos feature for older games.\n- Automatic HDR for older games.\n- Instant Resume feature is just awesome!\n- Great controls, I thought I would not like them, BUT THEY ARE GREAT!\n- Minimalistic design, that goes well with anything you have already.\n- QUIET there is no noticeable sound of fans even when gaming for hours.\n- More available space in internal drive then PS5.\n\nCONS:\n- Controllers use a AA Battery... WHY would you do this in 2021? Yes there are options, but I should not need to look for options, personally for now I went the rechargeable Energizer route, but it is a hassle that should not be present in a console this generation.\n- No gimmicks and straightforward pure power, no you don't get resistance in the adaptive triggers like a PS5, makes it feel a bit less futuristic.\n- Had a bug happen to me more then once while purchasing new games, got an error, so for workaround had to add to cart, go to billing address, put edit, select the same billing address and then it worked, very annoying.\n\nSPECS:\n- Processor: 8-core AMD Ryzen Zen 2-architecture CPU at 3.8GHz (3.6GHz with SMT)\n- Graphics: AMD Navi/RDNA 2-family GPU with 52 CU at 1.825GHz (12TFLOPS FP32)\n- Video:16GB GDDR6 with 14Gbps 320-bit interface (10GB at 560GB/s allocated to GPU, 6GB at 336GB/s allocated to rest of system with 3.5GB for GPU)\n- Die Size: 360.45 mm2\n- Process: 7nm Enhanced\n- Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w/ 320mb bus\n- Memory Bandwidth: 10 GB @ 560 GB/s, 6GB @ 336 GB/s\n- Internal Storage: 1 TB Custom NVME SSD\n- I/O Throughput: 2.4 GB/s (Raw), 4.8 GB/s (Compressed, with custom hardware decompression block)\n- Expandable Storage: 1 TB Expansion Card - Seagate ATM only avail.\n- External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD - WB Black Gaming 5TB what I got for it.\n- Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive-\n- Performance: 4K @ 60 FPS, up to 4K @ 120 FPS, 8K @ 60 FPS\n- Size: 301mm x 151mm x 151mm\n\nFinally, I will recommend this console over the the PS5, its simply a BEAST and a better value when teamed with GPU. I won't get a Ps5 for the foreseeable future at least not till late 2022, since by then they might really have PS5 exclusives that don't get. a PS4 version.\nThe Xbox Series X is such a great console that you would be hard pressed to look it over over the hype that the Ps5 has generated because of its lack of availability. So if you like simply the best console this generation and wish to get the best bang for your buck, Xbox Series X simply rocks.\n\nPRO+ : The Xbox series X is also an amazing emulation system, it can run Retroarch with no hacks, with nothing weird, just look it up in YouTube and you will find tutorials. But it can do emulation like very few systems and it add to its tremendous lineup and value.\n\nGreat job Microsoft, you not only added a customer, but a new fan.",
                "2": "Step into the realm of gaming greatness with the Xbox Series X, the Hercules of consoles – muscular, powerful, and ready to elevate your gaming experience to celestial heights! Assembling this gaming marvel was simpler than beating level one of a classic arcade game. Unbox, plug in, power up, and voila! I was transported into a world of immersive gaming splendor.\n\nLet's talk power, folks! With a whopping 1TB SSD, it's like having a storage vault for every gaming adventure imaginable. The 16GB RAM felt like having a brain that processes game data quicker than a cheetah chasing its prey. The console revved up like a finely tuned sports car, promising gaming speeds faster than my cat chasing a laser pointer.\n\nThe promise of true 4K gaming sent shivers down my spine. The graphics were so sharp, I could almost see the pixels having a party! And with up to 120 frames per second, it's like watching a movie in fast-forward, only it's your gameplay and not a rom-com.\n\nThe Wireless Controller is like an extension of your own hand – sleek, comfortable, and responsive. It's like having a magic wand (minus the spells, but hey, your gaming skills might feel magical).\n\nThe Velocity Architecture? It's like having a gaming time machine, reducing loading times to mere blips on the screen. I blinked, and suddenly, I was in the midst of epic battles without the agony of waiting.\n\nHowever, even this gaming behemoth has its kryptonite. The only downside? The wallet might feel a bit lighter after acquiring this gaming beast. But fear not, for the hours of gaming joy it provides will make you forget about those dollar signs faster than a high-speed race in Forza Horizon.\n\nNow, maneuverability? Let's be real – this console isn't going anywhere. It's like a monolith, firmly rooted in your gaming universe. But who needs maneuverability when you're anchored in a realm of gaming nirvana?\n\nIn conclusion, the Xbox Series X is a titan among gaming consoles, a symphony of power, graphics, and sheer gaming delight. It's a gaming paradise that turns button-mashing into a delightful symphony of pixels. So, grab this console, embrace your inner gaming legend, and embark on gaming adventures that'll leave you shouting \"Achievement Unlocked!\" like a boss!",
                "3": "I bought this for Christmas for my son and we love it. It’s very user friendly and the graphics are wonderful. The package it came in was fun and very professional! Downloading disc games can take a while sometimes, but the system is fantastic! I absolutely adore the backwards compatibility!!! Absolute favorite feature for sure! This was the main selling point for me when I was looking into a new console to buy. I didn’t see the point in buying a PS5 if I couldn’t play the PS3 games that I currently have from my older system. At least with the Xbox series X I can still play the 360 games that I have and even buy more 360 games if I want! The memory is outstanding as well! Xbox also has a family settings app so I can keep up with the games my son is playing and how much time he logs on his system, as well as any messages from “friends.” Definitely worth the money in my opinion. Family friendly. User friendly. Just amazing. Keep up the good work Xbox!",
                "4": "Xbox Series X! The graphics are amazing, and it runs games smoothly. The quick load times are a game-changer, and the Game Pass library is a fantastic value. The library of games if compared to previous generations has been slightly disappointing but are starting to pick up. Xbox exclusive titles are great along with backward compatibility (select Xbox, 360, One games) provides a wide range of gaming options. However, the console's large size might be a concern for some users as I did not have any room on my current tv stand. Overall, it's a top-tier gaming system for both casual and hardcore gamers.",
                "5": "I love this console. Between the full backwards compatibility, the semi compact size, and the amazing performance, it's a great bang for buck! Much more performance than a similarly priced PC. Everything is smooth. Really worth the upgrade from an Xbox one.",
                "6": "Been wanting to upgrade my Xbox since this was announced. Finally was able to. Already opened up a couple games and was NOT expecting for them to load SO fast and to look SO clear and beautiful! So happy with this purchase!",
                "7": "Very simple to set up and transfer from an Xbox One and felt the difference between next-gen. It's very helpful in showing what your setup can and can't do. At $399.99, the Series X is worth it.",
                "8": "This here Xbox Series X console, is the best of the best!!!! High speed power, 120 FPS, gaming power to the max!!!! Such a great purchase, I will purchase again in the near future for accessories!! Thank you Amazon for your amazing support on this product. I couldn’t thank you enough for the support.",
                "9": "Delivery was fast, 2 days. Box was well packaged, sealed Xbox x.\nSet up was simple, even for me. You just use your phone to set it up. I had a quick issue where the code that was sent wasn’t working, so wasn’t sure if it was the code, or something incorrect with my email/password. At that point, the Xbox wouldn’t let me power off using the controller, so I manually turned it off, waited a couple minutes, started again, restarted the “new console” set up, new code that worked, and before I knew it, I was at the Home Screen.\nNo noticeable cosmetic or technical issues. This is definitely a nice upgrade from Xbox one.\nLove premium game pass, and the user interface is similar to Xbox one. Controller provided takes double A’s, so will buy another one with a bit more quality without dealing with batteries.\nI used the disc drive, it works which is great, my old Xbox one blue Ray drive stopped working a couple years ago.\nI will give an update after more use and game play, but initially, very happy to have this. I’ve held out a long time for one of these! Worth the wait!\nUPDATE: Xbox X is great. Blu-ray drive works, love the quick resume option for games. Format is familiar like Xbox One, so not a lot of changes on the Home Screen and such. No issues playing games, watching movies, etc. very much like having this. Fun for everyone! Graphic updates are nice, however, if your using an older TV you prob won’t see too much difference. Highly recommend if your still on the fence about purchasing.",
                "10": "So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box? Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.\n\nYou open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it's in a treasure chest. It was great! I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console. So good job on that!\n\nI'm upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade. I've got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it! I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.\n\nAnd here it is.\n\nVisually speaking, I'm not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S. There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren't there before. Everything is less fuzzy. So that's good. It's just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES. Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2. But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One. The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me. I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I'm playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.\n\nAnd that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games. While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn't anything on the Xbox that can't be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility). With Halo Infinite being delayed, there's no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.\n\nWell... I SAY that but I also don't regret doing so. I'm disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice. And it isn't even the best part of the Series X. That would be the load times. With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast. I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done. This thing zips along. That also applies while you're in the game. Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly. There's a lot of power in this rectangular box. The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it's not a selling feature if you're comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.\n\nIt's a lot of the \"under-the-hood\" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One. The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox's back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you'll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren't brand new exclusives. I've got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now. If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service. I spent my first day just downloading everything I'm going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.\n\nAnd, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass. You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X. It's a good deal.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase. I wish Halo would have made launch. I'm also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it's worth playing. But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable. In the end, it comes down to where your friends are. Mine are on Xbox so here I am. This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I'm going to regret having it a year or so down the line.\n\nBut if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don't really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season. Miles Morales looks really good.\n\nBut if Sony's exclusives don't move you, the third party games are all multiplatform. You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin's Creeds on whatever console you manage to get. In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there's enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.\n\nOh! This thing also has a controller! It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller. This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version. There's a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch. So Microsoft is a little behind but it's here now! I have not used it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it.\n\nAnyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware. This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time. Day one, you know what you're getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.\n\nBut, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)"

                "1": "Update: Six Weeks Later (Some Helpful Tips and Some Edits)\n\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\n\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\n\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else. But I pretty much never feel any discomfort at all.\n\nWhen adjusting the headset for the first time, the top strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be resting on your head. The most important adjustment is the headset arms because it determines how clear your vision will be. You want to adjust the the top strap and position of the headset interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. Then lastly, the back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I have mine pretty snug but there is no discomfort. For those who ever experience discomfort, it's probably because their headset arms are not at a good angle which causes all the pressure of the headset to be on the forehead which goes numb because of lack of blood flow.\n\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn't upgrade it, because I thought that it would make the headset lighter if they didn't upgrade it and I was worried about how heavy and uncomfortable the Quest 3 would be. But it's not at all heavy and it's very comfortable. Also, passthrough is everything to me now. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Eleven Table Tennis, and the Meta Quest Browser (for female hologram eye candy). Three is a free AR game called First Encounters that was fun to try and which I play on rare occasions. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\n\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\n\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have probably bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I want to keep installed for a while and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\n\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps like Virtual Desktop and Immersed when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general. I use it for when I am walking and indoor biking and sometimes when doing exercises like pushups and hamstring stretches.\n\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the Quest 3 wall charger and link cable that comes with the headset. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\n\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like only half an hour (or more).\n\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\n\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\n\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers since my router isn't that great.\n\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\n\nI like using Virtual Desktop for the virtual desktop. It's easy to grab and move the desktop around. It has a headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it lets you use your Quest controller to scroll and click on things. And it works in passthrough mode. I also like Immersed because you can have up to four virtual computer screens for free (five if you log in three times a week or pay for premium). Immersed allows you to be around other users and their avatars and it also has a passthrough mode. The only bad thing about Immersed is that it's not as easy to tilt and move the virtual desktop screens around, there is no headlock, and the Quest controllers are pretty much useless when interacting with the computer screens.\n\nZombie Games.... I started a game called Propagation: Paradise Hotel and it's a lot of fun and very interesting. Resident Evil 4 is also a good zombie VR game. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is a VR game or something but RE4 is fun to play. I like walking around the realistic setting. I like the scenery in RE4 better than the scenery in Arizona Sunshine and The Walking Dead. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners is also a decent zombie game. It's a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in TWD: S&S.\n\nOther Games.... I really liked the first Red Matter game. It was awesome. But sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value. I'm playing Red Matter 2, but so far I don't find it interesting. Genotype is a somewhat interesting game, but I feel like the texture resolutions aren't so great. Green Hell is an interesting realistic survival game so that is worth a try too. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game with crafting and you can even fish. I joined a Survival Nation server once and some guy came charging towards me and then started doing a lot of sign language, trying to get me to turn voice on, and trying to get me to complete 20 things at once so that I could be quickly caught up and start co-op'ng with him. That made me feel uncomfortable so then I started playing on solo mode. But after a while I got bored with solo mode. I want to be on the same server as other people but not feel pressured to co-op with them. I uninstalled it for now, but I might come back to it soon.\n\nFitness Games... I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\n\nCustom Launchers... I recommend getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher to help organize your games, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR games). (Increasing the resolution of games and your CPU/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, which isn't a problem for me since I am using an extension cord.) On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and the mirror that you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\n\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\n\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems. I mean some games are unbearably laggy and unplayable, but other games are playable. The important thing is that PCVR is an option for me and works most of the time, even though I have a weak laptop.\n\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 70% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people from trying the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much? I'm already looking forward to the Quest 4 because I hope it will have even better passthrough and better resolution.",
                "2": "I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\n\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\n\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\n\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\n\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\n\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\n\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\n\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\n\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\n\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\n\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!",
                "3": "Simply put I was blown away by the technology. The visuals are generally sharp and crisp and are pretty mind blowing. Even just navigating the menu screens is a joy, and the fact that it registers hand input is insane. The controllers feel good and snappy and intuitive.\n\nBut the apps just still aren't there overall. The selection of games is still just not quite there to justify this to 'everybody', and it is still far too hard to do simple things like play 3D movies or easily navigate the web to make this a must recommend. It is also still relatively heavy on the face (though improved from previous generations). The battery life is short at 2 hours but you probably won't want to play for that long anyway given the above. The pass through is.. passable but you won't be wanting to read any screens through it and it is definitely grainy. It is also unfathomable to me why they chose to ship this without a nasal piece to block the light coming in from the bottom.\n\nIn short, it's the best to come so far and this tech is definitely the future, but the technology still has quite a ways to go.",
                "4": "First off, I'll say that i just got this and am still testing. But so far, I am super impressed. I own an original vive that I bought day 1 and then i got a reverb g2 that I have been using until the quest 3. Both if my previous headsets were corded, limited to one area of the house, and a pain to setup and use when I wanted to play. I was using light houses as well on the reverb g2 so that I could still use my better tracking vive wands. All of it was limiting and a pain which made me end up not playing. The Quest 3 was the solution I had been waiting for!\n\nBeing able to do room setup in headset quick and easy is a dream come true. I was skeptical about the wireless capability for pcvr as well but I am blown away at how well it has worked so far. I've been able to play pcvr games anywhere in my house which is amazing.\n\nThe pancake lenses are so much better than the fresnek lenses also. I wear glasses, and the quest 3 works well with my glasses out of the box, although I do want to get some lens inserts later.\n\nEverything seems very polished with a minimal amount of bugs. The AR pass through which it is somewhat grainy and not super clear, it's fun and works very well. The sound is pretty amazing also for the type do speakers it has.. Not enough bass in beatsaber and it can't compare to the g2 style of speakers but very impressive for what they are.\n\nControllers feel nice and not cheap, track well, battery life on the controllers is good. The headset itself looks and feels pretty good. I think they should have put a nose flap on it because the only place I have lightleak is at the bottom of the nose area. The strap of course is everyone's gripe.. Yes, it isn't great.. But tbh it isn't as uncomfortable as what everyone keeps saying to me. It works but it just isn't the best.\n\nMy one issue, aside from this being released by a company I don't like, is that they want to nickle and dime everyone for things that they should have included with the headset or to fix issues with the headset.\n\nThe headset battery life is about 2 hours. That isn't long... So they sell an overpriced better elite headstrap with an extra battery to extend it to 4 hours I think. Fixes two issues by making you pay more money. Fortunately, there are plenty of aftermarket options for battery extenders and straps that are cheaper, so you don't have to spend more money on meta's overpriced accessories.\n\nI've seen reports of people getting headsets with dead pixels and there being quality control issues... So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels.. Im a stickler for that stuff cause my vive had a dead pixel and it always bothered me. I'll be checking closely to make sure the quest 3 is good.\n\nI was going to take one star off for meta nickle and diming but the headset is so good that I won't do that as of now. This may change later but it's simply the best, most versatile, most polished VR headset you can get right now for this price. I guess they kept the price down by giving a crappy strap, smaller battery, etc.",
                "5": "I bought the Quest 2 when it came out and was disappointed with the difficulty to maintain a good focus through both eyes, the wear on my face even after short-term use, the battery life, the overall performance (freezing, hitching , and delays while doing simple things was common), and the general lack of 3rd party support. The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don't accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn't randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!\n\nIt's still not perfect, and here's the bad so far:\n- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.\n- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you're really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn't ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.\n- I've heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I've played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there's still no dedicated app) with no issues.\n- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \"competitor\" platforms and services.\n- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it's clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn't normally a sudden change in color/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.\n- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.\n\nIf you're still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it's still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.",
                "6": "I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.",
                "7": "I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\n\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\n\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\n\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!",
                "8": "I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\n\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \"rug burn\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone♡",
                "9": "So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\n\n- The clarity of the new \"pancake\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\n\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\n\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\n\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\n\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\n\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\n\nThe comfort\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\n\nBattery life\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\n\nPCVR\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\n\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.",
                "10": "Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\n\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR¹, thus far the native apps aren’t of interest] and didn’t use it as much as I’d expected.² With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I’ve ZERO regrets.\n\n😺 Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\n\n😻 Lenses: WOW!\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2’s Fresnel lenses and the Q3’s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the “sweet-spot” is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\n\n😺 Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I’m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\n\n😿 Contrast: comparable\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\n\n😻 Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. 😬😬😬😬\n\n😻 IPD settings: significantly improved\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\n\n😐 Controllers: neutral\nI liked the rings on the Q2’s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3’s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\n\nThings I’ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I’ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\n• battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n• sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\n• eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\n• native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\n\nOverall: while I’m sad there weren’t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it’s a still terrific bargain. It’s a shame about the contrast though 😹\n\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn’t have wifi enabled and couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\n_____\n¹ — For PCVR I’m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta’s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I’ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I’ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop’s “HVEC 10-bit” encoder, which graphically is better than the plain “HVEC” encoder, also has a lower latency!]\n\n² — Considering the price I paid vis-à-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset."

                        "1": "First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.",
                        "2": "I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\n\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\n\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\n\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\n\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\n\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\n\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\n\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.",
                        "3": "Always wanted to try VR but headsets were in the thousands of dollars the first many years. This thing comes along at just a few hundred dollars and can connect to your computer all the same to play the top games only limited by your own computer hardware. It’s wildly competitive!\n\nI rated this product 5 stars for perhaps the strangest reason I’ve had. After the first two weeks I barely touched this thing. It just sits gathering dust and I consider it a novelty. So why do I love it so much?\n\nThe experience that it provides is “of the future”. It made me laugh, giggle, and smile like a child in ways few products have. It ships with a free game that shows you everything VR can do in ~15 minutes and it was just so hilarious and impressive. That experience is so worth the full price even if it ends up on a shelf the week after.",

                        "5": "This is an entry level VR headset and it's excellent for its price. I love it. There are quirks with it. Please mind that it was introduced to the market in late 2020 (so 3 years ago from this review) which is eons ago in tech space, so it's getting old, but I still love it.\n\nYes it's heavy, yes it works best when connected with a USB cable (for high FPS use), yes it's a little irritating to use generally because when in VR you have to interact with the world around you. So there's the learning curve. You need to invest time using this VR headset before submitting a review because things in VR are disorienting at the beginning -- think like the first time you used a trackball or a mouse.. took time to master.\n\nThat being said, I use it primarily for sim racing, it's comfortable, and it's absolutely incredible, so much that once you have the straps figured out properly and worked out the kinks, you can't tell it's even there. The sound that comes out of it is very immersive and good, the field of vision is excellent (I have one bad eye and I see 20/20 with the headset), I love the experience so much that I stopped using other sim racing games that don't support VR. I spend a lot of time on real race tracks in real life, and this VR headset allows me to spend time on the race track when it's raining out or when the season is over.\n\nBuy it, you won't regret it",
                        "6": "I have absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this headset. It's fun and the fact that someone on my budget could afford it is really something. I wouldn't have had a VR set if it weren't for this being as affordable as it is. There are some shortcuts clearly taken to help keep it affordable but the actual VR hardware is amazing. Visuals are clear and immersive and it keeps up with my movements very well. If you don't have the money for something like an Index or Vive but want VR this is a great choice. It's also pretty sturdy. I've punched my table so hard my knuckles bled and the controller barely had a mark on it. You also can't tell I've headbutted my desk multiple times trying to pick up guns and rotwiener cores lol.\n\nLets get complaints out of the way first:\n• The original strap the headset came with is 100% the absolute worst part of the headset.\nDo yourself a favor and snag the Kiwi Design head strap while you're here on Amazon. The original strap squeezed the heck out of my head and if I loosened it the headset could flop around a bit causing blurry graphics and just being uncomfortable for a different reason. Due to that constant squeeze it gave me some nasty headaches usually after 2-3 hours of gameplay but sometimes much sooner and they could last the rest of the day. While they're nothing compared to a cluster headache for pain they were still what I'd consider bad.\n• Air link was awesome and worked great but was broken within a week of receiving the headset likely due to a patch (0.37 I think).\nI didn't get to enjoy it and the only potential bit of troubleshooting I have left to try as far as I've found is a factory reset which I'm reluctant to do. I bought a 3rd party link cable which is working well enough for me but I'd really like to be able to take my gaming to my living room where I have much less risk of punching or breaking anything and have some room to physically move around.\n• I don't really like having to be signed in with a Facebook account.\nI don't think this is going to change anytime soon if ever though.\n\nI've played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (H3VR), Blade & Sorcery, Pavlov, and Legendary Tales with my headset. I've played around 76 hours since I got it and aside from the headaches problem (which I've solved recently) it's been absolutely amazing and immersive. I've also used it to watch youtube, streaming shows, and movies. I absolutely love the thing for every use I've had for it so far. It's an absolute blast to experience actually fighting an opponent yourself whether it be that sniper in his tower or a bunch of knights. Just through the games themselves there's an amazing amount of stuff to experience but adding mods makes it even better. This headset can get your foot in the door to worlds you've always wanted to see in person at a pretty cheap price compared to it's competitors. Past video game levels, fantasy settings, all sorts of places to see and things to do.\n\nAn aspect you might have been thinking about is this is a great fitness tool even without dedicated fitness apps. Before you realize it you'll be sweaty and tired from swinging your arms, moving around, and holding your arms in front of you for surprisingly long periods of time. Pretty much anything you do with your VR will involve some level of activity and the gaming will almost certainly help kick your butt into shape. You should still visit the gym and make sure you're eating right though.\n\nI have only done gaming through PCVR and SteamVR. I have not tried any of the games for the headset on it's own nor do I expect to anytime soon. If you're looking for info on them then sorry but I can't help you with that.\n\nThere's several improvements I'd love to see either through future patches or future products. Probably the easiest would be the ability to verify and repair to latest patch the headset software from settings (if it's there I haven't found it). That way if my air link problem is software based I could fix it easily without having to do something like factory resetting the thing. If not then that's one more troubleshooting step I can cross off on my own fairly easily. In the next model or with an accessory if it's possible one thing I'd like is a second dedicated charge port allowing the use of a link cable and a charger with more oomph than a PC's USB 3 port would typically have for longer play times both at the same time. Another thing I'd like is a fabric cover. While the silicone cover is nice and stops the foam from irritating my face I'd love to have an official machine washable fabric facial interface cover that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.",
                        "7": "I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I’d see if it was all I’d hoped it might be. Holy freakin’ crap!\n\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that’s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I’ve instructed it.\n\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I’m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I’m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I’m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn’t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\n\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I’ll be using like crazy.\n\nTonight I’m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it’s even better that I imagined.

Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\n\nCons:\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.\n\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\n\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\n\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\n\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.",
                        "10": "So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\n\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\n\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\n\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\n\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\n\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\n\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\n\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\n\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\n\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\n\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall."

                        "1": "This is an excellent case for your new Nintendo Switch. I ordered it the day it was put on Amazon for an amazingly low price, so I did not have high expectations, but I am happily surprised at the high quality of this case. The case is hard enough to fully protect your Nintendo Switch, yet flexible enough to fit in bags and carry everywhere with you. The case has nice little rubber handle and zips shut. There is no zipper on the inside of the case.\n\nInside you will find it is lined with a soft microfiber. There is a mesh pocket on the top that goes about 3/4 of the way up and holds a ton of stuff. The bottom of the case has a double sided flap. The top holds 8 cartridges and the bottom is padded to fully protect your Nintendo switch screen. The bottom of the case is form molded to hold your Nintendo Switch perfectly and even has loose fitting elastic on each side to help secure it in place. I originally bought the officially licensed Tough Pouch, but much prefer this one. They are almost identical in size and appear to be made about the same way. The pouch is a fraction thinner and does not have a handle. It has almost the same inside except not as useful. The flap that protects the screen is sewn at the top and does not fully protect the screen on the touch pouch, where this one is on the bottom and fully protects the screen. The Orzly case holds 8 games and accessories and the tough pouch only holds the switch and 5 cartridges. Another thing I love about this case is that it is simple and black. There is no advertising on it anywhere and no way for thieves to know you are carrying an brand new Video Game Console.\n\nPlease see photos for more details and please excuse the crappy screen protector I have on the Switch in these pics. The 5th picture shows the Orzly pouch on top and the Tough Pouch on the bottom for size comparison.\n\nHighlights:\n* Holds 8 cartridges or micro SD cards\n* Large Mesh Pouch can hold all cords, chargers, or an accessory. I even fit 2 entire game cases in the pouch!\n* Large soft screen protector sewn into case.\n* Handle for carrying the case.\n* Lightweight, yet strong and durable.\n* The Soft, microfiber interior protects your console and controllers from everyday wear and tear, bumps and scrapes.\n\nThis case is well worth the $25 it retails for and the case I compared it to is currently selling for $40! Only issue I had was that it was sent in a bubble mailer, so the outside box was crushed. This would be a problem if it were a gift, but it did not affect the actual product in any way.",
                        "2": "After spending big bucks on my Granddaughters Nintendo Switch I realized “Holy Cow” I bought nothing to protect it!! She is only 8 and walks around with it and uses it in the car. When I drop my cell phone I am always glad I have a case! I immediately ordered this one and it’s perfect, a safe place for everything and a sturdy handle for on the go! Not expensive and she always uses it!",
                        "3": "When I'm spending the weekend out of town, I use a nice, big carrying case the can hold the whole system set up. That's great for a whole weekend, but when I'm going to be stuck someplace boring for an evening or just a few hours, now I can take what I need to stave off boredom without having to carry everything I own. This case is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about breaking anything and roomy enough to hold extra controllers, cords, games, or anything else I can't live without. And it still fits in my purse. Great product!",
                        "4": "Overall the product is great. However, one of the complaints I have is that whenever you try to put in the Joy Con Grip in the case, the cause becomes extremely bulky, and it causes me to worry that if ever drop the case that it might crack my switch's screen. Also, obviously you can't put an elite controller in the case which sucks because you either need a separate bag or you have to carry it in your hand. Otherwise the case is EXTREMELY good, the bands that hold the switch is great, the pockets that hold small accessories are amazing (it can hold the charger and extra joy cons), and the zipper & sturdiness of the case is phenomenal. Therefore, I would highly recommend getting this case even if it is on the pricier side.",
                        "5": "This carrier for the Nintendo Switch is really nice. It holds everything it needs and honestly, the quality is great. For as many times as this thing gets opened, the zipper appears to be holding strong. I'm happy with this purchase.",
                        "6": "Fits switch perfectly and it’s accessories. Good, sturdy case",
                        "7": "I wanted something I could bring my switch with me on travel, Just drop it in my bag and forget about it. So far I've used this case on a couple of trips and it's been great. It's not too bulky, but it does its job well. Plenty of room to store a charger or whatever you would like.",
                        "8": "This case is durable and holds my switch plus a variety of different games and other msc items.",
                        "9": "Love using this case for traveling with my switch. It can hold many games as well. Strongly recommend if you’re looking to get a traveling case for your switch!!",
                        "10": "Es plastico duro y se ve muy duradero, perfecto para su uso.",
