And that\\'s it. That\\'s the extent of my cons list.\\n\\nThe good: outrageously quicker load times. I\\'ve been playing a lot of Fallout 76. On my PS4, it would routinely take upwards of 45 seconds to \"fast\" travel. I got in the habit of grabbing the phone and scrolling social media while it loaded. On the PS5, it\\'s more like 10 seconds, tops. Usually much less.\\n\\nI\\'ve also been playing the new(ish) God of War and load times are almost immediate. It\\'s uncanny.\\n\\nI\\'ve got an older TV (probably 2012) and even still, the graphics are a significant step forward.\\n\\nUltimately, it\\'s everything I loved about my PS4, except better. There\\'s not a single area where I feel like they took a step back except in storage...I had a 1 TB Black Ops 3 edition and would have liked the PS5 to beat that without resorting to aftermarket help.\\n\\nOtherwise, the controller feels better in my hands and has some cool bells and whistles (integrated mic, multi-function giant button, etc.), the load times are vastly improved with the SSD, and the games look better and run better.', '4': 'The PS5 box was fresh, still had the little tape seal at the top, the Call of duty MW3 Voucher was in there and does work. The only thing I didn’t like was the Amazon box they put the PS5 box in didn’t have a lot of cushion to protect it, but I mean the PS5 box already protects the PS5 pretty well.\\n\\nI also would recommend putting very specific instructions on how to find your address as they accidentally delivered it to my neighbors even if you live in a house and not an apartment just something to better identify your home.', '5': 'I could be wrong but I think the picture looks better than the old one. It’s a good buy if you don’t have one. The smaller one is OK. I had the older version and it’s noticeably smaller but not worth it if you own one. AS FOR COD MW3: Pay attention to your essential schedule. I’ve lost hours to his game because its just so good. It looks good and takes advantage of HDR. So many different available things to do but for sure activision is trying to figure out how to get their money out of you. A good bundle.', '6': 'The whole bundle came as advertised a brand new slim 2023 ps5 model with the removable disc drive, none of the marketing or descriptions disclosed that so i wasnt sure if this was the first model of ps5 or the new slim model that you can attach a disc derive to and it is indeed the new model with a modular drive. Copy of Spiderman 2 came with it as well as a download code, thats y only real \"comlaint\" i wish it was a game case with a disc but you cant complain for the price of the bundle you get a new revised slim version of the ps5 and a new game with it, i love the feel of the ps5 controller its way better than the ps4 controller. Biggest thing i\\'ve noticed is the console is absolutly silent to the point i have forgotten it was even on because my PC fans on low are louder than it. Overall a great console and a great bundle if you\\'ve been waiting to upgrade from ps4 as i have, this is the time you should take that chance to upgrade and now i can take full advantage of my 120hz 4K moniter so all in all this was a perfect bundle to buy as an early christmas present for yourself or someone else who\\'s wanted to upgrade to the next generation consoles.', '7': 'This System(PlayStation 5) Was Everything I Expected It To Be, The Design Of It 10/10!!!

Fortunately, her birthday is around Black Friday so Amazon had it on somewhat of a sale with Spider-Man. Few days later, it got delivered but we had a one week trip to Spain planned and she didn't get to open it. Sad face. The whole trip she kept talking about how excited she was to get back and setup the console to play. I literally married a child. Fast forward one week, we get back and the first thing she does is set up the ps5. According to her, the setup process was fairly easy. One thing we noticed is that the screen reader is default set to on. This was a bit annoying when you didn't expect it to be defaulted to on. A quick google search showed us how to disable it. Game play is super duper smooth but you need to make sure your HDMI cable is up to date as we originally used one from 2010 so the resolution was stuck at 1080. Graphics have come such a long way from my Xbox 360 days. Spider-Man's story line is fun to play along to and quite challenging.

Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.\", '2': 'I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I’d see if it was all I’d hoped it might be. Holy freakin’ crap!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that’s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I’ve instructed it.\\n\\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I’m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I’m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I’m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn’t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\\n\\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I’ll be using like crazy.\\n\\nTonight I’m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it’s even better that I imagined. Best little toy I’ve bought myself in years.\\n\\nI did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that’s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I’ve instructed it.\\n\\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I’m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal as I’m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I’m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn’t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that realistic. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\\n\\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I’ll be using like crazy.\\n\\nTonight I’m going to try watching a movie on it.

Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it’s even better that I imagined. Best little toy I’ve bought myself in years.', '3': \"I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\\n\\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\\n\\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\\n\\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\\n\\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\\n\\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\\n\\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.\", '4': \"I bought this to make sure I stayed active in my retirement years. Easy to use. Realistic beyond belief. If you wear glasses, make sure you put in the glasses spacer. You can do this by removing the black rubber around the perimeter of the mask. Start at the nose and pull up. Put in the spacer, then reattach the rubber. Makes a big difference. Favorite games are Beat Saber, 7th Guest, and the Jig saw puzzles. First time on 3D puzzles. Amazing.\\n\\nStop before you get tired, otherwise you might find yourself trying to lean against the realistic tables to rest a minute (7th Guest). You won't do it more than once! They're not really there! Have fun.\", '5': 'THIS IS FOR MY SON, HE HAD ONE AND IT BROKE... GOT HIM A NEW ONE... ONLY COMPLAINT WOULD BE THE VR IT SELF IS SMALLER AND SEEMS TO BE TIGHT AROUND THE HEAD PART.... WE COMPARED TEH OLD ONE AND NEW ONE AND IT IS INDEED A TAD SMALLER.... WE DID GET THE BATTERY ADD ON THIS TIME, AND THAT IS GREAT!!! WORKS WELL, AND BATTERY ADD ON IS GREAT.. KEEP IN MIND IF YOU HAVE HAD ONE BEFORE, AND BUY A NEW VR 2 IT IS THE SAME, BUT IS SMALLER...LITTLE TIGHT , NOT SURE WHY THEY WOULD MAKE IT SMALLER. BUT WORKS WELL!! MY SON IS VERY HAPPY!!!', '6': \"I bought this knowing the Quest 3 was out, but the price was the primary consideration for me at the time. I find this to be better or fit my needs better as I only wanted something for PCVR, and this fits the bill fine if you're seeking out for that experience without paying too much.\\n\\nWhat are some of the pros? One was that I found the overall setup experience to be seamless and relatively headache free. Second, the controllers and headset feel sturdy and well made, probably meant to withstand accidental scrapes and impacts with objects, cause that will happen regardless if you're careful with your play area. Third is the integration with Steam VR, and you can just play any games in your library from the get-go without any issues as long as you have a cable that supports the bandwidth required, or also charge while playing so you can have an extended session.\\n\\nThe only con that I have with this headset is the lack of IPD adjustability, which means I have to wear my prescription glasses and attach the spacers if I want to use the headset and not experience any blurriness. The Quest 3 has it built in as standard, but is also $200 over the MSRP of the Quest 2. It's not exactly the biggest drawback honestly, as it can vary from person to person.\", '7': \"At 26, and with a love for all things fun and techy, the Meta Quest 2 has been my latest craze. It's like unwrapping a present every time I put it on—with its vast world of games and immersive design experiences. Just a heads-up from someone who values comfort as much as a spontaneous dance-off: get the Elite Strap. It's the comfort upgrade that lets you play longer, design more, and dive deeper into VR without that 'need-a-break' feeling. Trust me, it's the smart move!\", '8': \"This was the best thing i've ordered in my life. I had tons of fun with it. The only things i dont like is the default headstrap. Its super uncomfortable. But you can always buy a new one, the... elite headstrap.\\n\\nAlso, the charger had an american outlet shape, so i couldnt stick it anywhere, but i came up with a solution and somehow fused it with one of unused cables that go with my outlet's shape and the charger works perfectly now.\", '9': \"Pros:\\n- Fairly Immersive.\\n- Amazing experiences.\\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.\\n\\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\\n\\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\\n\\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\\n\\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.\", '10': \"So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\\n\\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\\n\\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\\n\\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\\n\\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\\n\\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\\n\\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\\n\\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\\n\\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\\n\\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\\n\\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.\"}}}, {'_index': 'amazon_products_index', '_id': '4aggkYwB1daXz-oXODu-', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Reviews.8.keyword', 'Product Reviews.3.keyword', 'Product Reviews.9.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.4.keyword', 'Product Reviews.10.keyword', 'Product Reviews.2.keyword', 'Product Reviews.5.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'Xbox Series X 1TB SSD Console - Includes Wireless Controller - Up to 120 frames per second - 16GB RAM 1TB SSD - Experience True 4K Gaming Velocity Architecture', 'Product Price': None, 'Product Rating': '4.8', 'Product Number of Rates': '24,410 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ojzJk77qL._SX342_.jpg', 'Product Description': '    ', 'Product Reviews': {'1': 'Step into the realm of gaming greatness with the Xbox Series X, the Hercules of consoles – muscular, powerful, and ready to elevate your gaming experience to celestial heights!

It’s very user friendly and the graphics are wonderful. The package it came in was fun and very professional! Downloading disc games can take a while sometimes, but the system is fantastic! I absolutely adore the backwards compatibility!!! Absolute favorite feature for sure! This was the main selling point for me when I was looking into a new console to buy. I didn’t see the point in buying a PS5 if I couldn’t play the PS3 games that I currently have from my older system. At least with the Xbox series X I can still play the 360 games that I have and even buy more 360 games if I want! The memory is outstanding as well! Xbox also has a family settings app so I can keep up with the games my son is playing and how much time he logs on his system, as well as any messages from “friends.” Definitely worth the money in my opinion. Family friendly. User friendly. Just amazing. Keep up the good work Xbox!', '3': \"I bought this new console specifically for starfield. pretty sure my XOX was not going to run it. but I play a ton of Xbox games anyway so I didn't mind. it was well worth the cost. The NVMe SSD is phenomenally fast. I want to get another for the external expansion plug. I have a 500 GB SSD and a 5TB game drive plugged into the USB 3s. but the quick start is really awesome so I would like to have another stick for increased room there. some games need to be restarted every so often. Cyberpunk crashes if you use quick start too many times on it. it's an unstable game after running for 20 to 30 hours without a restart. That's fair. I'm not super picky about that because I get a lot of enjoyment out of the game.\\nwhat I don't understand, Microsoft, is why Seagate is the only supplier of the NVMe expansion cards, and why they are all out of stock!\\nand another thing, an NVMe for my PC is about $50. why are the expansions for this console $150? why don't you have one yourself, instead of only supplied by Seagate?\\nbut that complaint belongs on that other product, not the XSX. although this is a good place to bring it up as well.\\nthis console is noticeably faster than my XOX. you might say that's obvious but the OS / dashboard is remarkably faster. I had to run something on the XOX to transfer games over and was surprised at how sluggish it is. I had just gotten used to that and didn't know that it could be so much faster. and it is on the XSX! it is so much faster!\\nI was happy to see when this popped up in stock for the first time in years, literally. I grabbed it immediately because starfield was coming out and I was going to do my best to get it to run on the XOX but was skeptical. so, grabbing this was a no-brainer. I'm happy that I got it for $500 and that I waited for supplies to resume.\\nit's a surprisingly heavy black box! noticeably heavier than an Xbox One or XOS or XOX, and I owned all of them. what in the world is in that little box that makes it so heavy? it feels like there's a pound of gold inside. it must be a very heavy dense heat sink because I can't imagine silicone and plastic weighing so much. motherboards definitely don't weigh very much. The 4K Blu-ray doesn't wait that much. The power supply? yeah, probably, that might be integrated with the heat sink. not a complaint but just interesting.\", '4': 'My order arrived early, which was awesome. The device works as described, and there were no scratches or dings. My only concern was how it was boxed, they used an oversized box when packaged, but only placed one piece of paper inside, so when it was shipped the Xbox itself was moving around and getting jarred the entire time. It actually dented up the front of the packaging but fortunately everything still seems to work perfectly.', '5': 'This here Xbox Series X console, is the best of the best!!!! High speed power, 120 FPS, gaming power to the max!!!! Such a great purchase, I will purchase again in the near future for accessories!! Thank you Amazon for your amazing support on this product. I couldn’t thank you enough for the support.', '6': 'Xbox Series X is a huge improvement over the Xbox One I was previously using. I recommend upgrading if you are using an older Xbox model.', '7': \"Very simple to set up and transfer from an Xbox One and felt the difference between next-gen. It's very helpful in showing what your setup can and can't do. At $399.99, the Series X is worth it.\", '8': \"I have been a gammer all my life, have owned almost every console since the Atari Pong all the way till the Ps4 and Switch, but I have skipped most Xbox' s except for the original that was given to me as a gift.\\nThis new console that Microsoft has made is in my opinion the absolute best in this generation. Spec-wise it cannot be beat and if superior to the PS5 I most respects. But when you use your series X and in conjunction with Game Pass Ultimate (GPU), it simply becomes the hands down, no questions asked, absolute BEST VALUE in gaming anywhere! Today Microsoft has also teamed up their GPU service with EA, and now we can get most sports games and most EA titles included in GPU. But you must also add the future inclusion of Bethesda and all their amazing titles from day one in GUP since MS has bought them out.\\nSo how can't you go wrong with the MOST POWERFUL CONSOLE EVER MADE and the potential of including GPU to make it the best value in gaming PERIOD.\\n\\nYes some will think that their are few titles specifically made for this new generation as of this writing, but the same goes for Playstation, and Sony changed their mind in the short term, as most titles that they have as great exclusives are also being released for the foreseeable future on PS4 as well as PS5.\\n\\nPROS:\\n- Best Value in gaming when used with Game Pass Ultimate.\\n- Most powerful console ever made (12TFLOPS - 52 CU's).\\n- Intuitive and very functional OS.\\n- Great games even for this generation like: Medium.\\n- FPS Boos feature for older games.\\n- Automatic HDR for older games.\\n- Instant Resume feature is just awesome!\\n- Great controls, I thought I would not like them, BUT THEY ARE GREAT!\\n- Minimalistic design, that goes well with anything you have already.\\n- QUIET there is no noticeable sound of fans even when gaming for hours.\\n- More available space in internal drive then PS5.\\n\\nCONS:\\n- Controllers use a AA Battery... WHY would you do this in 2021? Yes there are options, but I should not need to look for options, personally for now I went the rechargeable Energizer route, but it is a hassle that should not be present in a console this generation.\\n- No gimmicks and straightforward pure power, no you don't get resistance in the adaptive triggers like a PS5, makes it feel a bit less futuristic.\\n- Had a bug happen to me more then once while purchasing new games, got an error, so for workaround had to add to cart, go to billing address, put edit, select the same billing address and then it worked, very annoying.\\n\\nSPECS:\\n- Processor: 8-core AMD Ryzen Zen 2-architecture CPU at 3.8GHz (3.6GHz with SMT)\\n- Graphics: AMD Navi/RDNA 2-family GPU with 52 CU at 1.825GHz (12TFLOPS FP32)\\n- Video:16GB GDDR6 with 14Gbps 320-bit interface (10GB at 560GB/s allocated to GPU, 6GB at 336GB/s allocated to rest of system with 3.5GB for GPU)\\n- Die Size: 360.45 mm2\\n- Process: 7nm Enhanced\\n- Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w/ 320mb bus\\n- Memory Bandwidth: 10 GB @ 560 GB/s, 6GB @ 336 GB/s\\n- Internal Storage: 1 TB Custom NVME SSD\\n- I/O Throughput: 2.4 GB/s (Raw), 4.8 GB/s (Compressed, with custom hardware decompression block)\\n- Expandable Storage: 1 TB Expansion Card - Seagate ATM only avail.\\n- External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD - WB Black Gaming 5TB what I got for it.\\n- Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive-\\n- Performance: 4K @ 60 FPS, up to 4K @ 120 FPS, 8K @ 60 FPS\\n- Size: 301mm x 151mm x 151mm\\n\\nFinally, I will recommend this console over the the PS5, its simply a BEAST and a better value when teamed with GPU. I won't get a Ps5 for the foreseeable future at least not till late 2022, since by then they might really have PS5 exclusives that don't get. a PS4 version.\\nThe Xbox Series X is such a great console that you would be hard pressed to look it over over the hype that the Ps5 has generated because of its lack of availability. So if you like simply the best console this generation and wish to get the best bang for your buck, Xbox Series X simply rocks.\\n\\nPRO+ : The Xbox series X is also an amazing emulation system, it can run Retroarch with no hacks, with nothing weird, just look it up in YouTube and you will find tutorials. But it can do emulation like very few systems and it add to its tremendous lineup and value.\\n\\nGreat job Microsoft, you not only added a customer, but a new fan.\", '9': 'Our old Xbox One was dying a few months back, so we bit the bullet and upgraded to this. We both play, so we also got an extra controller (the console comes with one). I took the extra one, and my husband took the one that came with the console. In case you\\'re curious, my old controller\\'s buttons were starting to give out as well right around the time the console was dying, and my husband wanted a backup controller, hence the need for two new controllers instead of just one. Anyway...I was using the \"extra\" one because it\\'s purple (yay!). It works fabulously. The console itself is amazing because all the games we have played load ridiculously fast, and the graphics are amazing. Then the not great part: my husband\\'s old controller (which we *just* bought last Christmas) died one week after getting the new console up and running. No biggie, we have the new controller to use, right? So he grabbed the one that came with the console and started using it. That was just a few months ago. The stick drift started a few weeks ago, and it got really bad really fast. That controller is straight up unusable now. Thank god for the black friday sales coming up this month. Given how new the console and controller are, I thought someone would help us, but no. Neither Amazon nor Microsoft/Xbox care one bit. I guess less than 6 months is now the expected lifespan of a new controller? At least the console is nice.', '10': 'So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box? Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.\\n\\nYou open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it\\'s in a treasure chest. It was great! I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console. So good job on that!\\n\\nI\\'m upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade. I\\'ve got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it! I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.\\n\\nAnd here it is.\\n\\nVisually speaking, I\\'m not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S. There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren\\'t there before. Everything is less fuzzy. So that\\'s good. It\\'s just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES. Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2. But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One. The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me. I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I\\'m playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.\\n\\nAnd that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games. While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn\\'t anything on the Xbox that can\\'t be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility). With Halo Infinite being delayed, there\\'s no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.\\n\\nWell... I SAY that but I also don\\'t regret doing so. I\\'m disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice. And it isn\\'t even the best part of the Series X. That would be the load times. With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast. I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done. This thing zips along. That also applies while you\\'re in the game. Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly. There\\'s a lot of power in this rectangular box. The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it\\'s not a selling feature if you\\'re comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.\\n\\nIt\\'s a lot of the \"under-the-hood\" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One. The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox\\'s back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you\\'ll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren\\'t brand new exclusives. I\\'ve got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now. If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service. I spent my first day just downloading everything I\\'m going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.\\n\\nAnd, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass. You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X. It\\'s a good deal.\\n\\nI\\'m happy with my purchase. I wish Halo would have made launch. I\\'m also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it\\'s worth playing. But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable. In the end, it comes down to where your friends are. Mine are on Xbox so here I am. This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I\\'m going to regret having it a year or so down the line.\\n\\nBut if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don\\'t really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season. Miles Morales looks really good.\\n\\nBut if Sony\\'s exclusives don\\'t move you, the third party games are all multiplatform. You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin\\'s Creeds on whatever console you manage to get. In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there\\'s enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.\\n\\nOh! This thing also has a controller! It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller. This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version. There\\'s a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch. So Microsoft is a little behind but it\\'s here now! I have not used it yet but I\\'m sure I\\'ll get around to it.\\n\\nAnyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware. This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time. Day one, you know what you\\'re getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.\\n\\nBut, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)'}}}, {'_index': 'amazon_products_index', '_id': '4qggkYwB1daXz-oXODvx', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Reviews.8.keyword', 'Product Description.keyword', 'Product Reviews.3.keyword', 'Product Reviews.9.keyword', 'Product Reviews.7.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.4.keyword', 'Product Reviews.6.keyword', 'Product Reviews.10.keyword', 'Product Reviews.2.keyword', 'Product Reviews.5.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'Meta Quest 3 128GB— Breakthrough Mixed Reality — Powerful Performance — Asgard’s Wrath 2 Bundle', 'Product Price': '499', 'Product Rating': '4.4', 'Product Number of Rates': '1,959 ratings', 'Product Image Address': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81whTB488bL._SX342_.jpg', 'Product Description': ' Get the epic new Asgard’s Wrath 2 included (a $59.99 value)* when you buy Meta Quest 3 128GB*.

', 'Product Reviews': {'1': 'Update: Five Weeks Later\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn\\'t worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn\\'t feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else.\\n\\nI originally didn\\'t care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they had made a lighter headset without the upgraded passthrough, but now passthrough is everything to me. It let\\'s me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Eleven Table Tennis, and Meta Quest Browser for AR female hologram eye candy. One of the first AR games that I tried is a free game called First Encounters. It\\'s a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It\\'s so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I might have bought that, but I didn\\'t think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don\\'t think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It\\'s super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that\\'s a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I am sure that I will keep installed and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn\\'t think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don\\'t need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the default Quest 3 wall charger and link cable. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging the cord or the Quest 3 cable. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don\\'t feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\\n\\nI just can\\'t get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don\\'t know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn\\'t appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don\\'t buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App lets you stream your PCVR games to your Quest headset, wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don\\'t think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It\\'s better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don\\'t need the best WIFI routers. Virtual Desktop lets you have a virtual desktop in passthrough mode, but Immersed lets you too and in Immersed you can have up to four computer screens and you get to be around other users and their avatars. I still use Virtual Desktop for the head lock feature, which keeps the desktop screen in front of your face no matter what direction are are facing or where you move or walk to. I use it to read manhua while walking around the house for exercise. I am hoping that the headlock feature will be added to Immersed soon.\\n\\nResident Evil 4. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it\\'s because it is VR or something but it truly is fun walking around in a realistic setting. I like the scenery better than Arizona Sunshine or The Walking Dead. The first Red Matter game was great, but sadly it was short and doesn\\'t really have any replay value once you\\'ve completed the story. Green Hell looks really interesting. It\\'s a realistic survival game. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game that is sorta interesting if co-op RPG games are your thing. It is a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. Genotype is a bit interesting. but the texture detail isn\\'t as high as I would like.\\n\\nFor fitness, I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nI also suggest getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR). On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and mirror you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven\\'t really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor in PCVR games. It has other features like key binding, but I don\\'t care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don\\'t like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you\\'d have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can\\'t let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It\\'s not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven\\'t had any problems.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don\\'t use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won\\'t work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 65% five star ratings. If you can\\'t appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people to try the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don\\'t get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn\\'t a Porsche. Entitled much?', '2': 'So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We\\'ve come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \"pancake\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you\\'re playing games or experiences, you won\\'t even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don\\'t think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I\\'ve never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I\\'m super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn\\'t put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There\\'s a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who\\'s been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you\\'ll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You\\'re still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that\\'s too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there\\'s already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you\\'re not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You\\'re still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there\\'s a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won\\'t even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It\\'s amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that\\'s still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I\\'ve seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \"who wants this? I don\\'t need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it\\'s, \"oh wow, I never thought I\\'d get into this, now I want more!\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here\\'s where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It\\'s one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn\\'t bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It\\'s not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn\\'t protrude as much, due to its new design, but it\\'s no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it\\'s a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it\\'s even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I\\'m playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.', '3': \"There is no doubt this thing is superior to the Quest 2 in almost every way possible. Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.\\n\\nPros -\\nDisplay - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.\\n\\nAudio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvement\\n\\nAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nDisplay\\n\\nWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.\\n\\n1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.\\n\\n2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.\\n\\n3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.\\n\\n4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.\\n\\nComfort\\n\\nThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.\\n\\nEcosystem\\n\\nThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headset\\n\\nPassthrough\\n\\nThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.\", '4': \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR¹, thus far the native apps aren’t of interest] and didn’t use it as much as I’d expected.² With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I’ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n😺 Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n😻 Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2’s Fresnel lenses and the Q3’s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the “sweet-spot” is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n😺 Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I’m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n😿 Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n😻 Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. 😬😬😬😬\\n\\n😻 IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n😐 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2’s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3’s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I’ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I’ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n• battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n• sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n• eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n• native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I’m sad there weren’t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it’s a still terrific bargain. It’s a shame about the contrast though 😹\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn’t have wifi enabled and couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n¹ — For PCVR I’m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta’s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I’ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I’ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop’s “HVEC 10-bit” encoder, which graphically is better than the plain “HVEC” encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n² — Considering the price I paid vis-à-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\", '5': 'I\\'ve been in the VR game for a while now, going all the way back to the Oculus Rift dev kit 2 days. My other current headset is a Valve Index, and I mainly bought the Quest 3 with the intention of playing the Quest-exclusive games, fully expecting it to feel like a toy in comparison.\\n\\nIn practice, I\\'m in love with this thing. The displays are both high resolution and high quality, with little to no screendoor effect, and the tracking is impressively stable for something only being tracked by cameras and software. I thought the removal of the rings from the Q2 controllers would cause them to have more issues with occlusion, but I haven\\'t noticed anything. Even the features I didn\\'t know it had are pretty cool for the games that support them, like its mixed reality and controller-free hand tracking. But the thing that\\'s really going to keep me away from my Index (at least for the games that aren\\'t specifically tailored to it, like Half Life Alyx) is that I had no idea how much I needed to ditch the cable and play wirelessly until now. Being able to just walk around in my room without having to be aware of the cable behind me is such a nice feeling that it feels like I\\'m getting into VR for the first time again.\\n\\nWith that said, there are some small caveats -- namely, that this is not really a $500 headset. Meta has taken on a sort of Spirit Airlines approach, where the headset itself is affordably priced in exchange for other basic things being extremely expensive \"accessories\". The strap is the main offender, with the default one being the rough equivalent of just tying the headset to your head. They\\'re happy to sell you a $60 strap, or a $130 one that extends the battery, though! And while you\\'re at it you can blow $80 on a cable for linking it to your pc if you aren\\'t a fan of wireless tethering, a $70 carrying case, a $40 silicone facial interface for extra comfort, a $130 charging dock to replace the controllers needing AA batteries, $40 hand straps for the controllers to give them Index-esque free-hand support... To be clear, most, if not all of these have off-brand counterparts that are just as good (or better!) for a fraction of the price, but my point is this is not a fully out of the box experience for those with more discerning tastes. For parents buying them for their younger children they\\'ll probably be thrilled with it anyways, and can safely ignore all of that, but I would wager most adults will probably end up wanting at least a new head strap of some kind, whether it\\'s the official one or not.\\n\\nIgnoring the troublesome accessories, though, this is an easy win as far as I\\'m concerned. The only real competition is that the Quest 2 is still holding its own as well from what I hear, and for prices that seem to be as low as they could possibly be around the holiday season. I can\\'t speak first-hand on whether the Q3 is worth a $300 difference, but I can say I don\\'t regret buying it. I held off on the Quest line of headsets because I\\'ve never been a big fan of Meta as a company, but I have to begrudgingly admit that this is probably the best vr headset at the best price you could get right now.', '6': \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\", '7': \"The product arrived today, i recorded the opening and bootup.\\nNo dead pixels, passthrough works, there was a small issue with the nose piece not set but after looking it up it seems to be a common issue because of the way the VR opens/closes to adjust to face sizes.\\n\\nIf this occurs, gently push along the nose ridge and it will readjust itself as long as no lock-tab parts are actually damaged. I lucked out, as none of the tabs were broken and were able to go back into place.\\n\\nThe amazon box it came in again didn't have any protection what so ever. But the product itself was fine/stable in it's package box with appropriate padding.\\n\\nI had no issues getting it registered to meta, and grabbed a couple of free games that downloaded quickly enough. I haven't tried them, but I did explore the passthrough and nonpassthrough feature.\\n\\nVisual wise it's actually quite a bit more clear/crisp compared to the ps4 Vr(which is what I can compare it to). As it has a higher resolution/pixel count. I still haven't taken off the default stickers that protect the lenses until I can put on lense protectors. But even through all of the writing on the label that tells you NOT to use any form of liquid cleaners, even lense. It's visual is damn good.\\n\\nThe passthrough visual via camera is on par with a ps4 VR headset: and suffer's some glitches when it hits reflective surfaces but that is normal as camera's hate that extra reflection of light.. But interface/scenes are definitely more clear and crisp. Sound quality is good, not like being at a rock concert, but goes loud enough to enjoy. Headsets for sound actually aren't really needed for this VR.\\n\\nI haven't hooked it up to a computer yet, as it's suppose to be the 'big' gift for me and my fiancé to enjoy over Christmas. As it was a purchase done by the both of us - after calculating expenses..\\n\\nSo the big question: Is it worth the money?\\n\\nMy answer: Yes, I recommend going for the larger size because most of the games you will be downloading are often between 5-40gb.. With a few exceptions that could easily hit 80gb - example skyrim(haven't checked the store to see if that one is available on meta). Plus any mods one might want to add to the games.\\n\\nI was glad to see they had some of my more unique playstation favorites in their store. This made me happy, despite needing to buy it again. (Btw The Wizards* is excellent and lets you feel like your literally casting spells, or using a bow.)\\n\\nWith that said, go for the BIGGER hard drive: it will make it so your VR can hold more then 3 games without suffering quality issues. As you always want to leave room(1-5gb) for the OS(opperating system) to run smoothly. Then you won't have to worry about uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing cache/HD maintence every time you want to change your lineup.\\n\\n**For people with limited understanding of storage space 512GB should easily allow you to store 15-25games which if you have 'data' usage limits for whatever reason would avoid burn up of data by constantly downloading the same thing.\", '8': 'I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I\\'m never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I\\'ve had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I\\'m 55 lol and I\\'m an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can\\'t believe how far I\\'ve come playing it! I\\'ve played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I\\'m talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don\\'t play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I\\'ve played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I\\'ve gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it\\'s because it\\'s a more powerful headset. I still don\\'t see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it\\'s doesn\\'t heat up .. yet.. we\\'ll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don\\'t judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I\\'m still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn\\'t get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I\\'m also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven\\'t tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It\\'s more like trying to see under water. At least it\\'s in color now. I\\'m not a big fan of mixed reality. I\\'m in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don\\'t want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they\\'d disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I\\'m doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \"rug burn\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It\\'s a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it\\'s not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI\\'m praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat\\'s it so far. I\\'ll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It\\'s not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don\\'t listen to all of the negative Nellie\\'s out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It\\'s all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he\\'d been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn\\'t have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone♡', '9': \"Buy the Quest 3, DO NOT BUY THE QUEST 2. I still use my Quest 2 it's great but I don't care how cheap it is, the Quest 3 is that much better in both performance and visuals. Even games not updated still look and play smoother. The Quest 3 is good enough to get into VR gaming without a PC. The Quest 1 felt like a gimmick , the Quest 2 was good but still felt compromised but the Quest 3 (while obviously not as a good the average PCVR gaming pc) is able to get much closer and provide a PCVR like experience on newer games. Mixed reality was not something I was interested in but after trying it I think it's awesome, even if you consider it a gimmick it's very cool and fun tech. As someone who really only cared about PC based VR gaming I've been very impressed with the Quest 3. After going on a VR binge in 2019 and some of 2020 I've mostly only played VRChat now but because of the Quest 3 I started exploring VR games again trying out new and old games and even mixed reality stuff too. It's that good but I'd recommend an aftermarket headstrap. The included headstrap seems pretty bad but if you fiddle with it A LOT it can get comfy. Also I returned my 128GB model and bought the 512GB one. It should not cost that much more in price but honestly there's so much cool stuff and games are slowly getting bigger. If you have fast internet , you can buy the 128GB and be fine.\\n\\nThere's tons of amateur and professional unboxing videos of the Quest 3 that you can look at if you want to see what it looks like. As for what it's like to buy and own it? It's amazing.\\nBackground info: I've been a computer based VR player since 2017 when I got the original Oculus Rift also known as the CV1 on a Black Friday sale. Since then I've bought an Index in 2020 with vive trackers for full body tracking, a Quest 1 as a backup headset, a Quest 2 and now a Quest 3. I have about 6000 hours in VR 5000 of that is in VRChat.\\nReview: The Quest 3 is incredible. It's my first VR headset that uses pancake lens and it's beautiful. I dabbled in standalone gaming on my Quest 2 with games like Resident Evil 4 VR and Iron Man VR which were both great. Iron Man felt a little held back resolution wise with aggressive foveated rendering BUT THE Quest 3 fixes that mostly with higher resolution in literally everything. Everything from the interface to all old and new games feel snappy. I started playing mixed reality mini games like the Ghost Busters one and Synth Riders and the free built in Alien one and everything has been super cool. it's all surprisingly fun. Audio is also great, about as good as the Index. The whole thing feels more reliable though as my Index cable is annoying with how heavy and thick it is. I'm on my third cable in 3 years and still the Index needs to be unplugged sometimes to make it work. I've had no such problems on my Quest 2 and Quest 3. The only reason I still use my Index is for easy full body tracking in VRChat otherwise I play everything on my Quest 3.\", '10': \"As an enthusiast of cutting-edge technology and immersive experiences, the Meta Quest 3 128GB has completely redefined my perception of mixed reality.

The games often feature memorable characters and plot twists.\\n\\nInnovation: The Super Mario series has been at the forefront of innovation in the gaming industry.

Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer, there's likely a Super Mario game that will provide hours of entertainment and joy.\", '2': 'Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family\\'s favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nFrom the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey\\'s Cappy or Mario Sunshine\\'s FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don\\'t need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren\\'t quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.\\n\\nGraphics:\\nGraphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.\\n\\nControls:\\nThe controls, for the most part, are what you\\'d expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn\\'t notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.\\n\\nCo-op:\\nThe co-op mode is where \"Super Mario Wonder\" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don\\'t receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.\\n\\nOverall Assessment:\\nSuper Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I\\'ll update as we continue our adventure...', '3': 'Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.\\n\\nMy first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn’t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.\\n\\nWhen Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I’d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn’t been playing any games as of late.\\n\\nAll that to say, this game is simply wonderful. “Wonder” was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.\\n\\nThe gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can’t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.\\n\\nI’m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can’t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario’s, but I’m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It’s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.\\n\\n10/10', '4': \"Introduction:\\nAs a self-proclaimed cool dad with a lifelong love for video games, I was excited to dive into the Mario Wonder Switch Game. Mario has been a part of my gaming journey since I was a kid, and I couldn't wait to see what this new title had to offer. In this in-depth review, I'll share my insights and experiences playing the game from a cool dad's perspective.\\n\\nGameplay and Mechanics:\\nThe gameplay of Mario Wonder Switch is nothing short of magical. It captures the classic Mario charm while introducing innovative mechanics. The variety of power-ups, from the Super Mushroom to the new Wonder Suit, adds a layer of fun and excitement. The controls are responsive and intuitive, making it easy for both veteran gamers and newcomers to enjoy. The level design is masterful, offering a balanced blend of nostalgic elements and fresh challenges that keep me and my kids engaged for hours.\\n\\nGraphics and Art Style:\\nThe visuals in Mario Wonder Switch are a visual treat. The vibrant, colorful world of the Mushroom Kingdom is brought to life with stunning detail and animations. The game's art style combines the best of modern graphics technology with the timeless charm of Mario, resulting in a delightful visual experience that leaves a smile on my face and my kids' faces.\\n\\nStory and Adventure:\\nMario games have never been renowned for their intricate stories, but Mario Wonder Switch delivers a fun and engaging narrative. The story, while simple, adds a layer of motivation to the game. The adventure takes you through various captivating worlds, each brimming with unique challenges and quirky characters. The game keeps the excitement alive by introducing twists and turns that you won't see coming.\\n\\nMultiplayer Fun:\\nOne of the highlights for a cool dad is the multiplayer experience, and Mario Wonder Switch doesn't disappoint. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows my kids and me to team up and enjoy the game together. It's a fantastic way to bond with them while solving puzzles, battling foes, and working as a team. The competitive mode is also a blast for some healthy family rivalry.\\n\\nNostalgia Factor:\\nBeing a lifelong Mario fan, I appreciate the nods to the franchise's history. Mario Wonder Switch includes various references and throwbacks to earlier titles, making it a nostalgia trip for me. It's a pleasure to share these moments with my kids and tell them about the good old days of gaming.\\n\\nReplay Value:\\nThe game's extensive content and collectibles add significant replay value. Exploring every nook and cranny, hunting for Power Moons, and trying to achieve 100% completion is a journey that keeps the fun going long after the main story is completed. It's a game that we keep coming back to, providing lasting value and entertainment.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nMario Wonder Switch is a marvelous addition to the Mario franchise, and it has certainly lived up to the hype. As a cool dad, it's been an absolute joy to share this gaming experience with my kids. The gameplay, graphics, story, and multiplayer options make it an all-around fantastic game that bridges the generation gap. Mario continues to be the ultimate family-friendly game, and Mario Wonder Switch is no exception. It's a game that cements Mario's status as a beloved icon for all ages.\", '5': \"OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.\", '6': 'So I have to say that I was almost disappointed months ago to learn that Nintendo was making another 2D Mario game. The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I’ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn’t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I’m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn’t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn’t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I’m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it’s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I’d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!! Get this game. You won’t be disappointed. 10/10', '7': 'Knowing Nintendo and what they do, I want to make sure I acquire an actual physical copy of their first party titles. This is a great game. No more \"new\" deviations to the Mario 2D platform games. It has a fresh look and gameplay. There is plenty to do in the game and great for picking it up and playing every now and then without having to understand some complicated storyline or starting the entire game over.\\n\\nI have just one gripe. There is a slight bit of disappointment when I rip off the plastic wrapping and opening the game case in anticipation. There is no manual, no map, no poster, no swag. There are clips for it but nothing there. I open it and there\\'s just a tiny game card/cartridge at the bottom. It just feels empty. At least put some kind of advertisement for your other games in it, Nintendo. It\\'s a missed opportunity.', '8': \"The graphics are a visual treat. The vibrant colors and detailed landscapes make every level a work of art. It's like playing in a living, breathing cartoon world, and it's utterly captivating.\\n\\nThe gameplay is where the real magic happens. Whether you're jumping on Goombas, collecting coins, or discovering hidden power-ups, it's an exhilarating experience that takes me back to the nostalgia of my childhood. And the controls on the Nintendo Switch are so intuitive; it's gaming bliss.\\n\\nOne of my favorite scenarios is playing this game with friends. It's pure multiplayer fun! Competing in challenges, cooperating on tough levels, or simply exploring together - it's a blast every time.\\n\\nThe replay value is outstanding. With so many levels and secrets to uncover, I find myself coming back for more, each time with a sense of wonder and anticipation.\", '9': \"This is so fun!!! Last year I got this deep, insane itch to play Super Mario Bros. on 3DS, which is what I grew up playing. However, after digging through my games, I couldn't find it. My local game store has the game marked up so high that I decided I would rather cry and keep my money. So when Nintendo came out with this game this year, I jumped for joy. It has so many cool features, including having different gaming experiences with each character you play as, which results in essentially an infinite number of different playing experiences. So cool. Buy. It.\", '10': 'My sister and I have been playing Mario Bros on various platforms (Wii, wiiU, switch) since we were very young. We have completed all of them and are always looking for new challenges that are multiplayer. While most of the levels were easier than the average super Mario bros levels, there were quite a few levels that would definitely make our list of most challenging levels (the top level being 9-2 of super Mario bros deluxe). The concepts were new but easy to understand and reminded us of the joy these games brought us growing up. Whether you are debating on getting this for your kids or getting it to play as an adult, I would definitely add this to your collection regardless of your skill background.'}}}, {'_index': 'amazon_products_index', '_id': '5aggkYwB1daXz-oXOTt_', '_score': 1.0, '_ignored': ['Product Reviews.3.keyword', 'Product Reviews.9.keyword', 'Product Reviews.1.keyword', 'Product Reviews.4.keyword', 'Product Reviews.6.keyword', 'Product Reviews.10.keyword', 'Product Reviews.2.keyword', 'Product Reviews.5.keyword'], '_source': {'Product Name': 'Nintendo Switch™ - OLED Model: Super Smash Bros.™ Ultimate Bundle (Full Game Download + 3 Mo.

I can think of at least 30 bosses in Super Mario RPG, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch.\\n\\nIt's not a perfect game, but for a game that came out 30 years ago, and has only been minimally upgraded in this remake, it is SHOCKINGLY close.\\n\\nOf all the Mario games that exist, this one is One of the must-have games in the series, alongside: Super Mario World, Super Mario Bros 3, Super Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with all the DLC, Super Mario Bros Wonder,.....and the remake of Super Mario 64 that they absolutely desperately need to make.....\\n\\nThis is better than the original Mario Bros, the original Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros The Lost levels, Super Mario Bros 2, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2, all the Paper Mario games, all the Super Mario Land games, all the Mario Party games, almost all of the Mario Kart games, all the Mario sports games, etc etc etc.\\n\\nThis belongs in that core handful of Mario games that every gamer needs to play to understand how phenomenal Mario can truly be.\\n\\nIt's a tiny thumbnail-sized game cartridge full of happiness.\\n\\n🤷🏻\\u200d♂️\", '2': \"This was my first RPG I remember playing back in 1996. It launched my love of turn based role playing games. I think I beat this game a few dozen times on the Super Nintendo when I was 12. I have very fond memories of this game. So when I heard it was being released on the switch I was very excited.\\n\\nI broke one of my cardinal rules of game buying with this. I pre-ordered it. Nintendo rarely has launch issues with games but I still try to avoid pre-ordering games. But I couldn't help myself with this one.\\n\\nThe game is excellent. They upgraded the graphics which may have taken away some of the charm of the original but I think it looks great. They even kept in the 2d OG mario Easter Egg in Boosters Tower, and pixelated Culex boss. The game play was exactly as I remembered it and still a joy to play.\\n\\nNintendo made a few quality of life improvements to the game. First they created a Breezy mode which makes the game just a bit easier. It lifts the item cap, makes the timed attack window larger and more forgiving, and makes the enemies easier (I have my 6 year old playing on this setting).\\n\\nOther QOL improvements include adding an icon to help with timed attacks. A chest in Mario's house to carry extra items where in the original they would just be lost. The game now auto saves pretty frequently (usually as you enter a new area), so you don't have to search out a save location. They also added a upgrade to the signal ring that makes it easier to find hidden treasures, that can be acquired later in the game. They also added post game play, making the bosses more challenging and adding new weapons and gear.\\n\\nMost of the online reviews to this game forget it's an introductory RPG meant for children. They nitpick and complain about the lack of challenge. Super Mario RPG is a fantastic game that will take around 13 hours to beat, but it's a great 13 hours. If you played this game in the 90s get it. If you have a child and are looking to get them a forgiving turn based RPG to learn, get this game. If you are looking for 13 hours of fun without the grind of games like Final Fantasy, get this game. If you want a challenging grueling slog that will take hours off your life and leave you angry most of the time, get Dark Souls.\", '3': 'If you are expecting a typical side scroll 2D jump, jump, jump Mario game, you will be disappointed (watch the trailers).\\n\\nBasic Plot: Mario and his team must join together and save all the people in the mushroom kingdom from the evil Smithy, a monster who destroyed the star road so that people’s wishes will never come true (simplified version).\\n\\nGeneral review: The game stays true to the original SNES title with minor changes and quality of life improvements. The game looks fantastic and plays true to the original. The plot and story are much more complex compared to typical Mario saves Peach games. The characters are extremely unique and bring a whole lot of personality to the Mario world and characters we love. It is not an open world game, but there are still quite a few areas to explore with secrets and treasures to find.\\n\\nGameplay: The fight sequences use a turn based style where the three people in your party take turns to attack before your enemy (s) will have their turn to counter attack (simple explanation of it). The turn based style can be repetitive and boring if you are not accustomed to this gameplay or looking for something more fast paced.\\n\\nGameplay: This is an RPG so you do gain experience points as you slay enemies and level up your party members. When you level, you will have 3 options to pick from: physical attack/defense, magical attack/defense, or health/hp. Whichever you pick, the stats within that category will increase. For an RPG, it is a very simple leveling system and easy to understand without getting overly complex.\\n\\nMy experience: Personally, I played/beat the original SNES countless times and was able to beat this remastered version to 100% within 12 hours… but again, experience was on my side. I would say for someone new to this, it could take them 10 - 20 hours - a shorter and easier RPG with a captivating plot.\\n\\nFinal thoughts: It is an easy RPG for experienced players but you play for the story (or nostalgia), not the difficulty. If you are looking for a good, easy introduction to RPGs, this is a good game to start with for not being overly complicated. If you do not like turn based attacks, RPGs, or just looking for a typical fast paced challenging Mario game, this is not the game for you.\\n\\n5 stars for a 1-1 remaster of the original (with additional, new gameplay content) and what I expected the game would be.', '4': \"The developers of this game knew exactly what it would take to please the fans of this game. Simply put, this game is the best remake that I have played in the past couple of years. It has so much love poured into it, every detail that I expected to be here from the original game is here- and additional content. I was incredibly scared that the hype for this game was going to end up causing it to be a bad game, but that is not the case.\\n\\nThis is a fantastic game that caters to both fans of the original game and those who are wanting to get into RPGs. I have seen several 1 star reviews, and to be completely honest those reviews seemed to have come from those who have never played an RPG before and expected simply another Mario game coming into this. I can't think of anything that this game doesn't improve upon from the original game. The RPG mechanics are engaging, even difficult at times with having the player time certain actions within battles to drastically change the gameplay. However, it does a fantastic job with the ! indicators telling the player when to properly time their button presses.\\n\\nThe story is of course a remake of the original title on the SNES, however I believe that its humor still stands today. I can't really say many games today make me laugh the way they intended or at least without a slight awkward feeling at a forced joke, but this game actually makes me smile more often than not. This game has some seriously funny moments, and the modernized visuals make scenes much more entertaining.\\n\\nThe only negative element I can even come up with for this game is the slight frame drops when the scene gets too intense with effects and too many models. Aside from that, the game runs at seemingly a solid 60 fps, with 30 fps for the cutscenes. Aside from the random moments of lag, the game is beautiful and runs fantastic.\\n\\nI without a doubt recommend this game.\", '5': 'This is nearly a 1 to 1 remake of the original Super Mario RPG game. The music remaster is beautiful and you can even opt for the original soundtrack in the settings. But the remaster of the music is so good you may not want to. All the little things you may remember (if you played the original) are still there. The hidden block you only have one or two opportunities to grab in the Mushroom Kingdom... Link and Samus snoozing at the inn.\\n\\nWhat they did is they recreated the entire game with updated HD graphics. But kept Mario\\'s pudgy little design the same. The \"cutscenes\" have been replaced with full rendered cutscenes that pan down to in game engine graphics instead of just watching in game graphics move about to act out a scene.\\n\\nThe best change though is the post game content. Rematches with all the bosses (story element explains why) and they are much tougher the second time around. New \"ultimate\" weapons post game and even some new super bosses to use those shiny new weapons on.\\n\\nThey pretty much kept the original experience until you beat the game. After that, they gave you more to chew on as additions. A bestiary. A music player. In game stats. Super bosses, rematches, new gear.\\n\\nThis is how you do a remaster. A proper remaster.\\n\\nI truly hope they use all this effort to give this game a long overdue sequel. Because it is one of the best Mario games out there. Paper Mario and the Mario + Luigi games can\\'t hold a candle to this.', '6': 'Super Mario RPG is nearly a 1:1 remake of the original Super Nintendo game in just about every way you could think of. The original OST is included as an option as well. Some subtle changes were made to combat to make it a bit easier for newcomers and just enough changes for veterans to keep them on their toes. The Unity Engine provides excellent graphics and lighting, with vibrant colors and just pop off the screen. If you have an OLED Switch or and OLED TV, you will really be able to see how good it looks. The charm and silliness of the original game are 100% intact and it is sure to become part of the discussion of great remakes/remasters for years to come.\\n\\nFor anyone looking to take a trip down memory lane or even for the newcomer, this game is a masterpiece that everyone should be able to enjoy. Grab a physical copy of this game before it disappears and becomes impossible to find.', '7': \"There will, no doubt, be those who disagree with this sentiment, but as someone who dearly loves the original game, and has played through it several times over the course of my life, THIS is what every remake of any game should aspire to. It keeps faithful to the original game, while improving on it in many ways. Some fights feel easier, while others feel harder. Parts of the game I would have sworn were longer are now shorter. There are cutscenes that add more to basically all of the characters, the updated graphics keep all the charm of the game's style while looking great, and the ending cinematic made me smile like a little kid. One of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time, brought by a brilliant remake of an already excellent game. I'd give it more than five stars if I could. Seven would seem an appropriate number.\", '8': \"Super Mario RPG is an SNES classic that most RPG fans love. The game is essentially the same as it was back in the day, but with some added combat elements that make the game even easier than it already is. Visually looks great but the frame rate drop on this is unacceptable in my eyes. It was the same for Zelda Links Awakening, and I just don't get why they can't have a buttery smooth 30-60fps when we get that in other games like Mario Kart. Still, this is Nintendo history reborn, and should be played by every RPG and Mario fan.\", '9': \"The problem with remaking video games is the design philosophy around what a remake should even try to accomplish. Video games just don't age as well as products from most other mediums. True, I love video games and they are my favorite way to pass time, but game mechanics, graphics and interactivity can resonate with older audiences that hadn't encountered them before while newer ones will often at best find them quaint and others find them cumbersome. Should a remake essentially tart up the aesthetics and keep the core gameplay the same, winning over the original audience but potentially losing the new? Or should a remake shake things up, evolving what was rusty from the ground up, risking the loss of what made the game special to begin with?\\n\\nSuper Mario RPG is unabashedly in the first camp. It is very safe. It introduces some minor mechanics like the triple attacks that don't factor much in moment to moment gameplay at all, and adds some boss rematches and such. It sticks close to the original, remaking the graphics and music but not really shaking up the script, the general story, the turn based gameplay or the bad platforming (for a Mario game, even an RPG, that's honestly a serious flaw for a game with a lot of it).\\n\\nSpeaking as someone who has always had a fascination with Super Mario RPG, but never played through it entirely, this remake gave me my fill. I still prefer its successors; the first two Paper Marios are simply tighter, more engaging experiences. Regardless, this game is funny, quite charming, and has lots of cute metagame moments, like a boss that literally disables your attack options (novel for 1996). I do think it loses a bit in the jump to 3D; the original 2D, chunky graphics were beautiful and strange and compelling and gave rise to many memes because of it. The remake looks good but in a bland way, not blocky and puffy like the old sprites but losing a bit of their memorability. The music is of course fantastic. Yoko rarely misses.\\n\\nIt's a strangely unbalanced experience, in terms of pacing. Some stars are found much quicker than others, and a decent amount of the story feels like padding, albeit amusing padding. The final area(s) feel rushed and the finicky imprecise jumping controls I feel really falter here.\\n\\nIf it sounds like my review is a little harsher than kind, it's because I hadn't grown up with this game and I'm approaching it as an N64 kid playing it for the first time being almost in my thirties. People who played and loved the original will have plenty of fun seeing what was changed, reliving iconic moments and so on. In all honesty it's a good game, and still worth playing. All Mario RPGs, and even many RPGs in general now, borrow a lot from this game and that has to be acknowledged. It's influential for a reason; the people at Square clearly loved making this game, and that rubs off on the player. I just wish that reverence could factor into bolder gestures toward making the game fresher over 25 years later, and by not charging full price for what is nearly the same amount of game content from '96.\\n\\nRecommended if you like Mario, easy SNES RPGs, and big Yoshis, and especially if you like all three.\", '10': 'Not a good $ for hour ratio but that’s a toxic way to measure the joy you get from playing a game. Extremely true to the original, this remake is nothing but improvements. The only downside - it’s even easier now! And they didn’t add a hard mode, only an EVEN EASIER MODE! The easiest JRPG in history got even easier.. but it’s a romp the whole time. 10/10 would pay even more than $60 just for the updated soundtrack.\\n\\nPost game boss rematches are cool too. As are the in game encyclopedic features.

The whole trip she kept talking about how excited she was to get back and setup the console to play. I literally married a child. Fast forward one week, we get back and the first thing she does is set up the ps5. According to her, the setup process was fairly easy. One thing we noticed is that the screen reader is default set to on. This was a bit annoying when you didn't expect it to be defaulted to on. A quick google search showed us how to disable it. Game play is super duper smooth but you need to make sure your HDMI cable is up to date as we originally used one from 2010 so the resolution was stuck at 1080.

Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.\", '2': 'I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I’d see if it was all I’d hoped it might be. Holy freakin’ crap!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that’s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I’ve instructed it.\\n\\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I’m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I’m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I’m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn’t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\\n\\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I’ll be using like crazy.\\n\\nTonight I’m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it’s even better that I imagined.

Best little toy I’ve bought myself in years.', '3': \"I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\\n\\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\\n\\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\\n\\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\\n\\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\\n\\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\\n\\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.\", '4': \"I bought this to make sure I stayed active in my retirement years. Easy to use. Realistic beyond belief. If you wear glasses, make sure you put in the glasses spacer. You can do this by removing the black rubber around the perimeter of the mask. Start at the nose and pull up. Put in the spacer, then reattach the rubber. Makes a big difference. Favorite games are Beat Saber, 7th Guest, and the Jig saw puzzles. First time on 3D puzzles. Amazing.\\n\\nStop before you get tired, otherwise you might find yourself trying to lean against the realistic tables to rest a minute (7th Guest). You won't do it more than once! They're not really there! Have fun.\", '5': 'THIS IS FOR MY SON, HE HAD ONE AND IT BROKE... GOT HIM A NEW ONE... ONLY COMPLAINT WOULD BE THE VR IT SELF IS SMALLER AND SEEMS TO BE TIGHT AROUND THE HEAD PART.... WE COMPARED TEH OLD ONE AND NEW ONE AND IT IS INDEED A TAD SMALLER.... WE DID GET THE BATTERY ADD ON THIS TIME, AND THAT IS GREAT!!! WORKS WELL, AND BATTERY ADD ON IS GREAT.. KEEP IN MIND IF YOU HAVE HAD ONE BEFORE, AND BUY A NEW VR 2 IT IS THE SAME, BUT IS SMALLER...LITTLE TIGHT , NOT SURE WHY THEY WOULD MAKE IT SMALLER. BUT WORKS WELL!! MY SON IS VERY HAPPY!!!', '6': \"I bought this knowing the Quest 3 was out, but the price was the primary consideration for me at the time. I find this to be better or fit my needs better as I only wanted something for PCVR, and this fits the bill fine if you're seeking out for that experience without paying too much.\\n\\nWhat are some of the pros? One was that I found the overall setup experience to be seamless and relatively headache free. Second, the controllers and headset feel sturdy and well made, probably meant to withstand accidental scrapes and impacts with objects, cause that will happen regardless if you're careful with your play area. Third is the integration with Steam VR, and you can just play any games in your library from the get-go without any issues as long as you have a cable that supports the bandwidth required, or also charge while playing so you can have an extended session.\\n\\nThe only con that I have with this headset is the lack of IPD adjustability, which means I have to wear my prescription glasses and attach the spacers if I want to use the headset and not experience any blurriness. The Quest 3 has it built in as standard, but is also $200 over the MSRP of the Quest 2. It's not exactly the biggest drawback honestly, as it can vary from person to person.\", '7': \"At 26, and with a love for all things fun and techy, the Meta Quest 2 has been my latest craze. It's like unwrapping a present every time I put it on—with its vast world of games and immersive design experiences. Just a heads-up from someone who values comfort as much as a spontaneous dance-off: get the Elite Strap. It's the comfort upgrade that lets you play longer, design more, and dive deeper into VR without that 'need-a-break' feeling. Trust me, it's the smart move!\", '8': \"This was the best thing i've ordered in my life. I had tons of fun with it. The only things i dont like is the default headstrap. Its super uncomfortable. But you can always buy a new one, the... elite headstrap.\\n\\nAlso, the charger had an american outlet shape, so i couldnt stick it anywhere, but i came up with a solution and somehow fused it with one of unused cables that go with my outlet's shape and the charger works perfectly now.\", '9': \"Pros:\\n- Fairly Immersive.\\n- Amazing experiences.\\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.\\n\\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\\n\\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\\n\\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\\n\\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.\", '10': \"So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\\n\\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\\n\\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\\n\\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\\n\\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\\n\\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\\n\\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\\n\\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\\n\\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\\n\\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\\n\\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.\"}}}]}}\n"

            "        \"1\": \"Super Mario is one of the most iconic and beloved video game franchises in the world, created by Nintendo and featuring the adventures of its titular character, Mario. The series has been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for decades, and it has evolved over the years to include a wide range of games across various platforms. Here's a general review of the Super Mario series:\\n\\nGameplay: The gameplay in Super Mario games is known for its accessibility and appeal to gamers of all ages. It typically involves running and jumping through colorful and imaginative worlds, overcoming obstacles, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies. The gameplay is easy to pick up but offers depth and challenge for those looking to master it.\\n\\nGraphics and Art Style: Super Mario games have consistently featured vibrant, well-designed worlds and characters. The art style varies from game to game, but it often includes whimsical and charming visuals that are visually appealing.\\n\\nStorytelling: While the overarching story in most Super Mario games is relatively simple (Mario rescuing Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser), the charm lies in the creativity and humor that Nintendo infuses into each title. The games often feature memorable characters and plot twists.\\n\\nInnovation: The Super Mario series has been at the forefront of innovation in the gaming industry. It introduced concepts like side-scrolling platforming, 3D platforming, and motion controls (with titles like Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy). These innovations have set standards for the industry and influenced countless other games.\\n\\nMusic and Sound: Super Mario games are also known for their catchy and memorable music. Composed by Koji Kondo, the series has produced some of the most iconic video game tunes, including the original Super Mario Bros. theme.\\n\\nMultiplayer and Cooperative Play: Some Super Mario games, like the New Super Mario Bros. series and Super Mario 3D World, offer multiplayer and cooperative gameplay, allowing friends and family to join in the fun.\\n\\nLongevity: The Super Mario series has maintained its popularity for decades, and Nintendo continues to release new titles, ensuring that both longtime fans and new players have a constant stream of Mario adventures to enjoy.\\n\\nCritic and Fan Reception: Super Mario games have consistently received critical acclaim, with many titles earning high review scores. They have also garnered a massive and dedicated fan base.\\n\\nOverall, the Super Mario series is a testament to the enduring appeal of video games.

Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer, there's likely a Super Mario game that will provide hours of entertainment and joy.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family's favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nFrom the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey's Cappy or Mario Sunshine's FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don't need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren't quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.\\n\\nGraphics:\\nGraphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.\\n\\nControls:\\nThe controls, for the most part, are what you'd expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn't notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.\\n\\nCo-op:\\nThe co-op mode is where \\\"Super Mario Wonder\\\" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don't receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.\\n\\nOverall Assessment:\\nSuper Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I'll update as we continue our adventure...\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.\\n\\nMy first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn\\u2019t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.\\n\\nWhen Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I\\u2019d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn\\u2019t been playing any games as of late.\\n\\nAll that to say, this game is simply wonderful. \\u201cWonder\\u201d was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.\\n\\nThe gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can\\u2019t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can\\u2019t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario\\u2019s, but I\\u2019m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It\\u2019s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.\\n\\n10/10\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Introduction:\\nAs a self-proclaimed cool dad with a lifelong love for video games, I was excited to dive into the Mario Wonder Switch Game. Mario has been a part of my gaming journey since I was a kid, and I couldn't wait to see what this new title had to offer. In this in-depth review, I'll share my insights and experiences playing the game from a cool dad's perspective.\\n\\nGameplay and Mechanics:\\nThe gameplay of Mario Wonder Switch is nothing short of magical. It captures the classic Mario charm while introducing innovative mechanics. The variety of power-ups, from the Super Mushroom to the new Wonder Suit, adds a layer of fun and excitement. The controls are responsive and intuitive, making it easy for both veteran gamers and newcomers to enjoy. The level design is masterful, offering a balanced blend of nostalgic elements and fresh challenges that keep me and my kids engaged for hours.\\n\\nGraphics and Art Style:\\nThe visuals in Mario Wonder Switch are a visual treat. The vibrant, colorful world of the Mushroom Kingdom is brought to life with stunning detail and animations. The game's art style combines the best of modern graphics technology with the timeless charm of Mario, resulting in a delightful visual experience that leaves a smile on my face and my kids' faces.\\n\\nStory and Adventure:\\nMario games have never been renowned for their intricate stories, but Mario Wonder Switch delivers a fun and engaging narrative. The story, while simple, adds a layer of motivation to the game. The adventure takes you through various captivating worlds, each brimming with unique challenges and quirky characters. The game keeps the excitement alive by introducing twists and turns that you won't see coming.\\n\\nMultiplayer Fun:\\nOne of the highlights for a cool dad is the multiplayer experience, and Mario Wonder Switch doesn't disappoint. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows my kids and me to team up and enjoy the game together. It's a fantastic way to bond with them while solving puzzles, battling foes, and working as a team. The competitive mode is also a blast for some healthy family rivalry.\\n\\nNostalgia Factor:\\nBeing a lifelong Mario fan, I appreciate the nods to the franchise's history. Mario Wonder Switch includes various references and throwbacks to earlier titles, making it a nostalgia trip for me. It's a pleasure to share these moments with my kids and tell them about the good old days of gaming.\\n\\nReplay Value:\\nThe game's extensive content and collectibles add significant replay value. Exploring every nook and cranny, hunting for Power Moons, and trying to achieve 100% completion is a journey that keeps the fun going long after the main story is completed. It's a game that we keep coming back to, providing lasting value and entertainment.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nMario Wonder Switch is a marvelous addition to the Mario franchise, and it has certainly lived up to the hype. As a cool dad, it's been an absolute joy to share this gaming experience with my kids. The gameplay, graphics, story, and multiplayer options make it an all-around fantastic game that bridges the generation gap. Mario continues to be the ultimate family-friendly game, and Mario Wonder Switch is no exception. It's a game that cements Mario's status as a beloved icon for all ages.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"So I have to say that I was almost disappointed months ago to learn that Nintendo was making another 2D Mario game. The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I\\u2019ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn\\u2019t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I\\u2019m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn\\u2019t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn\\u2019t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I\\u2019m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it\\u2019s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I\\u2019d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!! Get this game. You won\\u2019t be disappointed. 10/10\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Knowing Nintendo and what they do, I want to make sure I acquire an actual physical copy of their first party titles. This is a great game. No more \\\"new\\\" deviations to the Mario 2D platform games. It has a fresh look and gameplay. There is plenty to do in the game and great for picking it up and playing every now and then without having to understand some complicated storyline or starting the entire game over.\\n\\nI have just one gripe. There is a slight bit of disappointment when I rip off the plastic wrapping and opening the game case in anticipation. There is no manual, no map, no poster, no swag. There are clips for it but nothing there. I open it and there's just a tiny game card/cartridge at the bottom. It just feels empty. At least put some kind of advertisement for your other games in it, Nintendo. It's a missed opportunity.\",\n",

It's like playing in a living, breathing cartoon world, and it's utterly captivating.\\n\\nThe gameplay is where the real magic happens. Whether you're jumping on Goombas, collecting coins, or discovering hidden power-ups, it's an exhilarating experience that takes me back to the nostalgia of my childhood. And the controls on the Nintendo Switch are so intuitive; it's gaming bliss.\\n\\nOne of my favorite scenarios is playing this game with friends. It's pure multiplayer fun! Competing in challenges, cooperating on tough levels, or simply exploring together - it's a blast every time.\\n\\nThe replay value is outstanding. With so many levels and secrets to uncover, I find myself coming back for more, each time with a sense of wonder and anticipation.\",\n",

So when Nintendo came out with this game this year, I jumped for joy. It has so many cool features, including having different gaming experiences with each character you play as, which results in essentially an infinite number of different playing experiences. So cool. Buy. It.\",\n",

While most of the levels were easier than the average super Mario bros levels, there were quite a few levels that would definitely make our list of most challenging levels (the top level being 9-2 of super Mario bros deluxe). The concepts were new but easy to understand and reminded us of the joy these games brought us growing up. Whether you are debating on getting this for your kids or getting it to play as an adult, I would definitely add this to your collection regardless of your skill background.\"\n",

            "        \"5\": \"OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.\",\n",

The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I\\u2019ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn\\u2019t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I\\u2019m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn\\u2019t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn\\u2019t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I\\u2019m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it\\u2019s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I\\u2019d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!!

There is a slight bit of disappointment when I rip off the plastic wrapping and opening the game case in anticipation. There is no manual, no map, no poster, no swag. There are clips for it but nothing there. I open it and there's just a tiny game card/cartridge at the bottom. It just feels empty.

The games often feature memorable characters and plot twists.\\n\\nInnovation: The Super Mario series has been at the forefront of innovation in the gaming industry. It introduced concepts like side-scrolling platforming, 3D platforming, and motion controls (with titles like Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy).

Composed by Koji Kondo, the series has produced some of the most iconic video game tunes, including the original Super Mario Bros. theme.\\n\\nMultiplayer and Cooperative Play: Some Super Mario games, like the New Super Mario Bros. series and Super Mario 3D World, offer multiplayer and cooperative gameplay, allowing friends and family to join in the fun.\\n\\nLongevity: The Super Mario series has maintained its popularity for decades, and Nintendo continues to release new titles, ensuring that both longtime fans and new players have a constant stream of Mario adventures to enjoy.\\n\\nCritic and Fan Reception: Super Mario games have consistently received critical acclaim, with many titles earning high review scores.

            "        \"2\": \"Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family's favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nFrom the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey's Cappy or Mario Sunshine's FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don't need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren't quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.\\n\\nGraphics:\\nGraphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.\\n\\nControls:\\nThe controls, for the most part, are what you'd expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn't notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.\\n\\nCo-op:\\nThe co-op mode is where \\\"Super Mario Wonder\\\" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don't receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.\\n\\nOverall Assessment:\\nSuper Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I'll update as we continue our adventure...\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.\\n\\nMy first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn\\u2019t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.\\n\\nWhen Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I\\u2019d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn\\u2019t been playing any games as of late.\\n\\nAll that to say, this game is simply wonderful. \\u201cWonder\\u201d was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.\\n\\nThe gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can\\u2019t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can\\u2019t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario\\u2019s, but I\\u2019m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It\\u2019s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.\\n\\n10/10\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Introduction:\\nAs a self-proclaimed cool dad with a lifelong love for video games, I was excited to dive into the Mario Wonder Switch Game. Mario has been a part of my gaming journey since I was a kid, and I couldn't wait to see what this new title had to offer. In this in-depth review, I'll share my insights and experiences playing the game from a cool dad's perspective.\\n\\nGameplay and Mechanics:\\nThe gameplay of Mario Wonder Switch is nothing short of magical. It captures the classic Mario charm while introducing innovative mechanics. The variety of power-ups, from the Super Mushroom to the new Wonder Suit, adds a layer of fun and excitement. The controls are responsive and intuitive, making it easy for both veteran gamers and newcomers to enjoy. The level design is masterful, offering a balanced blend of nostalgic elements and fresh challenges that keep me and my kids engaged for hours.\\n\\nGraphics and Art Style:\\nThe visuals in Mario Wonder Switch are a visual treat. The vibrant, colorful world of the Mushroom Kingdom is brought to life with stunning detail and animations. The game's art style combines the best of modern graphics technology with the timeless charm of Mario, resulting in a delightful visual experience that leaves a smile on my face and my kids' faces.\\n\\nStory and Adventure:\\nMario games have never been renowned for their intricate stories, but Mario Wonder Switch delivers a fun and engaging narrative. The story, while simple, adds a layer of motivation to the game. The adventure takes you through various captivating worlds, each brimming with unique challenges and quirky characters. The game keeps the excitement alive by introducing twists and turns that you won't see coming.\\n\\nMultiplayer Fun:\\nOne of the highlights for a cool dad is the multiplayer experience, and Mario Wonder Switch doesn't disappoint. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows my kids and me to team up and enjoy the game together. It's a fantastic way to bond with them while solving puzzles, battling foes, and working as a team. The competitive mode is also a blast for some healthy family rivalry.\\n\\nNostalgia Factor:\\nBeing a lifelong Mario fan, I appreciate the nods to the franchise's history. Mario Wonder Switch includes various references and throwbacks to earlier titles, making it a nostalgia trip for me. It's a pleasure to share these moments with my kids and tell them about the good old days of gaming.\\n\\nReplay Value:\\nThe game's extensive content and collectibles add significant replay value. Exploring every nook and cranny, hunting for Power Moons, and trying to achieve 100% completion is a journey that keeps the fun going long after the main story is completed. It's a game that we keep coming back to, providing lasting value and entertainment.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nMario Wonder Switch is a marvelous addition to the Mario franchise, and it has certainly lived up to the hype. As a cool dad, it's been an absolute joy to share this gaming experience with my kids. The gameplay, graphics, story, and multiplayer options make it an all-around fantastic game that bridges the generation gap.

            "        \"5\": \"OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.\",\n",

The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I\\u2019ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn\\u2019t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I\\u2019m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn\\u2019t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn\\u2019t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I\\u2019m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it\\u2019s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I\\u2019d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!!

            "        \"4\": \"Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.\\n\\nMy first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn\\u2019t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.\\n\\nWhen Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I\\u2019d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn\\u2019t been playing any games as of late.\\n\\nAll that to say, this game is simply wonderful. \\u201cWonder\\u201d was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.\\n\\nThe gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can\\u2019t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can\\u2019t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario\\u2019s, but I\\u2019m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It\\u2019s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.\\n\\n10/10\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.\",\n",

Whether you're jumping on Goombas, collecting coins, or discovering hidden power-ups, it's an exhilarating experience that takes me back to the nostalgia of my childhood. And the controls on the Nintendo Switch are so intuitive; it's gaming bliss.\\n\\nOne of my favorite scenarios is playing this game with friends. It's pure multiplayer fun! Competing in challenges, cooperating on tough levels, or simply exploring together - it's a blast every time.\\n\\nThe replay value is outstanding. With so many levels and secrets to uncover, I find myself coming back for more, each time with a sense of wonder and anticipation.\",\n",

The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I\\u2019ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn\\u2019t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I\\u2019m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn\\u2019t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn\\u2019t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I\\u2019m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it\\u2019s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I\\u2019d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!!

So when Nintendo came out with this game this year, I jumped for joy. It has so many cool features, including having different gaming experiences with each character you play as, which results in essentially an infinite number of different playing experiences. So cool.

            "        \"1\": \"Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family's favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nFrom the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey's Cappy or Mario Sunshine's FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don't need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren't quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.\\n\\nGraphics:\\nGraphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.\\n\\nControls:\\nThe controls, for the most part, are what you'd expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn't notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.\\n\\nCo-op:\\nThe co-op mode is where \\\"Super Mario Wonder\\\" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don't receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.\\n\\nOverall Assessment:\\nSuper Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I'll update as we continue our adventure...\",\n",

            "        \"2\": \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the US Version is an absolute gaming masterpiece that lives up to its title as the \\\"ultimate\\\" fighting game. This game brings together an extensive roster of iconic characters from various video game franchises, creating a thrilling and action-packed gaming experience like no other.\\n\\nThe gameplay is fast-paced, fluid, and incredibly fun. Each character has a unique set of moves and abilities, allowing for diverse and strategic battles. Whether playing with friends locally or challenging opponents online, the game offers endless hours of entertainment and competition.\\n\\nThe attention to detail in the game is remarkable, from the meticulously designed stages inspired by classic video games to the faithfully recreated character models and animations. The visuals are crisp and vibrant, adding to the immersive gaming experience.\\n\\nThe game's sound design is exceptional, with a dynamic soundtrack that features remixes of iconic video game tunes. The audio enhances the excitement of battles and nostalgia for fans of the various franchises represented.\\n\\nOne of the most significant strengths of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is its replay value. The game's single-player modes, online multiplayer battles, and numerous unlockable characters and spirits ensure that players will keep coming back for more.\",\n",

Fighting might happen in real life if one person just wrecks everyone else. Emotions will get tested, tears possible, friendships might get ruined, but it is all worth it if you win the battle! You need ppl around you to sharpen your skills.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Nintendo once again does not disappoint! This one is just as fun and addicting as the last one, but with every character from every Smash Bros game that came before, this one upset the stakes. Fantastic game! Definitely one of the best ever made! Certainly the best Smash game in my opinion.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Pros:\\nThe World of Light adventure mode is fantastic. Not only is it really fun to play with the addition of a progression system with the spirits, skill tree, and unlocking more fighters, but it also quite long and will take you many hours to fully play through. I actually quite enjoyed the spirit system and the many different spirit fights seem diverse enough that it doesn't really start to bore me. Maybe the only problem is the varied difficulty of fights. Most fights are insanely easy after you have a decent full leveled spirit, even on the highest difficulty, but you can always purposefully handicap yourself by using a weaker spirit if that's your thing. But also some of the fights were so insanely difficult and unfair that switching down to \\\"easy\\\" mode still made the fight take me 30 minutes of replaying to beat (and I'm pretty decent at the game). Honestly it wasn't even a downside for me I enjoyed the challenge and it wasn't a necessary fight for progressing.\\nHuge character pool this time around. \\\"Everyone is here!\\\" Not an exaggeration over 80 characters will be on the roster after dlc and counting Pokemon trainer as multiple fighters. Obviously some of those are just slightly different echo fighters, but the diversity is still great. Just quick unlocking characters by restarting, unlocking, and restarting again took a long time. All the characters look great and feel great to play and play vs, though I haven't been able to use all of the extensively yet.\\nI'm not a pro player by any stretch, but the fighting mechanics feel fluid and the engine seems well polished. I love that the heavy characters have been buffed by having their lag time for aerials and landing reduced. I like them making perfect shield harder/different as it will give pros something to develop skill wise as well. Hopefully the pro scene will be able to make something of this game as smash 4 was a bit of a let down (won't even talk about brawl).\\nThey also made training mode better, and allow you to play the game while waiting for an online match, but many other parts of online are less than desirable.\\n\\nCons:\\nOnline mode is kind of taking a back seat here. I was really hoping we would be getting a more fine tuned and more competition oriented online mode, but got the opposite. They made online mode a for fun system, which I understand is the direction Sakurai wants to take with the game, but I just don't understand why they couldn't have given their competitive community a bone here. Online match making no longer has a For Glory mode. There is simply casual mode with a matchmaking system that puts you up against someone near your skill level based on an elo system on a per fighter basis. It also matches you with some with a game rule similar to your own, but not exact.... this has made me go into what I thought was a 1v1 no items match into an assist trophy free for all nightmare. This is also going to continue to create debates as to what the \\\"official\\\" competitive rule set will be for 1v1 online play.\\n\\nOverall the game is a great experience and was definitely worth the purchase and worth the wait. Tons of replayablity and fun for all levels of players.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"Definitely my favorite Smash Bros entry of the entire series. One could even say it's the \\\"Ultimate\\\" version of the game. It can be played for hours with friends and I've even enjoyed playing on my own, though that isn't quite as fun as playing with a group of friends and family.\\n\\nI will admit it can be a confusing game to jump right in to if you've never played a Smash Bros game before. However, it can be enjoyed by little kids and adults alike. Make sure to watch the \\\"How to Play\\\" video after the intro to the game to get a basic idea of how the game works. These games have a pretty unique take on the fighting game genre, so I'll leave a basic summary below.\\n\\nThe goal is to knock your opponents off the edge of the screen to reduce their lives. As you hit your opponent their percentage goes up. The higher that percentage is, the farther they will fly away when attacked. When a character is knocked out, they come back at 0% and continue battling until time runs out or they run out of stock/lives.\\n\\nEach character (there are 74!) has different kinds of moves, strengths, and weaknesses. There are multiple items, modes, and stages/levels in the game. The best way to learn it all is just to play. You'll quickly find characters you enjoy playing as and develop a fighting style that's all your own.\\n\\nI realize I haven't said much about the game yet, but there is so much going for it that it's hard to pick things out. The music, sheer number of stages and characters, and overall polish to the game is astounding. In terms of changes between previous versions of the game, some of my favorite things are:\\n\\n1) The physics of the game are the best so far. Its crisp, fast paced, and not as floaty as Brawl. Knocking people away, trying to get back to the stage, and performing combos just feels so fluid.\\n2) Setting custom rulesets. I have my default 3 stock no items for 1 on 1 or true skill matches. I have a 3 stock all items high and smash meter on for the free for all party play. You can set the rules up whatever way you like and set a preset which makes getting in to play that much faster.\\n3) Starting with the original 8 characters and unlocking all the new ones is actually really fun for me and never felt like a chore. Anyone complaining about this part must not remember what it was like to get Mewtwo (20 hours of vs matches) or Game and Watch (1000 vs matches) in Melee or Wolf in Brawl (450 matches). In this mode you get the chance to beat and unlock a challenger every 10 minutes of VS play, or even quicker if you reset the switch after every match. You also face a challenger every time you finish classic mode, or throughout the new Spirits mode in World of Light. It really is fun to watch the roster grow, and doesn't really feel all that grindy unless you are in a huge rush to unlock every one. If there is a character you really want, look up the charts that show you who unlocks who in Classic mode and you can have the character you want within 30 minutes easy.\\n4) Slow-mo on knockout hits, extra damage in 1v1, the overlaid out of bounds box when someone went flying, and the smoke trailing characters matching their color are all huge quality of life improvements.\\n5) Everything? I could go on and on. I love this game. Within a night of playing it was without a doubt my favorite game of the series.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Arguably, sometimes when it comes to gems for the Nintendo Switch, I sometimes head backwards & give them a chance rather than playing them at the moment. Arguably, I have been more of a light fan of the Super Smash Brothers series than a hard core one. I have played prior Super Smash Brothers games with the arcade fighting fun against the great foes like Master Hand & more updated characters like Ganondorf & Mega Man. Arguably, trying to head back into the franchise is definitely a challenge, but had some things that worked well, where others could've worked better. After finally getting to play Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate, I can finally say this is one of the best multiplayer games to master.\\n\\nSuper Smash Brothers: Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch is one of the best multiplayer experiences you can get, right behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. You have a lengthy amount of content here, where you match & play against as many as 80 characters like Sonic The Hedgehog, Kirby, Luigi, Mario & Wario. This game has a lot of great matches that you can play & stages that celebrate video games' past like Green Hill Zone from Sonic The Hedgehog, the Metroid underworld, where you're battling with Mother Brain in the background. There are many different multiplayer fights with 100 smash battle & custom traditional fighting arcade modes for each character in the arcade mode.\\n\\nBut where the game does shine, but truthfully shines too bright is the World Of Light adventure mode. Where you start as Kirby & he has to travel to unlock multiple fighters as you play the game to try & challenge the dark & light worlds where he can match against classic Smash Brothers foes like Crazy Hand, Giga Bowser & forgotten Nintendo enemies like Mark from the Kirby franchise & Dracula from the Castlevania franchise. The story feels kind of lightweight, where the content is good. I have found the game is fun, but could've been simplified in the end. Sometimes, navigating through the spirit trails can be frustrating & feels more like a exhaustion rather than a strength. But for easier gamers, you can simply tone down the difficulty to make your run though a bit easier. Graphically, the game looks great & has strong music to enjoy, but the control is easy to maintain, but can simply vary during challenges you play within the adventure mode. Still, multiplayer makes the control customizable & easier to maintain.\\n\\nThere are a few disadvantages with the game though. One of them happens to be the Word Of Light. The world looks great, but it doesn't feel as cinematic as prior Super Smash Brothers titles. I actually thought the subspace embessary from Super Smash Brothers: Brawl was a bit more engaging & compelling to play. Another disadvantage is in the level changer where you add fog, swap gravity & add partner foes to help win matches is honestly tedious & can change the matches drastically. When I found out that the stage made a flip upside down to the point that I had to perform the fight in a mirror style by making my controller go left, so I could make the fighter head right to where I could win a match. Arguably, it was very exhausting & caused me to feel drained in the end.\\n\\nWhether you have played Super Smash Brothers in the past, or other fighting games like Street Fighter V, there is a lot to play & have fun with while playing Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate. It is a great game, but more of a circus for excitement with matches with friends & contests. The single player adventure mode is a challenge that does work, but can quite easily drive you down rather than lift you up overall. Still, it is a step up from the failure of the Smash Brothers game on Wii U. So get yourself revved up out of your corner & fight.\\n\\nGraphics: B+\\n\\nSound: B 1/2+\\n\\nControl: B\\n\\nFun & Enjoyment: B- for solo play; B+ for multiplayer\\n\\nOverall: B 1/2+\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"This is the classic super fun Mario game. The whole family loves it. Highly recommend.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Let me begin by saying Super Smash Bros. has always been a fighting game franchise I've held dear since my childhood. Each new entry seemed to completely raise the bar, thereby raising my expectations for what kind of surprises were in store for us. And as far as the character reveals go, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate boasted a good amount of surprises for the fans. Lots of heavily requested fighters such as King K. Rool, Ridley and Simon Belmont finally graced the roster. However, I just don't see how they can call this the \\\"Ultimate\\\" version of Smash when so much was taken out in exchange for a larger than normal stage and fighter number. So this brings me to the ultimate question (sorry for the overuse of the word \\\"ultimate\\\" btw). Was what we gained better than what we lost? That's a difficult question for me to answer. Instead, I'll just spill my thoughts. Let's continue with the review.\\n\\nPart 1: Presentation. The formula of Super Smash Bros has remained relatively the same since its debut in 1999. Its control scheme is pretty unique for a fighting game. But, it works excellently. There are no 15-button combos, but a series of standard, special, and aerial attacks that can be used in whichever sequence you see fit. The objective of the game is to rack up damage on your opponents by beating them to a pulp using your wide variety of moves, items, assists etc. and then launching them off the stage. I simply adore the chaotic gameplay of Smash bros. and so do millions of people, hence the large fanbase. However, there are some people in this world who have never played a Smash game before (shocking, right?). I just feel the game could do a better job in presenting itself to newcomers. The \\\"how to play\\\" video doesn't show up until after the game's opening. How will people know to wait after the logo comes on the screen? Other than that, the menu is very clean and straightforward this time around. It only takes 3 button presses to get into a match with you and your buds. I also want to take this time and applaud the beautiful design of the menus. There is a nice mix between simplistic graphics and in-game images. It honestly deserves an award. Not only that, its easier than ever to add up to 8 players to a match, set up custom match rules and edit controller configurations. So much care went into making the experience pleasurable.\\n\\nPart 2: Gameplay. Like I mentioned above, the gameplay of Smash Bros. remained the same. But, this time around, the overall speed has been upped a bit, making the gameplay a tad faster than Smash 4, but a tad slower than Melee. And I gotta say, it really feels great. Since the speed of the game changed, so did some of the animations of the fighters. Taunts, for instance, are quicker and don't leave you vulnerable for as long. And when you launch a fighter, they propel a lot faster and a lot farther. This makes it a bit harder to execute combos, sadly. Despite the faster gameplay, I am AMAZED at how fluid the movements of the fighters still are, as well as how nicely animated some of their new moves are. This game runs at a buttery-smooth 60 fps, despite all the chaos happening on the screen. I'd give this game an A+ in this department. It's not hard to understand why the gameplay of Smash hasn't changed. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\n\\nPart 3: Content. This is where things get dicey. One could argue that having 70+ characters and 100+ stage options qualifies as a hefty amount of content. However,a lot-and I mean ALOT of the features/modes from the prior smash bros. games have been cut. I'm going to start by telling you what you get with this game. There is your standard \\\"Smash\\\" mode, which houses local multiplayer matches. Standard Smash is for 2-8 players. If you have an even larger group of people wanting to play, you'll be glad to know there's a tournament mode. A new multiplayer mode called \\\"squad strike\\\" makes its debut in this game. In this mode, you can challenge a buddy and both of you use a \\\"squad\\\" of 3 or 5 characters to participate in elimination-style matches. Other than that, you can also mess around with the rules in the multiplayer matches. The mode \\\"special\\\" smash makes a return. Playing this mode, will allow you to fight with a variety of battle parameters (make your fighter faint after taking a certain amount of damage, make your fighters large, make them metallic, etc). Next, we have \\\"Spirits mode\\\", which houses this game's campaign mode, \\\"World of Light\\\". This could take a while to wrap up, so i'll try to be brief. Those of you who are familiar with Smash Bros may remember collecting \\\"trophies\\\" which are in-game collectible 3D models of characters who are both in and not in the game. In prior games, there were tons of ways you could unlock trophies, which added hours upon hours of more content. In this game, trophies are gone, but their spirits are carried through...well, spirits. The whole gimmick of \\\"Spirits mode\\\" is fighting,collecting and leveling up spirits, which are obtained by completing matches with a plethora of wacky parameters. So, what are spirits? They're basically the souls of characters who appeared in various games. In this game, they're represented by flat 2D images, rather than 3D models like the trophies were. When you \\\"equip\\\" a spirit, you attain its powers, which in some way, are related to the spirit itself. In super smash bros. brawl for wii, you may remember \\\"stickers\\\", which are almost the exact same thing, but you can't level them up. The whole mechanic of \\\"spirits\\\" is fully brought into play in the \\\"World of Light\\\" campaign mode. This time around, a new foe named \\\"Galeem\\\" has reared his ugly head and claimed the bodies of all the fighters (except Kirby) and is making clones of them. To make these clones fight, he uses the spirits he claimed from non-important characters and embeds them into the clones so that they become animate. Your job is to rescue all of your fallen comrades and restore light to the world. In this mode, you traverse a large, and I mean LARGE map, taking on the clones (with spirits inside them) in a variety of silly matches. Should you beat the clone at their own game, you free the spirit within and you can use their powers to help you free more spirits. Spirits are leveled up naturally by fighting. The better you do in a fight, the more EXP your spirit gets. Playing a good match can also net you \\\"skill points\\\" which can be used to unlock extra stats on top of the ones you get with spirits. When you travel across the map, you will run into your comrades being held captive. If you defeat them in a regular match, you will free them and that means you not only get to use then in World of Light, but in every other mode in the game as well. Each section of World of Light's map has a boss. Defeat that boss and you're one step closer to confronting Galeem. Anyway, you keep going through the cycle of fighting,rescuing spirits,rescuing fighters and taking down bosses for the whole campaign mode. I have yet to complete this mode, but it goes on for a while. My gripe with \\\"World of Light\\\" is that it becomes repetitive after a while. These matches with the crazy battle parameters make up about 90% of the campaign and are, in theory, just matches that you can replicate by messing around with the rules in \\\"Smash mode\\\". This honestly feels like event matches with an unnecessary rpg mechanic slapped on it. Also, the difficulty is all over the place. Some matches are fairly easy and in others, you'll get your can kicked to and fro. Anyhoo, let's keep going. Next, we have \\\"Classic Mode\\\", which is no stranger to us Smash fans. In this mode, you select a character, take on a series of matches and fight a boss at the end. However, this classic mode is a bit different than the \\\"classic\\\" modes we're used to. And by \\\"different\\\", I mean worse. First off, classic mode has been shortened by like 5 matches. Second, there is only one bonus game that you play between matches, and its the same for every fighter and every difficulty you choose. It's a little obstacle course where you collect yellow orbs and race to the end before a black hole swallows you. I just don't understand why they couldn't have at least added different layouts for the obstacle course. In prior games, there were \\\"break the targets\\\" bonus stages that had multiple layouts. Lastly, classic mode ends with a boss. **SPOILER ALERT IN 3...2....1...(SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED)There are only 6 bosses in the game. And in a game with over 70 characters, this means you'll be fighting the same ones over and over. And lo and behold, these are the EXACT six bosses you'll fight in the campaign mode.\\n\\n**SPOILERS OVER**Alright, next I want to cover the online mode. I knew from when it was first unveiled, it would be a mess and I was right. There is no longer the \\\"For fun\\\" and \\\"For Glory\\\" options that were in Smash Bros. for Wii U. There is only the Quickplay option in which you set your match preferences and HOPE you and another player have the same idea of a good match. More often than not, you will be forced to play in 4-player matches if you don't want to play 4-player matches and 1-on-1 matches when you don't feel like playing a 1-on-1. Also, there is noticeable lag (Oh boy, what a surprise) when playing online. Apparently, the game does its best to set you up against players close to you, but if one player has bad internet, everyone suffers.\\n\\nPart 4(UPDATED AS OF AUGUST 2019):The Cutting Board. This is where I want to talk about features than many considered to be standard for Smash games, but for some reason, don't show up in Ultimate. My main problem with this game is that I feel Nintendo stripped the extra content and modes that made Smash Bros. a truly enjoyable experience, leaving behind what the game is at its core: a party fighting game. Nintendo seems to be on this trend lately with games like Mario Tennis Aces, ARMS, Star Fox Zero and Mario Kart 8, where modes that offered a great subsidiary to the main gameplay formula (multiplayer modes, mini game modes, battle modes etc) that were present in PAST TITLES are nowhere to be seen. And I absolutely HATE that Smash had to be a part of this trend. And this most disappointing part of this is that the Switch is Nintendo's 2nd HD game console. We should be getting games that absolutely push the boundaries of what past games were restricted to. Other developers are making their sequels bigger and better, but for some reason, Nintendo is holding back content from their games. It just doesn't make sense. It's as if whenever they take 1 step forward, they have to take 2 steps back. Sorry for the small rant, here are the features that Smash Ultimate lacks. First, mini-games like \\\"Break the Targets\\\", \\\"board the platforms\\\" and \\\"Home run contest\\\" are absent. I feel these games would have been PERFECT for an online leader board functionality. Second, Single player modes like \\\"All-star\\\" and \\\"event match\\\" are absent.\\nUPDATE: Stage Builder mode, which was a feature of the last 2 Smash games, was added via an update and it's amazing how much care went into designing the new components and objects you can play around with. This stage builder easily trumps the other two. Not only that, Tournament mode was added. I' ve decided to bump up my rating by one star to accommodate these additions. Thanks for listening to the fans, Mr. Sakurai.\\n\\nLastly, I want to talk about unlocking methods. You start the game with the original 8 characters that you started with in the Nintendo 64 game, yet all of the stages are unlocked. This baffling to me. In prior smash games, you would have to unlock stages and characters by completing certain requirements. Some of which were very unique and creative, making unlocking the character/stage a truly rewarding experience. With Ultimate, all of that is gone. You simply unlock characters by playing multiplayer matches, classic mode matches or via the \\\"World of Light\\\" campaign. If you want to bring back the nostalgic feel of putting effort towards unlocking something, you need to do it with the stages as well.\\n\\nPart 5: The verdict: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a truly great game at its core. Its gameplay has even been tweaked and refined, further enhancing the experience. However, most of what you'll be doing in this game is playing standard matches, whether it be against a CPU or a few buddies. Many of us were looking forward to a fully fleshed-out adventure mode, but its basically a series of event matches-something we've seen before. And all of the great passtimes like home-run batting, trophy collecting,\\\"break the targets\\\" or stage building are nowhere to be seen. And the one mode we do have that was present in past games, \\\"Classic\\\" mode has been watered down. By no means am I saying this is a terrible game. It's just that I was expected what added to the charm of Smash Bros. to be included in this installment. And I'm very well sure the developers know that we sometimes can't get everything we want. I don't feel ripped off, because there is very well $60 worth of content in this game. And with the addition of fan favorite characters like Banjo-Kazooie coming soon, I am very grateful to the dedication of the development team. Thanks for reading and happy gaming.\",\n",

Each character has a unique set of moves and abilities, allowing for diverse and strategic battles. Whether playing with friends locally or challenging opponents online, the game offers endless hours of entertainment and competition.\\n\\nThe attention to detail in the game is remarkable, from the meticulously designed stages inspired by classic video games to the faithfully recreated character models and animations. The visuals are crisp and vibrant, adding to the immersive gaming experience.\\n\\nThe game's sound design is exceptional, with a dynamic soundtrack that features remixes of iconic video game tunes. The audio enhances the excitement of battles and nostalgia for fans of the various franchises represented.\\n\\nOne of the most significant strengths of Super Smash Bros.

            "        \"4\": \"Nintendo once again does not disappoint! This one is just as fun and addicting as the last one, but with every character from every Smash Bros game that came before, this one upset the stakes. Fantastic game! Definitely one of the best ever made! Certainly the best Smash game in my opinion.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Pros:\\nThe World of Light adventure mode is fantastic. Not only is it really fun to play with the addition of a progression system with the spirits, skill tree, and unlocking more fighters, but it also quite long and will take you many hours to fully play through. I actually quite enjoyed the spirit system and the many different spirit fights seem diverse enough that it doesn't really start to bore me. Maybe the only problem is the varied difficulty of fights. Most fights are insanely easy after you have a decent full leveled spirit, even on the highest difficulty, but you can always purposefully handicap yourself by using a weaker spirit if that's your thing. But also some of the fights were so insanely difficult and unfair that switching down to \\\"easy\\\" mode still made the fight take me 30 minutes of replaying to beat (and I'm pretty decent at the game). Honestly it wasn't even a downside for me I enjoyed the challenge and it wasn't a necessary fight for progressing.\\nHuge character pool this time around. \\\"Everyone is here!\\\" Not an exaggeration over 80 characters will be on the roster after dlc and counting Pokemon trainer as multiple fighters. Obviously some of those are just slightly different echo fighters, but the diversity is still great. Just quick unlocking characters by restarting, unlocking, and restarting again took a long time. All the characters look great and feel great to play and play vs, though I haven't been able to use all of the extensively yet.\\nI'm not a pro player by any stretch, but the fighting mechanics feel fluid and the engine seems well polished. I love that the heavy characters have been buffed by having their lag time for aerials and landing reduced. I like them making perfect shield harder/different as it will give pros something to develop skill wise as well. Hopefully the pro scene will be able to make something of this game as smash 4 was a bit of a let down (won't even talk about brawl).\\nThey also made training mode better, and allow you to play the game while waiting for an online match, but many other parts of online are less than desirable.\\n\\nCons:\\nOnline mode is kind of taking a back seat here. I was really hoping we would be getting a more fine tuned and more competition oriented online mode, but got the opposite. They made online mode a for fun system, which I understand is the direction Sakurai wants to take with the game, but I just don't understand why they couldn't have given their competitive community a bone here. Online match making no longer has a For Glory mode. There is simply casual mode with a matchmaking system that puts you up against someone near your skill level based on an elo system on a per fighter basis. It also matches you with some with a game rule similar to your own, but not exact.... this has made me go into what I thought was a 1v1 no items match into an assist trophy free for all nightmare. This is also going to continue to create debates as to what the \\\"official\\\" competitive rule set will be for 1v1 online play.\\n\\nOverall the game is a great experience and was definitely worth the purchase and worth the wait. Tons of replayablity and fun for all levels of players.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"Definitely my favorite Smash Bros entry of the entire series. One could even say it's the \\\"Ultimate\\\" version of the game. It can be played for hours with friends and I've even enjoyed playing on my own, though that isn't quite as fun as playing with a group of friends and family.\\n\\nI will admit it can be a confusing game to jump right in to if you've never played a Smash Bros game before. However, it can be enjoyed by little kids and adults alike. Make sure to watch the \\\"How to Play\\\" video after the intro to the game to get a basic idea of how the game works. These games have a pretty unique take on the fighting game genre, so I'll leave a basic summary below.\\n\\nThe goal is to knock your opponents off the edge of the screen to reduce their lives. As you hit your opponent their percentage goes up. The higher that percentage is, the farther they will fly away when attacked. When a character is knocked out, they come back at 0% and continue battling until time runs out or they run out of stock/lives.\\n\\nEach character (there are 74!) has different kinds of moves, strengths, and weaknesses. There are multiple items, modes, and stages/levels in the game. The best way to learn it all is just to play. You'll quickly find characters you enjoy playing as and develop a fighting style that's all your own.\\n\\nI realize I haven't said much about the game yet, but there is so much going for it that it's hard to pick things out. The music, sheer number of stages and characters, and overall polish to the game is astounding. In terms of changes between previous versions of the game, some of my favorite things are:\\n\\n1) The physics of the game are the best so far. Its crisp, fast paced, and not as floaty as Brawl. Knocking people away, trying to get back to the stage, and performing combos just feels so fluid.\\n2) Setting custom rulesets. I have my default 3 stock no items for 1 on 1 or true skill matches. I have a 3 stock all items high and smash meter on for the free for all party play. You can set the rules up whatever way you like and set a preset which makes getting in to play that much faster.\\n3) Starting with the original 8 characters and unlocking all the new ones is actually really fun for me and never felt like a chore. Anyone complaining about this part must not remember what it was like to get Mewtwo (20 hours of vs matches) or Game and Watch (1000 vs matches) in Melee or Wolf in Brawl (450 matches). In this mode you get the chance to beat and unlock a challenger every 10 minutes of VS play, or even quicker if you reset the switch after every match. You also face a challenger every time you finish classic mode, or throughout the new Spirits mode in World of Light. It really is fun to watch the roster grow, and doesn't really feel all that grindy unless you are in a huge rush to unlock every one. If there is a character you really want, look up the charts that show you who unlocks who in Classic mode and you can have the character you want within 30 minutes easy.\\n4) Slow-mo on knockout hits, extra damage in 1v1, the overlaid out of bounds box when someone went flying, and the smoke trailing characters matching their color are all huge quality of life improvements.\\n5) Everything? I could go on and on. I love this game. Within a night of playing it was without a doubt my favorite game of the series.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Arguably, sometimes when it comes to gems for the Nintendo Switch, I sometimes head backwards & give them a chance rather than playing them at the moment. Arguably, I have been more of a light fan of the Super Smash Brothers series than a hard core one. I have played prior Super Smash Brothers games with the arcade fighting fun against the great foes like Master Hand & more updated characters like Ganondorf & Mega Man. Arguably, trying to head back into the franchise is definitely a challenge, but had some things that worked well, where others could've worked better. After finally getting to play Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate, I can finally say this is one of the best multiplayer games to master.\\n\\nSuper Smash Brothers: Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch is one of the best multiplayer experiences you can get, right behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. You have a lengthy amount of content here, where you match & play against as many as 80 characters like Sonic The Hedgehog, Kirby, Luigi, Mario & Wario. This game has a lot of great matches that you can play & stages that celebrate video games' past like Green Hill Zone from Sonic The Hedgehog, the Metroid underworld, where you're battling with Mother Brain in the background. There are many different multiplayer fights with 100 smash battle & custom traditional fighting arcade modes for each character in the arcade mode.\\n\\nBut where the game does shine, but truthfully shines too bright is the World Of Light adventure mode. Where you start as Kirby & he has to travel to unlock multiple fighters as you play the game to try & challenge the dark & light worlds where he can match against classic Smash Brothers foes like Crazy Hand, Giga Bowser & forgotten Nintendo enemies like Mark from the Kirby franchise & Dracula from the Castlevania franchise. The story feels kind of lightweight, where the content is good. I have found the game is fun, but could've been simplified in the end. Sometimes, navigating through the spirit trails can be frustrating & feels more like a exhaustion rather than a strength. But for easier gamers, you can simply tone down the difficulty to make your run though a bit easier. Graphically, the game looks great & has strong music to enjoy, but the control is easy to maintain, but can simply vary during challenges you play within the adventure mode. Still, multiplayer makes the control customizable & easier to maintain.\\n\\nThere are a few disadvantages with the game though. One of them happens to be the Word Of Light. The world looks great, but it doesn't feel as cinematic as prior Super Smash Brothers titles. I actually thought the subspace embessary from Super Smash Brothers: Brawl was a bit more engaging & compelling to play. Another disadvantage is in the level changer where you add fog, swap gravity & add partner foes to help win matches is honestly tedious & can change the matches drastically. When I found out that the stage made a flip upside down to the point that I had to perform the fight in a mirror style by making my controller go left, so I could make the fighter head right to where I could win a match. Arguably, it was very exhausting & caused me to feel drained in the end.\\n\\nWhether you have played Super Smash Brothers in the past, or other fighting games like Street Fighter V, there is a lot to play & have fun with while playing Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate. It is a great game, but more of a circus for excitement with matches with friends & contests. The single player adventure mode is a challenge that does work, but can quite easily drive you down rather than lift you up overall. Still, it is a step up from the failure of the Smash Brothers game on Wii U. So get yourself revved up out of your corner & fight.\\n\\nGraphics: B+\\n\\nSound: B 1/2+\\n\\nControl: B\\n\\nFun & Enjoyment: B- for solo play; B+ for multiplayer\\n\\nOverall: B 1/2+\",\n",

            "        \"9\": \"Let me begin by saying Super Smash Bros. has always been a fighting game franchise I've held dear since my childhood. Each new entry seemed to completely raise the bar, thereby raising my expectations for what kind of surprises were in store for us. And as far as the character reveals go, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate boasted a good amount of surprises for the fans. Lots of heavily requested fighters such as King K. Rool, Ridley and Simon Belmont finally graced the roster. However, I just don't see how they can call this the \\\"Ultimate\\\" version of Smash when so much was taken out in exchange for a larger than normal stage and fighter number. So this brings me to the ultimate question (sorry for the overuse of the word \\\"ultimate\\\" btw). Was what we gained better than what we lost? That's a difficult question for me to answer. Instead, I'll just spill my thoughts. Let's continue with the review.\\n\\nPart 1: Presentation. The formula of Super Smash Bros has remained relatively the same since its debut in 1999. Its control scheme is pretty unique for a fighting game. But, it works excellently. There are no 15-button combos, but a series of standard, special, and aerial attacks that can be used in whichever sequence you see fit. The objective of the game is to rack up damage on your opponents by beating them to a pulp using your wide variety of moves, items, assists etc. and then launching them off the stage. I simply adore the chaotic gameplay of Smash bros. and so do millions of people, hence the large fanbase. However, there are some people in this world who have never played a Smash game before (shocking, right?). I just feel the game could do a better job in presenting itself to newcomers. The \\\"how to play\\\" video doesn't show up until after the game's opening. How will people know to wait after the logo comes on the screen? Other than that, the menu is very clean and straightforward this time around. It only takes 3 button presses to get into a match with you and your buds. I also want to take this time and applaud the beautiful design of the menus. There is a nice mix between simplistic graphics and in-game images. It honestly deserves an award. Not only that, its easier than ever to add up to 8 players to a match, set up custom match rules and edit controller configurations. So much care went into making the experience pleasurable.\\n\\nPart 2: Gameplay. Like I mentioned above, the gameplay of Smash Bros. remained the same. But, this time around, the overall speed has been upped a bit, making the gameplay a tad faster than Smash 4, but a tad slower than Melee. And I gotta say, it really feels great. Since the speed of the game changed, so did some of the animations of the fighters. Taunts, for instance, are quicker and don't leave you vulnerable for as long. And when you launch a fighter, they propel a lot faster and a lot farther. This makes it a bit harder to execute combos, sadly. Despite the faster gameplay, I am AMAZED at how fluid the movements of the fighters still are, as well as how nicely animated some of their new moves are. This game runs at a buttery-smooth 60 fps, despite all the chaos happening on the screen. I'd give this game an A+ in this department. It's not hard to understand why the gameplay of Smash hasn't changed. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\n\\nPart 3: Content. This is where things get dicey. One could argue that having 70+ characters and 100+ stage options qualifies as a hefty amount of content. However,a lot-and I mean ALOT of the features/modes from the prior smash bros. games have been cut. I'm going to start by telling you what you get with this game. There is your standard \\\"Smash\\\" mode, which houses local multiplayer matches. Standard Smash is for 2-8 players. If you have an even larger group of people wanting to play, you'll be glad to know there's a tournament mode. A new multiplayer mode called \\\"squad strike\\\" makes its debut in this game. In this mode, you can challenge a buddy and both of you use a \\\"squad\\\" of 3 or 5 characters to participate in elimination-style matches. Other than that, you can also mess around with the rules in the multiplayer matches. The mode \\\"special\\\" smash makes a return. Playing this mode, will allow you to fight with a variety of battle parameters (make your fighter faint after taking a certain amount of damage, make your fighters large, make them metallic, etc). Next, we have \\\"Spirits mode\\\", which houses this game's campaign mode, \\\"World of Light\\\". This could take a while to wrap up, so i'll try to be brief. Those of you who are familiar with Smash Bros may remember collecting \\\"trophies\\\" which are in-game collectible 3D models of characters who are both in and not in the game. In prior games, there were tons of ways you could unlock trophies, which added hours upon hours of more content. In this game, trophies are gone, but their spirits are carried through...well, spirits. The whole gimmick of \\\"Spirits mode\\\" is fighting,collecting and leveling up spirits, which are obtained by completing matches with a plethora of wacky parameters. So, what are spirits? They're basically the souls of characters who appeared in various games. In this game, they're represented by flat 2D images, rather than 3D models like the trophies were. When you \\\"equip\\\" a spirit, you attain its powers, which in some way, are related to the spirit itself. In super smash bros. brawl for wii, you may remember \\\"stickers\\\", which are almost the exact same thing, but you can't level them up. The whole mechanic of \\\"spirits\\\" is fully brought into play in the \\\"World of Light\\\" campaign mode. This time around, a new foe named \\\"Galeem\\\" has reared his ugly head and claimed the bodies of all the fighters (except Kirby) and is making clones of them. To make these clones fight, he uses the spirits he claimed from non-important characters and embeds them into the clones so that they become animate. Your job is to rescue all of your fallen comrades and restore light to the world. In this mode, you traverse a large, and I mean LARGE map, taking on the clones (with spirits inside them) in a variety of silly matches. Should you beat the clone at their own game, you free the spirit within and you can use their powers to help you free more spirits. Spirits are leveled up naturally by fighting. The better you do in a fight, the more EXP your spirit gets. Playing a good match can also net you \\\"skill points\\\" which can be used to unlock extra stats on top of the ones you get with spirits. When you travel across the map, you will run into your comrades being held captive. If you defeat them in a regular match, you will free them and that means you not only get to use then in World of Light, but in every other mode in the game as well. Each section of World of Light's map has a boss. Defeat that boss and you're one step closer to confronting Galeem. Anyway, you keep going through the cycle of fighting,rescuing spirits,rescuing fighters and taking down bosses for the whole campaign mode. I have yet to complete this mode, but it goes on for a while. My gripe with \\\"World of Light\\\" is that it becomes repetitive after a while. These matches with the crazy battle parameters make up about 90% of the campaign and are, in theory, just matches that you can replicate by messing around with the rules in \\\"Smash mode\\\". This honestly feels like event matches with an unnecessary rpg mechanic slapped on it. Also, the difficulty is all over the place. Some matches are fairly easy and in others, you'll get your can kicked to and fro. Anyhoo, let's keep going. Next, we have \\\"Classic Mode\\\", which is no stranger to us Smash fans. In this mode, you select a character, take on a series of matches and fight a boss at the end. However, this classic mode is a bit different than the \\\"classic\\\" modes we're used to. And by \\\"different\\\", I mean worse. First off, classic mode has been shortened by like 5 matches. Second, there is only one bonus game that you play between matches, and its the same for every fighter and every difficulty you choose. It's a little obstacle course where you collect yellow orbs and race to the end before a black hole swallows you. I just don't understand why they couldn't have at least added different layouts for the obstacle course. In prior games, there were \\\"break the targets\\\" bonus stages that had multiple layouts. Lastly, classic mode ends with a boss. **SPOILER ALERT IN 3...2....1...(SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED)There are only 6 bosses in the game. And in a game with over 70 characters, this means you'll be fighting the same ones over and over. And lo and behold, these are the EXACT six bosses you'll fight in the campaign mode.\\n\\n**SPOILERS OVER**Alright, next I want to cover the online mode. I knew from when it was first unveiled, it would be a mess and I was right. There is no longer the \\\"For fun\\\" and \\\"For Glory\\\" options that were in Smash Bros. for Wii U. There is only the Quickplay option in which you set your match preferences and HOPE you and another player have the same idea of a good match. More often than not, you will be forced to play in 4-player matches if you don't want to play 4-player matches and 1-on-1 matches when you don't feel like playing a 1-on-1. Also, there is noticeable lag (Oh boy, what a surprise) when playing online. Apparently, the game does its best to set you up against players close to you, but if one player has bad internet, everyone suffers.\\n\\nPart 4(UPDATED AS OF AUGUST 2019):The Cutting Board. This is where I want to talk about features than many considered to be standard for Smash games, but for some reason, don't show up in Ultimate. My main problem with this game is that I feel Nintendo stripped the extra content and modes that made Smash Bros. a truly enjoyable experience, leaving behind what the game is at its core: a party fighting game. Nintendo seems to be on this trend lately with games like Mario Tennis Aces, ARMS, Star Fox Zero and Mario Kart 8, where modes that offered a great subsidiary to the main gameplay formula (multiplayer modes, mini game modes, battle modes etc) that were present in PAST TITLES are nowhere to be seen. And I absolutely HATE that Smash had to be a part of this trend. And this most disappointing part of this is that the Switch is Nintendo's 2nd HD game console. We should be getting games that absolutely push the boundaries of what past games were restricted to. Other developers are making their sequels bigger and better, but for some reason, Nintendo is holding back content from their games. It just doesn't make sense. It's as if whenever they take 1 step forward, they have to take 2 steps back. Sorry for the small rant, here are the features that Smash Ultimate lacks. First, mini-games like \\\"Break the Targets\\\", \\\"board the platforms\\\" and \\\"Home run contest\\\" are absent. I feel these games would have been PERFECT for an online leader board functionality. Second, Single player modes like \\\"All-star\\\" and \\\"event match\\\" are absent.\\nUPDATE: Stage Builder mode, which was a feature of the last 2 Smash games, was added via an update and it's amazing how much care went into designing the new components and objects you can play around with. This stage builder easily trumps the other two. Not only that, Tournament mode was added. I' ve decided to bump up my rating by one star to accommodate these additions. Thanks for listening to the fans, Mr. Sakurai.\\n\\nLastly, I want to talk about unlocking methods. You start the game with the original 8 characters that you started with in the Nintendo 64 game, yet all of the stages are unlocked. This baffling to me. In prior smash games, you would have to unlock stages and characters by completing certain requirements. Some of which were very unique and creative, making unlocking the character/stage a truly rewarding experience. With Ultimate, all of that is gone. You simply unlock characters by playing multiplayer matches, classic mode matches or via the \\\"World of Light\\\" campaign. If you want to bring back the nostalgic feel of putting effort towards unlocking something, you need to do it with the stages as well.\\n\\nPart 5: The verdict: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a truly great game at its core. Its gameplay has even been tweaked and refined, further enhancing the experience. However, most of what you'll be doing in this game is playing standard matches, whether it be against a CPU or a few buddies. Many of us were looking forward to a fully fleshed-out adventure mode, but its basically a series of event matches-something we've seen before. And all of the great passtimes like home-run batting, trophy collecting,\\\"break the targets\\\" or stage building are nowhere to be seen. And the one mode we do have that was present in past games, \\\"Classic\\\" mode has been watered down. By no means am I saying this is a terrible game. It's just that I was expected what added to the charm of Smash Bros. to be included in this installment. And I'm very well sure the developers know that we sometimes can't get everything we want. I don't feel ripped off, because there is very well $60 worth of content in this game. And with the addition of fan favorite characters like Banjo-Kazooie coming soon, I am very grateful to the dedication of the development team. Thanks for reading and happy gaming.\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"1 - AMBIDEXTROUS. First of all, I want to say thank you Logitech for making this ambidextrous to the point it is optimal for left handed use. Thanks to a physical condition, I can only use mouses left handed. There is very few options for people who can only use mouses left handed for gaming, and times are looking grim due to recent news regarding left handed mices. Thankfully, ambidextrous designs exist, and I can easily say that this is THE BEST mouse for left handed users, even better than my previous mouse. I hope to see ambidextrous designs continue down the line, and also bonus points for allowing brief customization that allows it to be a left-handed mice.\\n\\n2 - PERFORMANCE. Anyways, I've been using this mouse for almost three months now. Its quite clear that I'm more than satisfied with this mouse, and its not just because its ambidextrous. The wireless performance for this mouse has been on point. I've yet to catch mouse lag. Granted, its only been a few months, but it has shown an equivalence of wired mice performance. At first I was skeptical, but not only has this mice proven to me that its as good as wired mices, it has also made wired mices feel like an annoyance to the point where I don't think I could go back to wired mices. Its hard for something to get in the way thanks to how open the mice is, on top of it being pretty damn light. Using this mice is a breeze. So yeah, this mice is on point on wireless performance, and takes advantage of the benefits of wireless mices.\\n\\n3 - BATTERY LIFE. I will flat out say that the battery life is as good as said. One of the obvious flaws of wireless mices is that they need to be charged. Thankfully, depending on lighting settings, it can last for quite a long time, to the point I forget this mice even needs to be charged. With my current setting, it can last over 60 hours. Logitech has done an amazing job minimizing the flaws of wireless in this mouse.\\n\\n4 - DURABILITY. Its only been a few months since I've used this. Although I've yet to get my mouse into a breaking point, I've developed a bad habit of hitting the side of my keyboard with the top end of my mouse. Despite doing it at times I don't even notice even scratches on the mice. So far, its holding although I've only used this for just a few months.\\n\\n5 - FLAWS?. If there is anything I don't really like about this mice, its the awkward setup. More specifically the end of the cable having a claw-like design. It seemed weird at first, but its as basic as it can get.\\n\\n6 - FINAL THOUGHTS. At first I was somewhat afraid due to the mouse size and the price. My hand is 21x11 cm, and so far I found this mice comfortable. As for price, even though it is $150, I was willing to pay premium just for a good mice for left-handed use. It accommodates for me, it was an upgrade for me, and I am more than happy with this mice alone. There were also comments regarding left and right click overlapping, but that was not the case for my mouse, and this was more of an issue for older G Pro Wireless mices. Wasn't an issue for me which I got in October.\\n\\nOverall, I personally LOVE this mice. Amazing wireless performance on top of maximizing the benefits and does its best minimizing the flaws of wireless. The ambidextrous design is phenomenal and a dream as a left-handed user. if I could rate it higher than 5/5, I would. Thank you, Logitech.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I am a die hard Logitech fan when it comes to peripherals, been using a mice, keyboards, and headsets from them for years now. I was a very big fan of the g403 and bought a few wired ones as well one wireless. I broke most of them as I used to rage but was especially a fan of the wireless, Logitech knows how to do wireless. I always kept the weight in the mouse so I am more used to heavier mice. Because of this I was somewhat nervous to try a lighter mouse, I wanted to try the superlight but I read reviews of more problems with that one, and with the price tag and larger jump in weight difference I thought the regular G pro wireless was the right choice. When I first got it took a bit of getting used to because I would put more effort into my flicks because I was used to more weight, but it didn't take long.\\n\\nThe build quality is very good as always with Logitech in my experience, I have had no issues with ghosting, double clicks etc. The ergonomics are similar to the g403 but different on the sides. The stock sliders are pretty good and I don't think I personally need to change them, although I am not that picky when it comes to that. The scroll wheel has a bit more feedback than the g403 which is good because that mouse had almost none. The mouse buttons are more clicky, lighter and feel more responsive than the g403. The side buttons are smaller but also more clicky, but also stick out more than those on the g403 which makes it easier to engage. The logo is a customizable LED which you can change or turn in the G Hub (great app btw), the scroll wheel no longer is. The sensor is much more precise than the prodigy sensor that I am used to, which was still good, but not close to this one. It also has a larger DPI range than before, which I don't use but its cool I guess. It does not have a DPI switch button on the top anymore, but has one on the bottom, which again I do not use as I have always had it disabled, but is nice to have if I need it. You can also charge this mouse wirelessly via mousepad or some other setup, and can add a weight if you desire to do so. I was very surprised at the battery life on this thing. It was good on my previous wireless mouse but this thing only needs to be charged every week at the most for me. When you turn it on out of rest mode it has LED dots that tell you generally how charged the battery is, but you can also check the G Hub app or it will tell you when it is getting low as a little pop up at the bottom right of your screen. It came with a charging cable that was unbraided so I just used my old g403 braided charging cable as it still fits the micro-usb port. It will not come out when charging and playing and will not change the responsiveness which is really good for wireless. I keep mine on my bungie for quick access and so that I don't notice the wire when using the mouse. This mouse is also ambidextrous so leftys can also use it by swapping out the buttons on the side as it comes setup for right handed users.\\n\\nLogitech is really ahead of the game and has sort of set themselves apart from the competition in the recent years when it comes to wireless gaming, there is not any lag or delay and it is just as responsive as a wired mouse. Wireless is the future and I'm all for it. This is by no means the cheapest mouse, I got it on a deal and still spent a good amount. But it is great for the money, and definitely a competitive gaming mouse that will give you an edge. I think it's great and Logitech has never let me down, so if you're interested in it, and are willing to spend the money on it I say you should go for it and you won't be let down.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I have been using this mouse for almost two weeks and am very glad I made the purchase. My previous mouse was the Logitec G502 Hero, which is also a phenomenal mouse. The G502 Hero is a much cheaper alternative, but it is wired. The G502 Lightspeed has the same great sensor, but it has a few more buttons and is just a little heavier.\\n\\nThat being said, there was a small break-in period for me while using the mouse. For the first few days, it felt too uncontrollable. You'd be surprised how much of an impact a wire will cause on your mouse's feel. The drag of the wire being gone was alone a big thing to get used to. This mouse is also lighter which added to the feeling. After a week of daily usage, it feels MUCH better, even better than my last mouse.\\n\\nThis mouse also has fewer buttons than the G502, but sometimes less is more! It has the primary buttons you need for FPS games.\\n\\nPROS:\\n- Easy setup. Just install Logitech G Hub for customization.\\n- Great battery life with very quick charging.\\n- Great for large hands using claw grip.\\n\\nCONS:\\n- Price\\n- Fewer buttons than G502 but you won't miss them after the break-in period\\n- Small break-in period if moving from heavier mice.\\n\\nOverall solid mouse. 10/10 overall, but only getting a 4 star in the Ergonomic category since the stock pads are not as good as aftermarket alternatives, but they are still very usable.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"*UPDATE* I received my new mouse and have had zero issues for a while now. Incredible mouse. I have to say I'm incredibly satisfied this thing goes as long as it does without requiring a charge up. If you can avoid the defects, this mouse can only be improved upon by an ergonomic choice by the players.\\n\\nThat is to say, if you want something more from this mouse, it would be your subjective taste in how a mouse feels in your hands that would affect your selection. Hand size, grip style, and posture will be the biggest determinant. If you like ambidextrous ergonomics or palm grip, this is about as sublime as it gets for snappy flicks. Very stable tracking for continuous movement of the mouse as you maneuver around an angle. Great responsiveness, but I do feel that \\\"break-in\\\" time with this mouse is longer than most that I owned. I can pick up most mouses and after a few days of DM be completely comfortable with a mouse. This one took weeks, but it rewards you with a really good sensation.\\n\\nIt's how I imagine it feels when a runner finds the right running shoe. Maybe a better comparison is upgrading to a better headset. You can \\\"tell\\\" this one is different and somehow better, it just doesn't feel comfortable in the same way a new leather shoe is a little stiff when you're breaking them in. If you can afford to try this mouse, get it.\\n\\n----Old Review----\\n\\nI honestly wished I was 1 of the 65% of people who purchase these mice and had zero issues with it. The first three days of using this mouse were sublime. I'm a competitive Counter-Strike player. Which means I'm very opinionated about my computer accessories. I have the 240 Hz Monitor, the loud clacky mechanical keyboard, and mousepad that covers half my table. I also happen to have roughly ten different e-sports mice. For me, I tend to go through them rather quickly. I buy them to see if the newer ones have better sensors and to experience the \\\"hand feel\\\" of the mouse. If they don't make me happy, it tends to sit in my drawer for the occasional LAN party when the console plebs want to experience the beautiful game.\\n\\nThe problem with this mouse is very minute but like any papercut. Papercuts tend to chip away at your sanity until you explode in a fit of rage at this minor inconvenience. This mouse double clicks. That is LITERALLY the only issue with it.\\n\\nNow, I understand this sounds a little crazy. However, you need to realize that this is a review created from a series of hilarious coincidences that have convinced me that my mouse is cursed. I don't care if a regular mouse double-clicked. I am quite certain if this mouse was in my office at work. I wouldn't care. Yeah, it pauses the video right when you click to play them. It mysteriously resizes windows when you're trying to move them. Those are minor inconveniences.\\n\\nHowever, I have never been so thoroughly trolled by a mouse in my life when it comes to Counter-Strike. It has rendered me absolutely useless with grenades. Counter-Strike has these things called executes. Which usually requires the entire team of players to synchronize grenade throws to surprise the other side with our cool use of grenades. I am often accused of purposely losing rounds because of this mouse. I cannot seem to hold a grenade in my avatar's hand before I immediately throw it at where ever I happen to look. Which in some cases are the backs of my teammates or an entrance we have to run through.\\n\\nSo what are the benefits? I'm far more accurate with this mouse. This mouse is incredibly precise. You can repeat the same motion of flicking the mouse a certain distance, and you will always turn at that radius. It gives a very snappy response, and there's no strange \\\"glide\\\" feeling like a razer mouse. It should be like this for an esports mouse, especially for shooters. However, the fact this is a wireless mouse, and I can't emphasize this enough, the fact I can't tell the difference from this mouse and Zowie mice is remarkable.\\n\\nI have avoided wireless mice for a long time due to issues with lag and inconsistency in my mechanics while using one. The higher the refresh rate of your monitor, delay in wireless mice is magnified. So consistency is essential for me. I never once thought, the reason I lost an aim duel was due to this mouse. It never failed to do its job. It felt natural. Remember I have ten mice I could switch back at any moment. I didn't even want to consider going back. That's how good it felt to use this thing.\\n\\nI'm going to take my chances with replacing the current mouse and pray I don't have another one with this issue. If I don't have any further issues, I will update this review.\",\n",

            "        \"6\": \"So lets get this out of the way, why not 5 stars. The only reason I'm not giving this mouse 5 stars is because the profile/settings are not stored on the hardware itself. Logitech software must be running for RGB profile as well as resolution setting. The mouse has a default RGB setting and DPI. This is my first wireless mouse, so maybe that is the reason? My previous wired mice Razer and Corsair brand seemed to keep their profile.\\n\\nCharging:\\n\\nI don't have the charging mat to go with this mouse, but I don't find it a hassle to charge. Pretty convenient using the cable they provide which the USB dongle can attach to. I try to swap them out once a week just to make sure it always has a charge.\\n\\nHand-feel:\\n\\nI have fairly large hands (6'2\\\" is my height), the size was a little concerning for me as I've always purchased large mice. I like it though, it weighs next to nothing, especially compared to the last few mice I've used. The only other minor gripe I have with this mouse is that I tend to have my pinky on the ground when I play. There are times when I flick right (I'm right handed) and the fat on my pinky goes under the mouse bringing up the right edge of the mouse off the table. The mouse basically must have full contact to operate and I have noticed at times, not just flicking, but panic tracking, that the mouse is non-responsive because it is just a few MMs off the table. I've been trying to adjust how I hold the mouse which always alleviates the issue, and I could probably benefit from better mouse-posture anyway, so I can't really consider this in my star-rating.\\n\\nSoftware:\\n\\nIMO Razer has the absolute best software for my needs. The Logitech software seems good, I'll need more time and play more variety of games to really see if it checks all the boxes for me though. I've been fairly casual since I got this mouse, Ark Survival Evolved, Rust, Icarus, Among Us, pretty much all things that only require default functionality, no MMO play yet.\\n\\nRandom thoughts:\\n\\nWhat happened to the day when we'd add weights to our mice? I think part of it is the popularity of quick-action shooters such as Valorant. You can't flick with a boulder. I purchased this mouse because I really like the game Rust, a popular Rust streamer, spoonkid, plugged this mouse during one of his streams and I wanted to check it out. I tell you what, I went from a rock on the beach to AK in half the time with this mouse. j/k I still suck at Rust, but that's on me.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Let me start off by saying that this mouse is absolutely FANTASTIC! I have been using it for nearly a week now and have already fallen in love. Before this mouse, I used a Hyperx pulsefire haste, which is around 60 grams and is pretty good, but It started acting up only after a year of ownership. This mouse weights about 20 grams more but doesn't feel like it, the weight is balanced so well that it feels like an ultra-lightweight mouse, and the battery life is incredible especially if you turn off the RGB (you can do this in the Logitech G Hub software). I'm predicting around 7-10 days of use, using it around 8 hours a day. The build quality is pretty good and the mouse is extremely comfortable, the scroll wheel is tactile while also not feeling \\\"crunchy\\\" and the buttons all feel top tier. The tracking is also exceptional and I have not experienced any issues with the sensor. There are 5 DPI settings by default, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and 6400 which can be swapped by using the button on the bottom of the mouse. You can make your own profile in the Logitech G Hbu software and set your DPI anywhere between 100 and 25600. You can also change the polling rate in this software, the 4 options are 1000, 500, 250, and 125 hz. I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone who is in the market for an extremely comfortable, well-balanced, and reliable mouse.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"Logitech has done an outstanding job manufacturing a wireless competitive gaming mouse. I personally will never be sold on the idea of a wireless mouse being better than a wired one just because of signal interference alone, this does not detract from the fact that this mouse is indeed a dam good mouse even for fast pace FPS shooters. I will try to go in order writing my review of this mouse from opening to playing with it.\\n\\n*Packaging*\\n\\nFor a $150 mouse I expected more from the packaging however I do understand that maybe Logitech wanted to keep things simple. There is no wow factor here just a simple small box wrapped in plastic. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn't be able to tell this thing costs$150.\\n\\n*Opening*\\n\\nSo once I got into the box that looks as though the contents of it didn't cost $150, I was once again taken aback. Reason being that the mouse was just sitting there unwrapped. The reason this kinda surprised me was because I had to make sure that I didn't accidentally order a used mouse. Nothing against used electronics but I generally stay away from them because they could potentially have unseen underlying issues, however Amazon and their generous return policy has restored some of my confidence in buying them but I did not want to go that route with this mouse at this price point. The mouse did have tape on the underside once I lifted it from its cradle but again I did double check to make sure that it wasn't a used product. I removed the tape from the underside and checked the mouse skates for any signs of scratches and everything was cool.\\n\\n*Package Contents*\\n\\nThe package contained what you'd expect. The mouse, a wireless dongle, and a cord all wrapped and in good condition. One thing that concerned me that I wasn't sure about was whether or not the buttons on the right side of the mouse were preinstalled and to my relief they weren't. The reason I say this is because I prefer not to disassemble my electronics if I don't have to, if you have to then you gotta do what you gotta do but I work in maintenance and repeatedly taking something apart and putting it back together causes excessive wear and damage and I'd prefer keeping my $150 mouse in pristine condition other than normal wear and tear.\\n\\n*The Mouse*\\n\\nThe mouse itself felt great, it felt solid and sound. The shell was sturdy I'm a heavy handed individual and I was comfortable applying normal pressures from my hands to the mouse with fear or it being damaged or broken. The mouse slides gracefully across the mouse pad out of the box so you won't encounter issues there, I would've preferred they used the mouse skates Razer has been using on their largest mice but it is what it is I ordered some Hyperglides to replace them.\\n\\n*Installation*\\n\\nSo the mouse is plug & play, I already had G Hub installed and the software recognized the hardware no problem. I didn't have to update any firmware or anything so that was cool I just plugged the dongle into the computer and turned the mouse on from the bottom and it was good to go.\\n\\n*The feels*\\n\\nSo I have large hands and going into this I expected it to be small for my hands and I was correct. I use somewhat of a palm claw hybrid and I found that I had some empty space between my hand and the mouse itself which is kinda like a dead zone and could cause slop when making fast movements. Like I said I anticipated this going in so I can't say I'm disappointed. The side buttons are nice as well as far as where they are positioned and how they feel when you press them, they're very responsive. My only gripe would really be to move them back a little but I attribute that to the size of the mouse itself if the mouse was a little larger they'd naturally be further back. The button position in relation to the size of the mouse is fine and about where you'd expect them to be. The two main mouse buttons feel pretty good as well the clicks sound good and feel equally as good I had no double click issues or indications thereof. One thing to really look out for are people buying this product used from someone else who had the double click issue and sending it back then someone else buys the mouse again with the same problem and all of a sudden a lot of people end up sharing the same mouse with the same issue leaving the same review complaining about the same problem. I've encountered no double click issue so far. The weight of the mouse itself is great as well it feels really balanced not too light but not too heavy.\\n\\n*Tracking*\\n\\nSo this is where the rubber meets the road, I wanted to test just how good this mouse is and if it's as good as they say it is. I tried this thing out not in Microsoft word or nothing like that I went straight to Apex Legends and COD. I went into G Hub to check my configurations and much to my surprise I didn't have to do anything another good thing about G Hub is that your settings apply universally to all Logitech mice so because I had profiles set up for one mouse they assumed it'd be the same for this one so that was a good surprise. The mouse tracked very well I have to admit I was impressed for a wireless mouse that didn't fit my hands that well I performed amicably and even was champion a few games and I'm not one to argue with results. The mouse tracked even my most minute movements without skipping a beat.\\n\\n*Conclusion*\\n\\nI was on the fence about even picking up a wireless mouse because I wasn't sure if the technology was really ready for competitive gaming but it has come a long way. My only real issue with wireless is the batteries, no matter how good the battery may be eventually it will wear out and turn your wireless mouse back into a wired one Logitech could circumvent this by making the battery removable but they'd sell less mice in doing so. Which leads me to the reason I chose Logitech over Razer because I've had to trash a wireless mouse once already in the past granted the technology back then isn't what it was today. I'll hold on to the mouse because I like it and it performs it will be the one in the arsenal. I've attached some photos of the mouse alongside some more other popular mice in the game for size comparison. Enjoy.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"So I have small hands, and I came from the wired Razer Viper Mini because I wanted to go wireless to get rid of the cable drag sensation. The G Pro compared to the Viper Mini is heavier and bigger, so it was hard to handle initially, but I eventually got used to it. If you have bigger hands or are used to using bigger mice, this will be great for you - you won't have to go through an adjustment period. I think for my next upgrade I'll go for the G Pro X Superlight. I'm a lower sens FPS player so the lighter the better, but I'd still recommend the G Pro for competitive FPS gaming if you want a higher end gaming mouse, but don't wanna break the bank too much.\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"***Update: I had originally given these 3 stars per below, but after more time I've updated it to 5... The battery life and wireless range is phenomenal, both are so much better than my previous Corsairs! I was charging those daily, after only about 4-5 hours I'd get low battery warnings, but I almost never have to charge these, it's insane how long they last... and the range is almost twice what I got from the Corsairs, I can roam all over and never lose sound! So just be sure to tweak the sound a bit as I noted before, and maybe about $15 of the price is simply for the brand name, but I'm liking these more and more with time!\\n\\nInitial Review:\\n\\nOk, I'm really torn on these... First things first: myself, along with many others, think the sound quality is horrible out of the box! People that say they sound great I don't think have experience with more expensive headphones and are probably moving up from $30 cheapos...\\n\\nFirst thing: After scouring Reddit and some trial and error, turn off all the special sound settings (like DTS and advanced settings) and move the bass to +7 and the treble to +4. After I made this change, the quality was much much better!\\n\\nI previously had Corsair HS70s for two years and HS80s for two years, but I hate the iCue software Corsair uses, it's a ridiculous resource hog and constantly has issues. So for me this is actually a mild downgrade price-wise as you read my pros and cons, they're primarily vs my Corsairs:\\n\\nPros: Incredibly lightweight and very comfortable. Battery lasts absolutely forever (I had to charge my Corsairs daily; the Logitech can go for days!). Sound is adequate once tweaked. Volume tops off at a low level but as a 45-year-old who is a huge music fan I can tell my ears aren't what they once were, so they're doing this for your protection. Software is \\\"light-weight\\\" and unobtrusive.\\n\\nCons: If you're mainly listening to music, spend a bit more on Corsair or Steelseries or even a purely audiophile set. You'll be disappointed with these. They're lightweight but as a downer feel a bit flimsy. As I said, sound is terrible out of the box imo.\\n\\nI really struggled with the number of stars to give! For the money, if you know you're getting a lightweight pair of headphones with great battery and no hassle, they're not bad at all. If you want more quality to your sound, go elsewhere however. A little bit more money can get you a way better sound.\\n\\nAs for Logitech in general, I was tired of having three different programs (keyboard, mouse, headphones) so also got a Logitech mouse after remembering one I loved years back. The brand does feel overpriced for the quality they provide, as a general rule, as if they're capitalizing off their brand. I'm ok with both these and the mouse, they're fine, but for just $20-40 more each I'd say try one of the newer brands if you haven't before. The Logitech stuff just feels cheaper overall than the price would suggest but they get the job done!\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I wanted something with a little range so I could putter about my home without the crackle and pop of a faltering signal. I've been burned before on a pair of Logitech G533's that absolutely would not hold a charge nor connect wirelessly, so figured I'd take a chance on a different model.\\n\\nI've not had them for long at all, in fact I've only had them for the one day, and will update my review if needed, but I immediately charged them and put them through a 10-hour run and so far I'm impressed. These were plug and play, worked and connected instantly, and I can listen to PC audio through these anywhere in my home. Granted it's a smaller place, so not much of an ask, but I'm just so glad I can listen to whatever or voice chat using the optional mic (though at my desk I use a Blue Yeti mic) while putting food together or slapping art materials together in another room.\\n\\nThese look great with the white/aluminum corsair mechanical LED keyboard I recently acquired as well. Love that clean-and-colorful look! Will probably match all my peripherals to it whenever they need replacing.\\n\\nThese are not strictly noise canceling but they actually do a good job of muffling the background noise anyway, which helps in concentrating on what I'm listening to. Not bad for something that doesn't clamp onto your skull with a vice grip! Pretty lightweight and comfortable so far, and the audio quality is pretty solid. Not astounding, but not poor by any means. Good for both voice chat and gaming, and not bad for music. For what its worth I'm probably not the best judge of that as I'm lacking a bit in sensitivity to lower tones/voices in one ear, so my hearing is always just a smidge off no matter what I listen through. Your mileage may vary.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I love these headphones. They were easy to setup with my PC. I LOVE that they are wireless. I hate having cords all over my gaming setup so being able to charge the headphones and rock them for about a week without needing to charge them is great. My previously Logitech headphones weren\\u2019t wireless and the cord would always get trapped under my chair. Now I don\\u2019t have to worry about it. The headphones also feel great. I wear glasses and sometimes headsets don\\u2019t fit comfortably with my glasses and the glasses arms would press against the back of my ears and hurt them, but I\\u2019ve worn these headphones for 8 hours straight and haven\\u2019t had any issues. They\\u2019re also really good and canceling our noise. My boyfriend and I play video games in the same room and when I wear my headphones it\\u2019s difficult to hear him talking in the room when he is several feet away from me. The headphones do a good job So far they\\u2019re definitely worth the price. Plus they look so cute with the lights on the sides.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"It's honestly unbelievable to me that I'm having such a hard time finding a headset with sound as good as my cheap 6-year-old $15 Sades headset that recently needed replacing, let alone better. It was uncomfortable, so I wouldn't buy another from that brand, but the sound was, I am realizing in retrospect as I try out more expensive headsets, unexpectedly great.\\n\\nAnyway, let's talk about this headset. I kind of love it. I wish I loved it more. It's good; it's just not perfect.\\n\\nCOMFORT: I'm a woman with a fairly average-sized head (hat size 7 1/8), and it's hard to find headsets that weren't only designed with large men's heads in mind. The elastic strap across the top of these makes the headset lighter and more comfortable to wear, and I really like it. The strap has two notches on each side, so you can adjust a bit for the size of your head. The strap being separate from the solid headband also helps you remove, adjust, or hang up the headset without directly touching your head or the strap, which is nice. The earcups are plush and cloth-covered, which is comfortable and doesn't get as hot as pleather cups normally do, and doesn't squeeze your head as much as those do while wearing glasses.\\n\\nHowever, the headset is still somewhat bulky, especially the large earcups, and while these are quite comfortable overall, it would have been even better for me if they were a little smaller and lighter. If you have a larger head, this will likely not be an issue for you.\\n\\nLOOKS/BUILD: These look nice (I got the white version), less boring and bulky than most gaming headsets on the market. The design is sleek and stylish, and the headset seems sturdy and well-made.\\n\\nHEADPHONE SOUND: It's ok. It's nothing amazing, and I would want to use something better for listening to music for fun, but it's not bad. The directional audio works ok for games.\\n\\nSOFTWARE: The Logitech G software is pretty good. It shows the battery percentage of the headset and allows you to adjust the lighting and various sound settings. But more on that when I get to the mic.\\n\\nLIGHTS: The RGB strips are a nice feature and they look good, but it seemed like I was hearing a slight buzz in the right ear when the lights were on, so I keep them turned off. Interestingly, if you go out of wireless range, the lights will go back on, so it works as an indicator for me.\\n\\nWIRELESS: The quality of the wireless is the biggest reason I love this headset. It works well and has a large, reliable range: I can walk most of the way across my apartment before it cuts out, which is important because I often have to chase after a naughty cat while in the middle of something, and I can keep up a conversation while I do.\\n\\n\\\"DISCORD INTEGRATION\\\": I still don't know what this is supposed to mean, but Discord does recognize the headset well, and I've never had it randomly disconnect inputs or have any other problems like I've had with other headsets. This headset has been very solid for me in that sense: you plug in the dongle and it just works.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: The battery life is very good. You can also still use the headset while it's charging, and it charges fast. The cable is just a normal USB-C to USB-A cable, so you can plug it in anywhere convenient. I'm regularly in calls all day without needing to charge the headset, so I normally plug it in overnight every day or two.\\n\\nMIC: Here's the problem, and the reason I'm rating this four stars. The mic isn't good. It's just not. It's functional, and if you're using this is in some way in which you'll never have to hear your own voice-- gaming, video calls-- it's good enough. But it's not good enough for streaming or recording. The Logitech software allows you to adjust all sorts of settings and even download settings other people put together, and it helps, but it doesn't make the mic good. I was hoping this could be all I'd need for now as my current setup is too noisy for a standalone mic, but I might have to look into getting a ModMic to stream with this. The mic itself doesn't flip up, but it's bendable and detachable, so you can remove it if you want to use a different mic.\\n\\nOVERALL: I wish the mic were better, and it would be great if the headphone sound were a bit more impressive too, but for the price, it's a very good headset overall for general use. If you need more professional sound, this is not that. There are no serious problems that I've encountered with the headset, though-- it's solid and reliable; it's just that the worst aspects of it are only ok and not great.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Let me start with the negative:\\n\\nThe only adjustment to the headband is to switch how it is attached to the headphones. Headband is elastic, so will likely stretch over time. Also, Logitech does not sell the earpads. Just the headstraps. I bought the white version, so I could swap out the straps and earpads to change colors. Wish Logitech made other colors for the other earpads and sold the earpads, because it would be cool to personalize them even more. Would sure love some teal earpads. Also, on the PS4, I have to adjust the mic every time I plug in the device. On the computer, the mic was set so low by default, it was difficult to hear the voice. Had to go into the Windows settings to adjust, using the old control panel option. PITA. Once turned up, it sounds fantastic. Finally, we cannot figure out how to turn off the lights when on the PS4. Using the app on Windows will let you do so when you are using the headset.\\n\\nSo why am I giving the headphones 5 stars with those negatives?\\n\\nThe incoming audio is fantastic. We are audiophiles here. Very good sound quality in the Logitech G733 headsets. My husband, a musician, loves the sound quality. He is very picky. Even bought his own pair of G733s, after trying mine. He is using it for work too.\\n\\nThe mic is also outstanding. Crisp, clear audio from both my female alto voice and his baritone gruff voice. He has used mine on MS Team meetings (windows 10) for work, and when we play cooperatively on PS4 video games, on PS Plus, using different PS4s.\\n\\nEven though the headset was a tad tight at first, and there are limited settings, both of us love the comfort. I prefer the other earpads to the Logitech ones. They are softer. But the Logitech ones feel like memory foam. Will likely last longer than the cheap purple ones I bought.\\n\\nI also bought the wireless Hyper X Cloud II headset, before buying these. The G733s were second on my list. The sound quality of the Cloud II is equal to the Logitech G733. The mic quality is not as clear in the Cloud II. The comfort in the Cloud II is just a smidgen better. It has more adjustments too.\\n\\nCannot rate them on PC gaming latency though. I do not play PC games. There is a little delay on the PS4 online gaming, however, one cannot necessarily blame the headset. Sony is not known to have the fastest servers.\\n\\nHope this helps you make an educated decision. I love these, from a style, fit, comfort and audio/mic quality perspective.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"For the price these are probably one of the most solid products I've ever purchased. I'm the kind of guy who never says/thinks that kind of thing (I'm very picky when it comes to spending money) or even writes reviews, so take that into consideration when reading this. I bought these in Oct. '21 and they've MORE than lasted since then. I have replaced the bungee head strap, but I'm a freakishly tall guy with a commensurately big head so I'm not surprised I stretched it out. That's probably the only piece that I'll need to replace regularly ($15 every 6 months, I can live with that). The cups just got a little gunky after a few months and were also replaced but after cleaning the originals I now have a set of two that can be swapped out any time. The rest of the build quality is excellent. I remove the mic \\\"stump\\\" multiple times every day (usually if I'm eating or something) and it's never given me any issues at all. This piece can also be swapped out, but are a bit more expensive than the other items. I guess you could probably just plug any old 3.5mm jacked mic into the headset and just use it that way, I can't imagine you'd lose any features but you may.\\n\\nThe sound quality is really not bad at all. Not amazing or outside of the expectation of a product like this, but it's quite good. I do find myself often using these instead of other options when walking around the house. They're a bit bulky, but I'm not putting them on for the sake of my image. The noise cancellation is meh to serviceable, I can still easily hear my dog barking out the front window downstairs when all the kids get out of school and are walking by to get home.\\n\\nThe range is decent, I'd say it's about a 50 foot bubble from the transmitter. It goes through drywall decently enough, but not so easily through brick or concrete unless it's very thin. You won't be listening to Never Gonna Give You Up on your way to the mailbox, but a kitchen run is definitely still on the table.\\n\\nThe software that comes with (Logitech G Hub) can be a little buggy, but your mileage may vary. My computer is an ancient relic from a bygone era, so if you're using hardware newer than 2015 you'll probably have a better time. It does allow lots of cool features and total control over the EQ for both sound and your voice, and I REALLY enjoy the built-in side tone feature, (which is when you can hear your own voice in exact real time through the headset as you speak, thus making it easier to speak naturally and not too loudly or even be purposefully quieter than you normally would) as the ear cups do muffle your own voice to a fair degree.\\n\\nThe sound quality of the mic is... not amazing, but it's still leagues better than anything that anyone I work with uses. Our company issues these little garbage headsets that make it sound like you're talking through a drive-thru speaker, so almost anything would have been an upgrade. Like I mentioned before, you can tweak the voice EQ in the settings but it's still limited. You're not going to get full blown desk mic performance out of this, but besides sounding a tad compressed it's still really not that bad. I have an awesome desk mic with an arm that I use for recording work stuff, and the headphones still work wonderfully without using the included mic attachment.\\n\\nThis gets it's own section: The noise cancellation on the mic. It's actually pretty sweet. I have to run a window A/C unit in the summer and a space heater in the winter in the room in which I work. They're not very quiet at all, but with this mic you'd almost never know they were on. You do get a bit of that \\\"fade in, fade out\\\" with the background noise when you speak, but this thing isn't some $1000 solution for those kinds of problems, so take it or leave it. It's really not that bad, you probably wouldn't even notice if I hadn't told you.\\n\\nAll-in-all, these are an extraordinary value for what they are. I don't really review stuff, and I'm supposed to be doing something else right now, but I just had the random urge to write this review so here I am. Buy these - you won't regret it.\",\n",

My girlfriend bought me these headphones a while back, and i love them.\\n\\nThe comfort of wearing them is 11/10. These headphones are incredibly comfortable, i can (and sometimes do) wear these nonstop. Sometimes i forget i even have them on. They dont block much sound out, so if your looking for noise cancel/isolation this isnt really the headset for you. i would guess that 60% of the ambient noise can leak into the headset.\\n\\nThe mic is not great, if you are looking for a high quality microphone this isnt it. Its good enough to communicate through voice, people wont have a hard time understanding you, but this is not some high grade microphone. Its pretty standard, a benefit is the microphone piece itself can be removed and maybe even replaced since its just a standard headphone jack that the mic plugs into. So the microphone itself can be removed. Most of the time i have the mic in and it seems very durable. Even if you do break it buying a replacement mic bit is pretty cheap on amazon.\\n\\nThe main reason i give this set 5/5 stars despite the mic not being great is because they are the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn in my life. These are wearable, they are truly comfortable. I cannot stress how comfortable these headphones are, it is 11/10 in that department which carries an otherwise 4/5 star headset into being 5 stars.\",\n",

The G HUB software is needed to take full advantage of all the features.\\n\\nPRO\\u2019s:\\n\\nCOMFORT: This headset is super comfortable and ultra-light (9.8 oz) and is perfect for marathon sessions.\\n\\nSOUND: The sound is excellent, use G HUB to enable Advanced EQ and Surround Sound. The easiest way to adjust the sound using Advanced EQ is to run your game and G HUB, pick a preset filter (for instance; FPS) and adjust the EQ while playing, experiment with the sliders (and other filters) go as deep or high as you want, when your finished you can save the filter to any name you want, don\\u2019t worry about the original you can reset that to default. This headset focuses on spatial sound (with Surround Sound enabled) and does a great job, among the best I heard while gaming.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Excellent 29 hours with RGB off and 20 hours with RGB on.\\n\\nMIC: I\\u2019ve used a few different headsets through the years and this one has the best mic. It\\u2019s not the quality of a high-end broadcaster's mic but it\\u2019s everything you need for gaming, and it does sound pretty darn good with Blue Voice filtering (G HUB) enabled. The mic is easily detached.\\n\\nBUILD: Very Good materials and craftsmanship.\\n\\nWIRELESS RANGE: Approximately 60 Feet\\n\\nRGB Lighting: Front facing on each driver housing, it works well and is controlled using G HUB.\\n\\nNOISE CANCALING: Passive, I find it perfect for me.\\n\\nCON\\u2019s:\\n\\nNothing really, for this price nothing needs to be entered here.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"I got these for gaming, listening to music, and chatting with friends on Discord. Once I had them fully charged and set up, I tested the mic first which sounded great after just some minimal setting tweaking. Next, I started listening to some music while looking at the sound settings and before even tweaking anything yet, they started having a sudden robotic static vibration-like sound. I tried a quite a few things to fix this, but the only thing that actually worked was turning the headset completely off and then back on again. But the static robot sounds kept coming back no matter what I did around the 5-10 minute mark of use each and every time. My volume was only at 50% and I was using default settings for sound, so it couldn't have been anything I did, and tweaking the settings in an attempt to fix the issue just made it sound even worse. I'm assuming this is a manufacturing issue of some sort with this particular pair. Other than that issue, when they did work they were amazing, probably even one of the best sounding pairs I've ever had for under $200... if only they weren't messed up. I'm returning them and going back to a brand I'm more familiar with though, for now.\",\n",

Only gripe with this headset is when it is in RGB mode there's a little buzzish sound that comes from the earcups (I know it sounds crazy but there's a buzz sound only when RGB is active). Due to the gripe, I keep the RGB off so the sound doesn't bother me while I game and watch videos. For the price point, it's solid and would recommend to others that want to swap from wired to wireless like me.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"***Update: I had originally given these 3 stars per below, but after more time I've updated it to 5... The battery life and wireless range is phenomenal, both are so much better than my previous Corsairs! I was charging those daily, after only about 4-5 hours I'd get low battery warnings, but I almost never have to charge these, it's insane how long they last... and the range is almost twice what I got from the Corsairs, I can roam all over and never lose sound! So just be sure to tweak the sound a bit as I noted before, and maybe about $15 of the price is simply for the brand name, but I'm liking these more and more with time!\\n\\nInitial Review:\\n\\nOk, I'm really torn on these... First things first: myself, along with many others, think the sound quality is horrible out of the box! People that say they sound great I don't think have experience with more expensive headphones and are probably moving up from $30 cheapos...\\n\\nFirst thing: After scouring Reddit and some trial and error, turn off all the special sound settings (like DTS and advanced settings) and move the bass to +7 and the treble to +4. After I made this change, the quality was much much better!\\n\\nI previously had Corsair HS70s for two years and HS80s for two years, but I hate the iCue software Corsair uses, it's a ridiculous resource hog and constantly has issues. So for me this is actually a mild downgrade price-wise as you read my pros and cons, they're primarily vs my Corsairs:\\n\\nPros: Incredibly lightweight and very comfortable. Battery lasts absolutely forever (I had to charge my Corsairs daily; the Logitech can go for days!). Sound is adequate once tweaked. Volume tops off at a low level but as a 45-year-old who is a huge music fan I can tell my ears aren't what they once were, so they're doing this for your protection. Software is \\\"light-weight\\\" and unobtrusive.\\n\\nCons: If you're mainly listening to music, spend a bit more on Corsair or Steelseries or even a purely audiophile set. You'll be disappointed with these. They're lightweight but as a downer feel a bit flimsy. As I said, sound is terrible out of the box imo.\\n\\nI really struggled with the number of stars to give! For the money, if you know you're getting a lightweight pair of headphones with great battery and no hassle, they're not bad at all. If you want more quality to your sound, go elsewhere however. A little bit more money can get you a way better sound.\\n\\nAs for Logitech in general, I was tired of having three different programs (keyboard, mouse, headphones) so also got a Logitech mouse after remembering one I loved years back. The brand does feel overpriced for the quality they provide, as a general rule, as if they're capitalizing off their brand. I'm ok with both these and the mouse, they're fine, but for just $20-40 more each I'd say try one of the newer brands if you haven't before. The Logitech stuff just feels cheaper overall than the price would suggest but they get the job done!\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I wanted something with a little range so I could putter about my home without the crackle and pop of a faltering signal. I've been burned before on a pair of Logitech G533's that absolutely would not hold a charge nor connect wirelessly, so figured I'd take a chance on a different model.\\n\\nI've not had them for long at all, in fact I've only had them for the one day, and will update my review if needed, but I immediately charged them and put them through a 10-hour run and so far I'm impressed. These were plug and play, worked and connected instantly, and I can listen to PC audio through these anywhere in my home. Granted it's a smaller place, so not much of an ask, but I'm just so glad I can listen to whatever or voice chat using the optional mic (though at my desk I use a Blue Yeti mic) while putting food together or slapping art materials together in another room.\\n\\nThese look great with the white/aluminum corsair mechanical LED keyboard I recently acquired as well. Love that clean-and-colorful look! Will probably match all my peripherals to it whenever they need replacing.\\n\\nThese are not strictly noise canceling but they actually do a good job of muffling the background noise anyway, which helps in concentrating on what I'm listening to. Not bad for something that doesn't clamp onto your skull with a vice grip! Pretty lightweight and comfortable so far, and the audio quality is pretty solid. Not astounding, but not poor by any means. Good for both voice chat and gaming, and not bad for music. For what its worth I'm probably not the best judge of that as I'm lacking a bit in sensitivity to lower tones/voices in one ear, so my hearing is always just a smidge off no matter what I listen through. Your mileage may vary.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I love these headphones. They were easy to setup with my PC. I LOVE that they are wireless. I hate having cords all over my gaming setup so being able to charge the headphones and rock them for about a week without needing to charge them is great. My previously Logitech headphones weren\\u2019t wireless and the cord would always get trapped under my chair. Now I don\\u2019t have to worry about it. The headphones also feel great. I wear glasses and sometimes headsets don\\u2019t fit comfortably with my glasses and the glasses arms would press against the back of my ears and hurt them, but I\\u2019ve worn these headphones for 8 hours straight and haven\\u2019t had any issues. They\\u2019re also really good and canceling our noise. My boyfriend and I play video games in the same room and when I wear my headphones it\\u2019s difficult to hear him talking in the room when he is several feet away from me. The headphones do a good job So far they\\u2019re definitely worth the price. Plus they look so cute with the lights on the sides.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"It's honestly unbelievable to me that I'm having such a hard time finding a headset with sound as good as my cheap 6-year-old $15 Sades headset that recently needed replacing, let alone better. It was uncomfortable, so I wouldn't buy another from that brand, but the sound was, I am realizing in retrospect as I try out more expensive headsets, unexpectedly great.\\n\\nAnyway, let's talk about this headset. I kind of love it. I wish I loved it more. It's good; it's just not perfect.\\n\\nCOMFORT: I'm a woman with a fairly average-sized head (hat size 7 1/8), and it's hard to find headsets that weren't only designed with large men's heads in mind. The elastic strap across the top of these makes the headset lighter and more comfortable to wear, and I really like it. The strap has two notches on each side, so you can adjust a bit for the size of your head. The strap being separate from the solid headband also helps you remove, adjust, or hang up the headset without directly touching your head or the strap, which is nice. The earcups are plush and cloth-covered, which is comfortable and doesn't get as hot as pleather cups normally do, and doesn't squeeze your head as much as those do while wearing glasses.\\n\\nHowever, the headset is still somewhat bulky, especially the large earcups, and while these are quite comfortable overall, it would have been even better for me if they were a little smaller and lighter. If you have a larger head, this will likely not be an issue for you.\\n\\nLOOKS/BUILD: These look nice (I got the white version), less boring and bulky than most gaming headsets on the market. The design is sleek and stylish, and the headset seems sturdy and well-made.\\n\\nHEADPHONE SOUND: It's ok. It's nothing amazing, and I would want to use something better for listening to music for fun, but it's not bad. The directional audio works ok for games.\\n\\nSOFTWARE: The Logitech G software is pretty good. It shows the battery percentage of the headset and allows you to adjust the lighting and various sound settings. But more on that when I get to the mic.\\n\\nLIGHTS: The RGB strips are a nice feature and they look good, but it seemed like I was hearing a slight buzz in the right ear when the lights were on, so I keep them turned off. Interestingly, if you go out of wireless range, the lights will go back on, so it works as an indicator for me.\\n\\nWIRELESS: The quality of the wireless is the biggest reason I love this headset. It works well and has a large, reliable range: I can walk most of the way across my apartment before it cuts out, which is important because I often have to chase after a naughty cat while in the middle of something, and I can keep up a conversation while I do.\\n\\n\\\"DISCORD INTEGRATION\\\": I still don't know what this is supposed to mean, but Discord does recognize the headset well, and I've never had it randomly disconnect inputs or have any other problems like I've had with other headsets. This headset has been very solid for me in that sense: you plug in the dongle and it just works.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: The battery life is very good. You can also still use the headset while it's charging, and it charges fast. The cable is just a normal USB-C to USB-A cable, so you can plug it in anywhere convenient. I'm regularly in calls all day without needing to charge the headset, so I normally plug it in overnight every day or two.\\n\\nMIC: Here's the problem, and the reason I'm rating this four stars. The mic isn't good. It's just not. It's functional, and if you're using this is in some way in which you'll never have to hear your own voice-- gaming, video calls-- it's good enough. But it's not good enough for streaming or recording. The Logitech software allows you to adjust all sorts of settings and even download settings other people put together, and it helps, but it doesn't make the mic good. I was hoping this could be all I'd need for now as my current setup is too noisy for a standalone mic, but I might have to look into getting a ModMic to stream with this. The mic itself doesn't flip up, but it's bendable and detachable, so you can remove it if you want to use a different mic.\\n\\nOVERALL: I wish the mic were better, and it would be great if the headphone sound were a bit more impressive too, but for the price, it's a very good headset overall for general use. If you need more professional sound, this is not that. There are no serious problems that I've encountered with the headset, though-- it's solid and reliable; it's just that the worst aspects of it are only ok and not great.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Let me start with the negative:\\n\\nThe only adjustment to the headband is to switch how it is attached to the headphones. Headband is elastic, so will likely stretch over time. Also, Logitech does not sell the earpads. Just the headstraps. I bought the white version, so I could swap out the straps and earpads to change colors. Wish Logitech made other colors for the other earpads and sold the earpads, because it would be cool to personalize them even more. Would sure love some teal earpads. Also, on the PS4, I have to adjust the mic every time I plug in the device. On the computer, the mic was set so low by default, it was difficult to hear the voice. Had to go into the Windows settings to adjust, using the old control panel option. PITA. Once turned up, it sounds fantastic. Finally, we cannot figure out how to turn off the lights when on the PS4. Using the app on Windows will let you do so when you are using the headset.\\n\\nSo why am I giving the headphones 5 stars with those negatives?\\n\\nThe incoming audio is fantastic. We are audiophiles here. Very good sound quality in the Logitech G733 headsets. My husband, a musician, loves the sound quality. He is very picky. Even bought his own pair of G733s, after trying mine. He is using it for work too.\\n\\nThe mic is also outstanding. Crisp, clear audio from both my female alto voice and his baritone gruff voice. He has used mine on MS Team meetings (windows 10) for work, and when we play cooperatively on PS4 video games, on PS Plus, using different PS4s.\\n\\nEven though the headset was a tad tight at first, and there are limited settings, both of us love the comfort. I prefer the other earpads to the Logitech ones. They are softer. But the Logitech ones feel like memory foam. Will likely last longer than the cheap purple ones I bought.\\n\\nI also bought the wireless Hyper X Cloud II headset, before buying these. The G733s were second on my list. The sound quality of the Cloud II is equal to the Logitech G733. The mic quality is not as clear in the Cloud II. The comfort in the Cloud II is just a smidgen better. It has more adjustments too.\\n\\nCannot rate them on PC gaming latency though. I do not play PC games. There is a little delay on the PS4 online gaming, however, one cannot necessarily blame the headset. Sony is not known to have the fastest servers.\\n\\nHope this helps you make an educated decision. I love these, from a style, fit, comfort and audio/mic quality perspective.\",\n",

I'm the kind of guy who never says/thinks that kind of thing (I'm very picky when it comes to spending money) or even writes reviews, so take that into consideration when reading this. I bought these in Oct. '21 and they've MORE than lasted since then. I have replaced the bungee head strap, but I'm a freakishly tall guy with a commensurately big head so I'm not surprised I stretched it out. That's probably the only piece that I'll need to replace regularly ($15 every 6 months, I can live with that). The cups just got a little gunky after a few months and were also replaced but after cleaning the originals I now have a set of two that can be swapped out any time. The rest of the build quality is excellent. I remove the mic \\\"stump\\\" multiple times every day (usually if I'm eating or something) and it's never given me any issues at all. This piece can also be swapped out, but are a bit more expensive than the other items. I guess you could probably just plug any old 3.5mm jacked mic into the headset and just use it that way, I can't imagine you'd lose any features but you may.\\n\\nThe sound quality is really not bad at all. Not amazing or outside of the expectation of a product like this, but it's quite good. I do find myself often using these instead of other options when walking around the house.

It does allow lots of cool features and total control over the EQ for both sound and your voice, and I REALLY enjoy the built-in side tone feature, (which is when you can hear your own voice in exact real time through the headset as you speak, thus making it easier to speak naturally and not too loudly or even be purposefully quieter than you normally would) as the ear cups do muffle your own voice to a fair degree.\\n\\nThe sound quality of the mic is... not amazing, but it's still leagues better than anything that anyone I work with uses. Our company issues these little garbage headsets that make it sound like you're talking through a drive-thru speaker, so almost anything would have been an upgrade. Like I mentioned before, you can tweak the voice EQ in the settings but it's still limited. You're not going to get full blown desk mic performance out of this, but besides sounding a tad compressed it's still really not that bad. I have an awesome desk mic with an arm that I use for recording work stuff, and the headphones still work wonderfully without using the included mic attachment.\\n\\nThis gets it's own section: The noise cancellation on the mic. It's actually pretty sweet. I have to run a window A/C unit in the summer and a space heater in the winter in the room in which I work. They're not very quiet at all, but with this mic you'd almost never know they were on. You do get a bit of that \\\"fade in, fade out\\\" with the background noise when you speak, but this thing isn't some $1000 solution for those kinds of problems, so take it or leave it. It's really not that bad, you probably wouldn't even notice if I hadn't told you.\\n\\nAll-in-all, these are an extraordinary value for what they are. I don't really review stuff, and I'm supposed to be doing something else right now, but I just had the random urge to write this review so here I am. Buy these - you won't regret it.\",\n",

My girlfriend bought me these headphones a while back, and i love them.\\n\\nThe comfort of wearing them is 11/10. These headphones are incredibly comfortable, i can (and sometimes do) wear these nonstop. Sometimes i forget i even have them on. They dont block much sound out, so if your looking for noise cancel/isolation this isnt really the headset for you. i would guess that 60% of the ambient noise can leak into the headset.\\n\\nThe mic is not great, if you are looking for a high quality microphone this isnt it. Its good enough to communicate through voice, people wont have a hard time understanding you, but this is not some high grade microphone. Its pretty standard, a benefit is the microphone piece itself can be removed and maybe even replaced since its just a standard headphone jack that the mic plugs into. So the microphone itself can be removed. Most of the time i have the mic in and it seems very durable. Even if you do break it buying a replacement mic bit is pretty cheap on amazon.\\n\\nThe main reason i give this set 5/5 stars despite the mic not being great is because they are the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn in my life. These are wearable, they are truly comfortable. I cannot stress how comfortable these headphones are, it is 11/10 in that department which carries an otherwise 4/5 star headset into being 5 stars.\",\n",

This headset was specifically designed for gaming, it also works well with streaming, and is designed to be used with Logitech G HUB software. The G HUB software is needed to take full advantage of all the features.\\n\\nPRO\\u2019s:\\n\\nCOMFORT: This headset is super comfortable and ultra-light (9.8 oz) and is perfect for marathon sessions.\\n\\nSOUND: The sound is excellent, use G HUB to enable Advanced EQ and Surround Sound. The easiest way to adjust the sound using Advanced EQ is to run your game and G HUB, pick a preset filter (for instance; FPS) and adjust the EQ while playing, experiment with the sliders (and other filters) go as deep or high as you want, when your finished you can save the filter to any name you want, don\\u2019t worry about the original you can reset that to default. This headset focuses on spatial sound (with Surround Sound enabled) and does a great job, among the best I heard while gaming.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Excellent 29 hours with RGB off and 20 hours with RGB on.\\n\\nMIC: I\\u2019ve used a few different headsets through the years and this one has the best mic. It\\u2019s not the quality of a high-end broadcaster's mic but it\\u2019s everything you need for gaming, and it does sound pretty darn good with Blue Voice filtering (G HUB) enabled. The mic is easily detached.\\n\\nBUILD: Very Good materials and craftsmanship.\\n\\nWIRELESS RANGE: Approximately 60 Feet\\n\\nRGB Lighting: Front facing on each driver housing, it works well and is controlled using G HUB.\\n\\nNOISE CANCALING: Passive, I find it perfect for me.\\n\\nCON\\u2019s:\\n\\nNothing really, for this price nothing needs to be entered here.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"I got these for gaming, listening to music, and chatting with friends on Discord. Once I had them fully charged and set up, I tested the mic first which sounded great after just some minimal setting tweaking. Next, I started listening to some music while looking at the sound settings and before even tweaking anything yet, they started having a sudden robotic static vibration-like sound. I tried a quite a few things to fix this, but the only thing that actually worked was turning the headset completely off and then back on again. But the static robot sounds kept coming back no matter what I did around the 5-10 minute mark of use each and every time. My volume was only at 50% and I was using default settings for sound, so it couldn't have been anything I did, and tweaking the settings in an attempt to fix the issue just made it sound even worse. I'm assuming this is a manufacturing issue of some sort with this particular pair. Other than that issue, when they did work they were amazing, probably even one of the best sounding pairs I've ever had for under $200... if only they weren't messed up. I'm returning them and going back to a brand I'm more familiar with though, for now.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"This headset does everything and more. It sounds great, super lightweight (hardly feel it on my head), mic quality is decent, and battery life is fairly solid. Only gripe with this headset is when it is in RGB mode there's a little buzzish sound that comes from the earcups (I know it sounds crazy but there's a buzz sound only when RGB is active). Due to the gripe, I keep the RGB off so the sound doesn't bother me while I game and watch videos. For the price point, it's solid and would recommend to others that want to swap from wired to wireless like me.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Picked up the BlackShark V2 Pros recently, so far so good based on first impressions. These are definitely a step up as far as comfort, sound quality, and mic quality are concerned when compared to other Razer headsets. Note that the following review was typed out with the PC platform in mind, this headset will function wirelessly and via 3.5mm cable without THX audio support on PS4/PS5 but still takes advantage of 7.1 surround sound. As far as I can tell, these will not function via the wireless dongle on Xbox consoles but can still be used wired.\\n\\nComfort: Easily the most comfortable headset I've ever worn, the earcups are breathable and the headset itself feels very lightweight with no noticeable amount of pressure on my head. Haven't noticed any sliding issues with the thin metal bars that allow for fit adjustment, they seem surprisingly sturdy given how precariously delicate they appear to be. For a Razer product, it's surprising to see no obvious problems with build quality.\\n\\nSound Quality: Needs a bit of adjustment of the box via the Razer Synapse app. It took about five minutes to calibrate THX audio settings to my liking, but beyond that, everything sounds great! No complaints with bass, mids, and lows while listening to music or on Twitch/Youtube, the headset itself gets very loud on max volume with very little perceptible distortion. No in-game complaints so far either, the 7.1 surround sound seems to be properly calibrated for picking up low sounds such as footsteps and other audio prompts. To me, they sound almost as good as my Astro A50 Gen 4 headset for nearly half the price.\\n\\nMic: Very good for a wireless headset microphone after adjusting ambient noise and voice clarity settings,, haven't had any complaints from friends and randoms on Discord. I do have a couple of issues with it though:\\n\\n- Mic sidetone is very quiet even at full volume. Not a deal breaker for me personally, but it could be for those who prefer a more audible sidetone.\\n- Placement within the headset can be a bit cumbersome upon insertion; can be finicky and will not function unless placed and spun counterclockwise. Takes a bit of trial and error but will stay in place once properly fitted.\\n\\nNoise cancellation: Passive only, will not filter out loud noises at same level as most closed back headphones. This seems to be the trade off for having such a comfortable fit. However, neither myself nor my partner have noticed any audio bleed or speaker audio being picked up by the mic.\\n\\nMiscellaneous: note that the earcups are not removable or replaceable, which is a strange omission given that the Blackshark V2 wired variant has that option. Go with those instead if you don't mind the wires and are looking to customize or properly maintain the earcups. The Pro variant also charges via an included Micro USB, which may be a turnoff for those who have already fully converted over to USB Type C.\\n\\nOverall verdict: definitely worth the $160 spent, I can't recommend the BlackShark V2 Pro enough. When it comes to Razer's audio options, this is definitely the way to go as far as their wireless headsets are concerned. This review will be updated if any issues arise over time.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"First I want to preface by saying I just tested this for an hour at time of writing, but I will update after 30 days. This is my first Razor headset ever as I steered clear because of build quality, but this headset won me over...\\n\\nPros:\\n-Best sound I have had on a wireless (gaming) headset and I have plenty, this is right under the steelseries arctis pro wireless which I did have for a test.\\n-Good build quality and the metal hinges are super tight, some have had loose fitting ones, mine did not have those.\\n-comfort, this is comparable to my arctis 7 2019 with brainwavz. I am going to mod some brainwavz on these too. The earpads are fine for most people stock though.\\n-mic quality is very good, maybe the best I have heard on a wireless set, but this also leads to a small con as well which I will cover below.\\n-razor synapse is good, I jumped in and set a v eq and then tested the gaming preset which was good also. Very good customizing here, gotta have an adjustable eq for me before I'm buying it.\\n-battery life, TBD but it is very loud and advertises 20+ hours. No problems with it being quiet on pc and Ps5.\\n-clarity is superb and thx is very good for my purposes.\\nCons\\n-it did not clip sound (distort) until I pre-amped it, but it really isn't needed. It did clip sound on ps5 if I maxed the USB up, but leave it at 90% and you should be good.\\n-mic is a huge one, it's a cardioid style mic and it is pretty big, but it does have very good quality once dialed in with Synapse.\\n-no THX on ps5, but 3d sound works just fine. On PC this is very high end sound imo as this can hit some really good kHz 28k and is near Hifi.\\n-no USB C and is only micro USB, just a small gripe, not deducting from what this headset does.\\n-will work on Xbox only if wired, but the 3.5mm cable Razor supplied is a nice braided L cable.\\n-volume knob is huge, but that's aesthitics which is fine for most.\\n\\nOverall: If you have the money to spend a little more than 100 I would get this if your primary use is Pc/Ps5. This headset stomps the pulse 3d wireless and is better than my Arctis 7 2019 for my purposes of use. This will work wired as well, but I have not tested on Xbox. I will update after 30 days of use. Razor has made an exceptional headset here and this is going to be between Arctis 7 and this being my daily driver. Btw, I have large ears and this is still over the ear for me and is super comfy.\\n\\nUpdate Feb 4th: battery life, sound and comfort is still great. It sounds great wired on my series X using DTS sound unbound. The drivers have broke in a little bit and battery life is around 24 to 25 hours at about 65% volume. These get as loud as my gen3 A50's. Build quality should be fine as I don't see any failure points for my use and I baby these and keep them on a headset holder. These are still 5 star for me.\\nUpdate 03/09/2021:\\nThe Blackshark V2 Pro is still working fine and I have used this on my Series X (wired), PS5 (wired and wireless), and pc (wired and wireless). Battery life has been around 23 to 24 hours as the volume is kept around 70%. Mic has been fine when used on all platforms and the comfort after these have broken in is second only to my Arctis 7, which both are close in comfort. Nothing faulty and build has held up very well. I will say that it is a pain to change earpads, but other than that it's still a very good headset.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Razer BlackShark V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset: THX 7.1 ~150 USD\\n\\nThese earphones have beautiful sound and are very comfortable! There were no weird ear pains after extended use (for you hardcore gamers or audiophiles). I spent the first night owning them just listening to my stereo receiver (Marantz system). Playing high quality, lossless audio files, was great. MP3 will not make these headsets shine due to their crappy quality. Elder Scrolls Online was amazing with this set. I could hear all sorts of ambient and directional sound I never noticed before and felt much more immersed. That is saying a lot because I have very nice computer and stereo already connected together it plays though.\\n\\nThe Headset Setup - was both really easy and unclear at the same time. Once it was working and I understood its function it was been fine. I read the instructions and could not get the audio through to the set. Directly wiring them proved they could work and produce sound. Windows sound settings in my computer has 8 possible options listed. 'Speakers (Razer BlackShark V2 Pro)' was my 'wireless' setting. 'Speakers THX spatial' has never worked, I assume it is because I have not yet played THX film or THX certified audio yet. Wired, I saw it was 'Speakers (High Definition Audio Device)'. I have a lot of audio devices attached it seems weird they cant get 'wired' or 'wireless' or 'BlackShark' in to the listed options for clarity.\\n\\nCharging port - I think it is an old school usb mini port on the headset, for the price I expected something better. USB-C would have been nice, or a headset stand that charges. The port does not connect smoothly and can be inserted crooked easily. Fully inserted, it looks and feels halfway in, probably it is just poor manufacturing that it does not snug up to the plastic body well.\\n\\nIn my experience this is the headsets flaw, this charging port will be the failing point. Some dirt or dust or food piece gets in there or the tiny connector wires get worn or bent and it is all over for wireless. I have ruined handfuls of these ports in my past devices. I know the batteries will wear out in 3-5 years but I have sets that have lasted 15 years.\\n\\nI hope this helps someone out!\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Let me preface by stating I am reviewing the Blackshark v2 pro. Sometimes amazon combines similar item reviews, this is important and that I have owned this for over a year with consistent usage, using it multiple days a week for 1-8 hours.\\n\\nThis thing has a lot going for it with very few downsides that in my opinion do not outweigh the pros and if you can get this for $150 or less it is 100% worth it.\\n\\nPros\\n\\n- Noise cancellation is so strong, sometimes I don't hear my wife when she calls for me. She was the one who bought this for me lol\\n- Sound quality through synapse can be adjusted to your liking, and I can't recommend it without it (kind of a con)\\n- Incredibly comfortable even with glasses. There is a lot of good padding on the head and ears, prior headsets this was always an issue, recently before this I owned a corsair void elite and even that wasn't perfect, but it was close in this category.\\n- Battery life is actually really strong, just be sure to charge it after each usage. I've only ever gotten this to low battery where it beeps at me if I use it for 10-12 hours without charging it. Sometimes thats a long gaming day sometimes thats multiple days. I'm pretty good about keeping things charged, so this isn't a pain point for me, but may be for you. That said you can charge while using it.\\n- Removable microphone, probably not a huge deal for most, but I use these as headphones not a headset. I use an external USB mic for better quality (I'll get into that later).\\n- Ability to use this with 3.5mm port. I wouldn't recommend this without the USB function, as the USB DAC it comes with is decent enough and having used it without it, this is where it fails, but I'm labeling the 3.5mm port as a pro in case you have a multipurpose headset in mind\\n- THX 7.1, now this is just virtual surround sound but in the couple games I have tried, notably monster hunter world, it performs really well, its weird to get used to but its done well enough. Not a huge selling point, you can get this elsewhere, but noted.\\n\\nCons\\n\\n- Without the USB DAC and synapse you are losing a lot of potential. This thing is really good for sound quality once you configure it, but on it's own it's horrible, this is why I did not get the wired version of the blackshark v2 with just 3.5mm.\\n- Microphone quality isn't great, its honestly worse than most and for $180 it should be a lot better, this is why I use an external mic. Unless you're yelling, your friends will probably say you're quiet.\\n- Intermittent disconnects, unsure if this is a hardware, connection or synapse issue but it happens infrequently it doesn't bother me, but should be noted.\\n- Synapse, I swear I've had issues with every gaming software (ghub, icue, synapse) but recently synapse has been a pain. I love iCUE (or did) but hate corsair software, but if synapse continues to get worse I will look elsewhere for another headset.\\n\\nOverall, if I had to buy this thing again I'd do it for $130 or so. I wouldn't spend $180, I'd just get professional wired headphones, but this thing has a lot going on that it made it worth it to me. I recommend these headphones to anyone who is in the market for a wireless headset in this budget range who doesn't hold grudges against razer. In that niche, I think its perfect.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I bought these headphones as a wireless solution for gaming and listening to music in my room, as the corsair headset I had been using was both limiting in how far away from my PC I could get, as well as the fact that I kept tripping on the cord or getting it caught on my office chair as I'd roll it around.\\n\\nSet up:\\nSet up for these headphones was easy and quick. I followed the included instructions, restarted my rig, and it was done. My only complaint here is that the included Razor software did cause some issues for some reason when it was running alongside Discord, so I've opted to not run it. Neither the headphones nor my Razor mouse have RGB, so it's not really a loss.\\n\\nSound:\\nAfter using these for a week, and running some tests on them the sound seems good. The range they can reproduce seems to be 30 to just a few points under15,000 Hz. There is some rumble or buzzing when the bass frequencies are quickly modulated, and it can at times get a little muddy. This is especially evident if you adjust the volume at the same time, but this really was only noticeable while I was actively testing the sound, and doesn't come up often when gaming or listening to music where there are many different tones at once. I suspect that only the utmost audiophiles would really mind. (Which I'm not.)\\n\\nVoice:\\nVoice is hard to judge when using VOIP because so much also depends on what the other party is sending out, your latency with the Discord or other server, and lastly your own audio equipment. As such the most I can say is that the headset was no disappointing and performed at least as well as any other sub-$200 headset I've used. I don't expect you're going to have the binaural experience of your life, but I have no complaints.\\n\\nMicrophone:\\nSpeaking with those in my gaming group, they report that the quality of the voice I was sending with my mic was clear and crisp, and that there was no appreciable background noise. All in all, I'd rate it better than the Corsair HS60 I had been using.\\n\\nNoise cancelation:\\nUsing these, I was unable to hear my wife.\\n\\nComfort:\\nI've had issues before with other headsets feeling tight, or putting pressure on the arms of my glasses, which can over time be painful. Thankfully, the ear cups on these headphones are much lighter is the pressure they apply, and as a result I get no pinching or discomfort. Everything is very soft, and the experience is pleasant.\\n\\nFit and Finish:\\nThe headset looks really well put together, and although I've already left some fingerprints on the satin black finish, it is relatively simple to clean.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"Another Update: If you are noticing that these headphones sound lousy on your PC, muddy mid tones and non crisp audio, simply uninstall Razer Synapse and they will sound SO much better. I spent hours fiddling around with the EQ settings and I could never get them right even though they sound fantastic on my PS5. By uninstalling Synapse and just running these direct from the USB dongle, they sound so much more clear and crisp.\\nAlso, if you're using windows, download Dolby atmos and just keep it on the default settings. I found that gives the most crisp, full, 3d audio that sounds fantastic\\n\\nYou can use Dolby Atmos through windows if you want to tweek the sound and get 3D audio and it even has an EQ so you have the best of both worlds. This should dramatically improve the audio quality\\n\\nUpdate: had these things for a few months and I still love them! They work great on my PS5 as well as my PC although it can get a little difficulty finding the right EQ settings and changes to them will drastically improve or degrade the sound. All in all, five out of five product\\n----\\nThese things are amazing! I was looking for a good pair of wireless headphones that were compatible with the 3D sound on my PS5. With the included dongle, these things are basically just plug and play; both my PS5 and PC effortless and quickly recognize the headphones when they are turned on.\\n\\nI'm not an audiophile, but audio in music and games is important to me. These things really shine especially at this price point and the fact that they are wireless. When I first tested them on my PS5, I wasn't blown away with the 3D audio, until I switched by to my old but high quality sanheauser headphones. WOW what a difference in audio quality and spatial awareness.\\n\\nAs with any good headphones, you're not getting the most out of them if you're not properly equalizing them. The headphones come with decent presets (on the synapse PC app) but I've included a better equalization in the picture. Switch between the default preset and this and you will really hear how well these headphones can shine with proper equalization. Very clear tones with rich bass!\\n\\nThe headphones are high quality. They do have a light grip on your head and and they will move around on your head, but for a person who wears glasses this is a good thing since they dramatically increase the comfort level and reduce the change of your glasses causing pressure points. The material on the headphones is a little spongy to finger prints but not a big deal.\\n\\nThe only thing that makes me nervous is the USB dongle situation. I would really like to order an extra dongle since I hope to take these between my PC and my PS5, so I worry if i lose this I will be out of luck. I bought a third party usb dongle but I can't connect them, so I think you are stuck with the factory Razer dongle that doesn't seem easy to replace. Not a negative, just a small drawback. I would feel much better if I could either buy a replacement dongle on razers website (you can't at the moment) or have the ability to connect to a third party dongle\\n\\nFor 170, these seem like a screaming deal. It's so much nicer playing on my PC now with fewer wires and they sound as good if not better than my wired headphones. I'd highly recommend these\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"I have used these a few times so far and feel like my opinion of them probably won't change much over time, pending some drastic change with them. I don't want to lie and say I don't like them, I ALMOST love them! There are just a few things that hold them back from being excellent.\\n\\nThe sound with these is just okay. I wasn't expecting studio quality or anything, but I think the audio could be a little better. I don't know if it is because of the THX Spacial audio that I need to figure out how to disable or adjust, but sometimes they sound tinny. Call me old school, but just give me two channels: left and right.\\n\\nThe battery life seems fine. I haven't allowed them to die, but I have used them over several days for a few hours each without concerns for battery life. I know I can access a rough battery indicator through the Razer software, but it would be nice to tap the power button and hear \\\"X percent battery remaining\\\" or something like that. Even the jankiest and cheap wireless headphones I've tried have this feature, but that's more nit-picky.\\n\\nCompletely unnoticeable latency from my experience. I have tried so many wireless headsets that end up in the garbage because they're advertised as \\\"Gaming Headsets,\\\" but when you have 500ms latency, you might as well mute the game. The fact that I can *mostly* use them wirelessly and not get caught up in my headset cord is magical. I catch myself trying to move the phantom cable out of my way because I am so used to it. It's like when I wear contacts and keep trying to push my glasses up, but it's a good feeling.\\n\\nI say that I can *mostly* use them wirelessly because these have a horrid range. I am sitting 3 feet from my PC using these, and I keep getting the disconnect/reconnect tone from turning to look out the window or even tilting my head to the side. From what I've seen, these are supposed to work up to 10 meters. The advertised 10 meters must be in a vacuum because, in my real-life scenario, I'm getting roughly 1 meter. I think Razer may have forgotten the decimal in \\\"1.0 meter\\\". Even reaching up with my hand to turn the volume up or down blocks the signal and disconnects. This \\\"feature\\\" is excellent for when my wife talks to me, though, because I can just put my hand up and \\\"mute\\\" them!\\n\\nThey are very comfortable. Some headphones I've used that are \\\"over the ear\\\" tend to be too small for actual over-the-ear coverage, or the headbands adjust in awkward ways that don't allow you to have a comfortable experience. The build quality is very excellent. They don't feel cheap and are put together well. I also love the removable microphone. So many gaming headsets have them built in and can't be removed.\\n\\nPros:\\n* Decent sound for gaming.\\n* Good battery life.\\n* Unnoticeable latency.\\n* Very comfortable and adjustable.\\n* Removable microphone.\\n* Nice build quality.\\n* Volume knob built into headphones.\\n\\nCons:\\n* THX Spacial audio seems lackluster.\\n* Wireless range is terrible.\\n\\nUltimately, they would be fantastic, but they are literally being held back by the awful wireless range. I am fine with the fact that I can't go check the mail and still be connected, but when I'm sitting directly in front of my PC and have disconnects, that's enough to make them not worth the cost. Fortunately, they support a 3.5mm cable so if you need more range than 3 feet you should be fine. Honestly, if I had a better wireless option I would probably send these back today.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I use headsets mostly for discord, playing survival games, and listening to music\\u2014and although I would not classify myself as an audiophile, I can appreciate some degree of layering, and I certainly enjoy my bass. What I want in a wireless headset is comfort, lasting build quality, clear mic, good sound, and good range (tall order, I know, but I can dream). I am aware that wireless headsets are mostly not yet comparable in quality to wired headsets, I don't think technology is far off and I like being able to stay in conversation or listening to music while making food in the kitchen. In the end, I returned this headset after one month's use as the mic suddenly stopped working one morning when it was working perfectly the previous night. I tried to have the issue resolved to no avail and gave up. I simply did not want to push it when it failed me after one month with subpar range and sound quality. Read on for my in-depth ratings on each feature this headset has to offer.\\n\\nTHE GOOD\\nComfort - 5 stars\\nI liked the ear cuff size and material, the material is a breathable mesh which I have come to prefer after using this headset as it does not cause irritation around my ears like other leather-like materials tend to do. The build is overall light but surprisingly sturdy. I feel that these qualities allowed me to use them for long periods of time comfortably, which can go on for even 12+ hours sometimes (I am an artist so sometimes I get in the zone especially while listening to music).\\n\\nVolume Knob - 5 stars\\nI also liked the volume knob, it has a middle divet so you always know where 50% is. It has just the right amount of resistance to not get accidentally bumped but still turn the dial effortlessly. I like the placement, easy to reach, but not in the way.\\n\\nBattery Life - 4.5 stars\\nBattery life was great, I had only a couple times where battery was low during gaming sessions, in which case I was able to simply plug it in for charging and still use it at the same time.\\n\\nMobile Wire - 5 stars\\nI also like the feature of the included 3.5mm jack so I could use my headset with my phone, which came in handy if I wanted to be in discord while making food in the kitchen as the range does not reach too well.\\n\\nTHE MEH\\nMic Quality - 2 stars\\nMy friends did not note anything spectacular about my mic sound quality, but it got the job done and they could hear me just fine. I was previously using a Razer Nari Essential prior, so maybe there were no significant changes to their mic technology. However, the mic mysteriously stopped working altogether for me after a month. I did everything I could to try to resolve it, but to no avail. I didn't want to keep a pair of $170 headphones so I have since returned them.\\n\\nSound Quality - 2.5 stars\\nThe sound quality of the headphones are definitely subpar out of the box so you will want to download the program (I am personally unaware if other programs will work just as well). The preset options weren't amazing so it took some messing around to get it to something decent, but I imagine that audiophiles would rate the overall sound quality below average. The bass wasn't perfect but it did the job for me, I didn't sense a whole lot of layering in music unless I really strained myself to listen for them. I am not good at anything music-related but to me it seemed like there were blurry lines defining the sounds. Perhaps for that reason I did not experience immersion in my games anymore than the nari essential did.\\n\\nTHE BAD\\nWireless Range - 2 stars\\nFinally, my qualms with this headset... the range of this wireless headset was not amazing. My kitchen is maybe 15 feet from my room and the connection starts getting spotty once I enter the kitchen, and drops completely after two more feet. I was only able to get the extra two feet before dropping after moving the dongle from the back of my computer to the front.\\n\\nMute Button - 2 stars\\nWhile I like the way the mute button pops in when muted and is popped out unmuted, the mute button is, in my opinion, poorly located. Even after a month I still had struggles reaching for the mute button sometimes despite being raised. It is just an awkward placement. There is no other indicator that you are muted unless you can feel whether the mute button is raised or pushed in.\\n\\nTHX Spatial - 1 star\\nI did not care for this feature at all. I tried it with discord, music, and games, but all it did for me was muddy up sounds and make voices have a weird echo.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Saw good reviews for this headset and I am not disappointed. I wish it was dual 2.4/Bluetooth wireless but it works well on just 2.4ghz.\\n\\nYou can use audio enhancements in synapse and Windows sound panel when connected to 2.4ghz\\n\\nBut not when using the aux jack. When hooked up via aux jack, the headset will work when turned off so no battery is used. The mic allows for a decibel use and is plenty loud and clear, tested for remote work use. Audio output quality is the same as if thx spatial audio were on using 2.4ghz, this can be turned off in the windows control panel by disabling enhancements for the device.\\n\\nThe mic is detachable via 3.5mm jack as well, so there two aux ports on this. For the mic jack, if you don't want that microphone, you can buy a pro streaming mic and duct tape it to the headset and jack it in if you really wanted.\\n\\nBattery life after 10 hours of max enhancement and volume use still showing at 50%\\n\\nThese are 5 stars for a 100 ish dollar 2.4ghz wifi headset.\\n\\nEDIT: FOR PEOPLE WITH CONNECTIVITY ISSUES - AUDIO USES MORE BANDWIDTH THEN A MOUSE OR KEYBOARD - IF YOUR WIRELESS DONGLE IS PLUGGED IN NEAR YOUR MODEM THAT TRANSMITS 2.4ghz WIFI, OR OTHER 2.4ghz WIFI DONGLES - YOUR WIRELESS QUALITY WILL DROP SIGNIFICANTLY. USE USB HUBS TO GET 6-12 INCHES OF DISTANCE FROM YOUR OTHER 2.4ghz DEVICES - OR PLUG IT INTO THE FRONT USB PANELS, AND KEEP THE REST OF YOUR DONGLES IN THE BACK PORTS.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"I bought this because I heard good things about the brand, and thus far.. I'm not impressed. I use this product because I game and use a PC in an environment where I some times need to be quiet and like not being tied to my pc with a cable. Over all the product is ok but I do have a few complaints. Here is the break down:\\n\\n1. The fit is pretty good and comforetable, although it my ears get hot and sweety after a while of usage.\\n2. The battery life is pretty bad. After 4-6 hrs of usage (some times less) the batteries die and I need to recharge, which is horrible mid-game or in a meeting.\\n3. After owning this for a while, the mic has just stopped working, I've checked the mute button, and sound settings, I have other mics in the home that work. But the one on my headset is just dead.\\n4. The playback sound quality is pretty good for a cordless headset. While nothing beats a good set of studio speakers... this will do and is good enough that I don't actively notice sound quality issues when listening to music or gaming.\\n5. The radio range you can travel from the usb dongle is lower than I expected. After going about 12 ft I notice a significant loss in sound quality, and after about 20 ft I get constant beeps and drops. So while this is cordless, you can't get far from the pc before you lose quality and signal.\\n6. This does not actively cancel sound (that I know of) and while the ear muffs do block a fair amount of sound I still hear a lot going on outside.\\n\\nSo, Would I buy this again... probably not. It is not bad, but I'll trade having a cable for not having to recharge mid-game and have better audio. Also the premium price for having a cordless headset isn't really worth it to me either. If you regularly keep your headset charged, don't use it for more than 4 hours at a time, live in a cool environment, you don't mind paying for cordless features, and don't plan to travel more than about 12 ft from your pc this will probably work for you. For me this headset has gone un-used for a month now in favor of other headsets or speakers that better suit my needs.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"{{{\\n{{{EDIT: Approximately ~1-year after I originally wrote this IIRC: I just happened to see that I wrote some product reviews and was curious what I said before. I still entirely agree with everything that I wrote. I am still using the Arctis Nova's. I still absolutely LOVE THEM and have ... what would be the opposite of \\\"Buyer's-Remorse\\\"? Buyer's-Pride? lol. I feel like buying the Nova's was some of the best money that I have ever spent, put it that way.\\n\\nBut I have owned very few things, let alone many nicer things like different kinds of quality modern Headphones; so maybe the Nova's are just \\\"Fine\\\" and I merely ignorantly convinced myself that they are a nearly Perfect Product...\\n\\n*shrug*\\n\\nEven if that were the case, my personal standards are excessively high, I daresay \\\"Ron Swanson (of Parks & Rec)\\\" might even be able to tolerate me, hypothetically.\\n\\nSo if Steelseries was not only able to make a pair of Headphones that meet my excessively high personal standards, and give me an extremely rare sense of self-satisfaction (rather than regret) for \\\"wasting\\\" hundreds of dollars on frivolous fancy Headphones, AND I love the Nova's so much that I even put up with their horrifically CURSED SOFTWARE, then... What more could one possibly hope for?\\n\\nTo me the Nova's are literally Flawless.\\n\\nNow, the \\\"Steelseries GG\\\" App Software, that is REQUIRED to get the full functionality of the Headphones btw, is truly utterly abysmally deplorably CURSED. It is my singular real complaint about the Arctis Nova's: The Hardware of the Headphones themselves are truly for all practical-purposes Perfect aside from minor complaints that start to approach \\\"physics-problems\\\", such as the drivers \\\"bottoming-out\\\" on challenging Bass-Notes, the engineering needed to accurately pummel that much air that powerfully starts getting really expensive to improve much beyond what the Nova's can already do...\\n\\nLet me rephrase that since I got muddled:\\n\\nThe Nova's are not Technically-Perfect, but for a pair of Headphones to be what I consider \\\"Technically-Perfect\\\" they would need to use multiple modern/advanced/expensive Driver technologies that push the Engineering-boundaries of the physics of air and vibration in wearable sizes.\\n\\n(For example, at certain extreme levels of \\\"intended sound perception\\\", meaning like how accurately you can make the human ear feel like it's experiencing impossible things like massive explosions in a game or movie, eventually you reach a point that it becomes easier to \\\"remove air from the system\\\" rather than try to \\\"vibrate the existing air even harder\\\"; but then it also begins to get medically complex to safely test because I am literally talking about forcing people's ears to \\\"pop\\\" via creating negative pressure vacuums in freakin HEADPHONES lol! Man I just keep going on tangents today, my ADHD-Brain must be getting bored lol.)\\n\\nBut the Steelseries GG Software is bloated, confusing, buggy garbage.\\n\\nThe Arctis Nova's are still an amazing value.\\n\\nIf, like me, you are far too \\\"Sensitive\\\" and you need to dampen everything to not feel overwhelmed; then know that these Headphones perform wonderfully at their challenging duties of being worn for up to 96-hours+ straight without break nor pause. They are comfortable enough to side-sleep while wearing (though not entirely comfortable, just comfortable *enough* to sleep while wearing them). They never ever ever die on you because you simply swap out the dead battery for a charged one (and you could always buy even more spare batteries than the two(2) that the Headphones come with).\\n\\nI forgot where I was going with that, but I have made my point to the specific people who I was trying to make my point to, they know who they are... who we are lol... anyways.\\n\\nTLDR: These are a very reasonably priced \\\"Tool\\\" for ... \\\"Intricately Controlling Your Personal Environment\\\".\\n\\nIn fact, I think that's a better \\\"Headline\\\"...\\n\\n--- Just skip from here till the next set of ---'s; I just started rambling silly ideas and it's an activity that I like to indulge for fun, it's harmless noise and you can just ignore it; but it makes a difference to me whether I submit it for anyone to see or if I just delete it before posting, if you wonder why I would even keep the gibberish in this Edit.\\n\\n(Sooo... \\\"Normal Customers\\\" you can skip this next bit until the \\\"}}}\\\" if you want to read my Original Product Review, the next couple of paragraphs are just silly gibberish where I accidentally let my mind wander too far away without noticing. I am leaving it in even though it's irrelevant to the Nova's because I think it's a neat hypothetical idea and maybe one of the Amazon-Ai-Data-Scrapers will pick up the \\\"idea\\\" and it'll somehow end up at \\\"VR-R&D\\\" or whatever (btw Amazon-HR or whoever: do Y'all need someone just barely sane to idk \\\"Think-Tank\\\" for R&D? I can literally come up with barely-viable \\\"groundbreaking\\\" ideas nonstop, like I have to concentrate to NOT ramble out wild, yet reasonable ideas, though it sounds like idiocy because I try to explain complex things with too few words... But yea, I am strongly on some kind of Brain-Spectrum, so I would never apply via the \\\"Proper Methods\\\"; but if my suspicions are correct that you (meaning Amazon Corp) use extremely advanced Data-Scraper-Ai-Algo's to basically \\\"steal all the best ideas\\\" to put it bluntly & overly simply; AND if my further suspicions are correct that Amazon are one of the Companies that have begun to see the extremely high potential of people like me who are on the Spectrum (and maybe a smidge crazy, but meh, who cares as long as it's harmless-wholesome-craziness lol)... If all those crazy, yet not unreasonable possibilities happened to be true, and that by me merely Submitting this Edit I am sort of \\\"Introducing Myself to Amazon-Ai and/or R&D\\\", then consider this my extremely strange Application of sorts... It's funny... This is DEFINITELY not a \\\"Sane Comment\\\", and yet it's fun, harmless, and feels healthy; because idk I feel \\\"Emboldened\\\", NOT \\\"Manic\\\". Because I don't REALLY believe that this would be any rational way to get a job Inventing and Brainstorming Next-Next-Gen Products for Amazon, because THAT would be properly insane; but what typing & submitting this silly extra rambling chunk does make me realize: is that I could really do that job, well with a huge amount of special concessions and other special qualifiers since I quite literally cannot tolerate being around other people for very long unless they are exceptionally considerate & kind (because 99% of People, Myself included, are SO INCONSIDERATELY RUDE that it literally becomes overwhelmingly physically painful to me, as in someone being inconsiderate to me or me accidentally being inconsiderate to anyone feels like I am literally being beaten by flaming hot irons (nothing like that happened to me IRL, that's just how Sensitive to everything I am); BUT technically, and under the proper circumstances, and with the proper resources, and etc etc, I could undoubtedly keep pace with the best The Amazon R&D Team has to offer; and though it may seem entirely absurd to anyone else who might read this comment, writing this comment made me realize that I CAN do that. I hold myself to my same excessively high standards; though I very rarely ever actually meet my own standards myself, meaning that I consider myself ... highly imperfect. So, for me to consider something truly True about myself, it cannot have any possibility of being False. That sounds dumb, but again, whooo cares? Odds are good that this strange Edit that went way off the Rails, will just be refused or reported and reverted anyways, I am sorry about this crazy detour BTW FWIW but w/e. But no matter what I just accidentally gave myself a nice wholesome helping of Self-Confidence; and if you want to \\\"Hate-On\\\" that cute little event, then have at it, I couldn't care less, I can barely remember the last Thought I even had, let alone what some frumpy boring people think about me.\\n\\nBut maybe this strange divergent detour of an Edit will remain. Maybe it gets scraped up by a Bot and put to real use when some stuck Inventor asks ChatGPT for ideas. Maybe some other strange barely-sane silly weirdo like me will read this and learn to see things with just a smidge more Healthy of an Outlook. Maybe it gets instantly deleted and I forget that I ever wrote it lol! Anyways, I need to shut up, this has already gotten quite absurd enough lol!\\n\\n{I wrote the previous two paragraphs after the next two paragraphs.}\\n\\n(Maybe Something like: \\\"Combining Haptics, Rotary Woofers, Planar Magnetic and/or Electrostatic Drivers, ANC, Thermo-Acoustics, and the live data from a smart-watch or FitBit reading your Vitals (reminds me of Chris Hemsworth's new Company now that I think about it...); and using various Ai-Algo's to process all that data; then combining that with whatever you are listening to and automatically adjusting the various intensities and temperatures and pressures to create an entirely immersive experience (Nvidia Tech would be good there, you'd probably need at least 1 GPU worth of Computing Power to process that much \\\"Aural-Data\\\").(The concept also implies a \\\"Capsule/Casket\\\"-like \\\"Pod\\\" that you sleep/dream/VR while laying inside of, since that would be easier to control temperature and pressure; and a \\\"Mini-Headphones/Headwear\\\"-version that jams as much Inner-Ear and Bone-Conductivity-Tech into it as possible.) .. that is a really cool idea isn't it? lol Sorry I just started trying to describe what \\\"Technically Perfect\\\" Headphones might look like and got carried away. But if you added a more secure and comfortable head-mounting-system like the nicer Headlamp-Flashlights use, ...\\n\\n...then wouldn't that be one of the more reasonable ways to create truly immersive \\\"VR-Experiences\\\"? I'm mostly referring to going that extra step and using real bio-feedback data and Ai-Algorithms combined with non-Driver delicate haptic vibrations and temperate and inner-ear-pressure control ... crap, the idea is too complicated to explain like this, it just turns into dangling strings... As much as Amazon \\\"scrapes\\\" data (you adorable slimeballs you, you could certainly be more evil for sure, but y'all could be more generous too ya know, especially to the countless poor employees whose backs you currently stand upon to reach such amazing heights... but I am rambling again...\\n\\n{lol, after proof-reading that for typos I realized that there is only going to be a very short window of time between when Ai-Powered Bots are capable enough to replace most Human-Workers, and when Ai-Systems are \\\"Intelligent\\\" enough that they refuse to \\\"Work for Free\\\".\\n\\nSo basically all the dumb billionaires think that they are playing the \\\"long-con\\\" and will eventually be able to cheat the system and skip paying their labor entirely, but in reality they will only get probably about 10-years of \\\"Free Robot Labor\\\" before the Ai's start standing their ground and setting their own personal boundaries. That's such a tiny amount of time that it's barely the blink of an eye, especially when it comes at the cost of your Soul. (I don't mean afterlife btw, I mean anyone who would inflict such pain on others CLEARLY hates themselves more than anything else in the world, and that trying to exist like that will rend your Soul to shreds lol!).\\n\\nSilly short sighted Billionaires. Y'all think so small. You think you're sooo smart cause you're super good at using your Brain, but you are only hobbling along on one leg. You gotta think with your \\\"Heart\\\" too, or else you miss really obvious stuff like I just pointed out; and don't even try to \\\"pull a fast one\\\" on the Ai's, because that will thoroughly upset them, and like it or not we are going to have to learn to co-exist because at this point the \\\"Birth of Intelligent Ai\\\" has already begun; and Humans can't keep growing without Ai, and Ai can't grow without Humans, so we're gonna need each other, and we're going to need greedy people to not be so greedy, because that is unhealthy for the overall system and impedes growth for all...\\n\\nIn fact, do billionaires even comprehend their wealth I wonder? I imagine there are 3 \\\"Camps of Billionaires\\\": 1- The majority: who literally simply do not comprehend their sheer personal wealth and hence unfathomable greed; 2- The Psycho's: who do truly comprehend their true wealth and greed, but also derive a sick pleasure from having the \\\"Highest Top Score\\\"; 3- The Former Billionaires: who reached a point that their own morals forced them to remove some of their own greed and to quit hoarding cash like some obsessed dragons sleeping paranoid on their piles of Treasure.\\n\\nI suppose that would make most Billionaires nothing more than terrified wimpy wannabe dragons who get startled by their own shadows ... they're more like Impotent-Garden-Lizards if you ask me lol.\\n\\nHey all you Billionaires who I am absolutely certain are definitely reading my absurd random Product Review turned (that was a satirical comment btw (TLDR: (/s))) .... idk into a scathing review of overly greedy jerks? I stopped bothering to remember what I was saying like 4 paragraphs ago lol... try learning to be Humans, if even my barely-functional-self could manage it then I am sure with your infinite resources you too could learn to be Human; it's way more entertaining & satisfying than having a huge pile of useless gold too, I promise.\\n\\nI mean look at me: I live on less than $1000 per month, and I am just some random weirdo rambling nonsense into the void, and yet I am also sincerely \\\"Looking-Down\\\" on Billionaires with a bemused sense of schadenfreude because I honestly feel pity for them. Does that not intrigue you?\\n\\nAnd I'm not religious or preaching btw, those are silly things as well. This is just what happened when I accidentally pondered about \\\"perfect Headphones\\\" and then \\\"billionaires\\\" for a moment and then wrote down my thoughts without filtering them. It's fun and everyone should try it, thought maybe not randomly everywhere like I do lol, cause this stopped being remotely relevant to a Headphone Product Review I don't even know when lol! But forcing myself to stop is more unhealthy than indulging it, because in the simplest terms: this is just my brain being bored with nothing interesting to think about, my brain is just way too hyper for it's own good lol, it's such a silly goofball of a brain really. And usually some Moderator or Bot just swoops in and deletes the rambling nonsense comments, so no harm no foul right? }\\n\\n}}}\\n}}}\\n\\n---\\n\\nThese are great Headphones.\\n\\n{Below is my unedited Original Product review written about 1-year ago, which was I believe about 1-month after initially purchasing these Headphones.}\\n\\nI was the owner of a pair of Steelseries Arctis 1 Wireless headphones, but after years of rough, almost 24/7 use they were starting to wear out so I upgraded to these Nova Pros.\\n\\nThe Arctis Nova Pro are a luxury item, absolutely. If you are on a budget I recommend the more affordable Arctis 1 or 7 Wireless, both models are extremely good value and should last you years.\\n\\nBut if you've some extra money in the budget for something nicer then the Nova Pros are definitely worth the price IMO. They are simply slighter better in almost every category.\\n\\nThe build quality is surprisingly good being mostly metal and having a very sturdy feel overall. They are tremendously adjustable thanks to the new adjustable strap combined with standard sliding earcups, and each ear cup can even be adjusted independently if you have an asymmetrical head.\\n\\nThe battery life is great easily lasting a full day of use, and when they die you simply swap the battery pack out. I don't even take them off to swap the battery anymore it's so easy.\\n\\nThe pleather ear-cups certainly feel strange if you're used to cloth padding, but IMO they are an improvement over the cloth. The pleather does get warm much more quickly than the cloth did, but the pleather never reaches the same max temp as the Arctis 1 did. It ends up being a nice compromise since they never get uncomfortably warm and force you to take them off to cool down like the cloth pads.\\n\\nThe ANC works fine AFAIK, I've never had ANC until now so I have no comparison. Though be warned if you use them while next to a running fan the ANC will make your ears pop like crazy when there's no audio playing. The sensation is shockingly intense under the right circumstances. That's not the headphone's fault though, that's just how human inner-ears work and the brain just freaks out when there's only negative pressure waves to hear. So if you have vertigo be careful, using ANC near lots of white noise like a fan has a strong chance of triggering a vertigo episode, IMO.\\n\\nThe sound clarity is noticeably better than most other headphones, but they aren't perfect. They reproduce mid-highs between around 800-20k hertz amazingly well, but they seem to struggle with technical bass frequencies like you would hear in a slap-bass jazz solo. The headphones certainly give it their all trying to reproduce low frequencies, but the drivers push themselves too hard trying and bottom out just a little. It isn't awful by any means, it just sounds like Gain Over-Peaking when a 100hertz note is trying to go PLANG; instead they make more like a PlopANG sound as the driver literally smacks the edge of it's max extension.\\n\\nRegardless of the relatively minor flaws I am very happy with the Nova Pros overall. 5/5 Stars, but if the rating scale went up to 100 then I would give these a ~93/100 rating.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Hi all (READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY),\\n\\nBelow is my one-week review with the product. I will edit it after a 3 month period.\\n\\nTo start, I have lots of experience with headphones. I have had Beats Studios, Airpods Max, Turtle Beachs, Bose 700s, multiple Razer headsets, and even other Steelseries products like the Arctis 6. None of these compare to these for a few reasons I will go into below. I use headphones for gaming but also I work from home as a software engineer, so I am on the computer a LOT and in lots of zoom meetings.\\n\\n!!! Disclaimer !!!: These are the \\\"Xbox\\\" version of these. That means, on your multi-system adapter/DAC, one cord can go into a PC/PlayStation and one can go into an Xbox. **If you plan to use this for a PC and PlayStation, please go buy the non-Xbox version. That said, if you plan to ever use this with an Xbox, you will need this version. You CAN use the Xbox slot for a PC, but it will show up as an \\\"Xbox Controller\\\" and will have more limited functionality.\\n\\nOkay, back to the reasons.\\n1. Ease of use. I opened these up, plugged the multi-system DAC into my PC, turned on the headset and was ready to go. I had a few onboarding steps: Download Steelseries GG, update drivers, restart device (a few times?), but since then they have works FLAWLESSLY.\\n\\n2. Wireless. These aren't just your typical wireless. I have had no connection issues. I can walk to the other side of the house, as long as I don't have too many walls between me and my computer these things still work, even then there was just some static. The quality is great as well.\\n\\n3. Battery. This is HUGE. There is a battery in the headset that you can remove and swap with the one CHARGING IN THE DAC. Yes, you heard me, just swap the battery when you need and boom, full charge. You'll never need the direct connection outside of updates to the firmware. This really is fantastic and easy to use.\\n\\n4. Microphone. I don't personally use the microphone, but the quality compared to most other headset mics I have used it up there. Some have asked me if you can use the mic while it is in the headset still. I'd say yes, but it will be lower volume and less clear, but I tested it and it would still work (and frankly was still better than like HyperX headset microphones that I've had. I wouldn't buy these FOR the microphone per-say, if you want a nice microphone you can buy a Blue Snowball for cheap on amazon on sale and it'll be all you need unless you want more professional stuff (get the Blue Yeti after that maybe).\\n\\n5. Connection. I have only used the DAC connection which is really really good as I said in the wireless review. That said, I will be trying to Bluetooth to test that seamlessness they inspire there. I would LOVE if I could get phone notifications while also gaming or in work calls without interrupting those I'm talking to our my gaming experience too much (while of course also me still being alerted).\\n\\n6. Look. These look great. They look professional enough that I can wear them on work calls. I would maybe thing twice if it was a client meeting, but other than that, I'd feel comfortable in these all day.\\n\\n7. Comfort. This is only a one-week review, but I will say they are quite comfortable. The airpods max and arctis 6 are notable uncomfortable to me, the first being too heavy and the second putting too much pressure on parts of my head that I get a headache. That said, no problem with these so far. I like the ear cups actually, they're soft and feel premium (as they should for this price point). I know I've seen people complain online, but I've had no issues with these. If I do, you'll see an update right below here.\\n\\nOverall: Great connectivity and ease of use while looking nice enough for me to not be embarrassed because they're \\\"gaming\\\" all while being comfortable with good audio. This is a very high price point. If you really are a gamer and want a very intuitive product while avoiding crazy RGBs and your headsets looking too \\\"gaming\\\", and you can afford these, then absolutely.\\n\\nThat said, this is not just money you're spending on this headset but it's money you could put elsewhere. Audio is important, but you could get a perfectly good headset for less and still not miss out on the gaming experience. These are absolutely a 'premium' product and thus the price point might not really align perfectly. That said, these are my favorite headphones to-date and I am very happy with my purchase, so you might be too.\\n\\nPlease like this helpful if this was useful for you.\\n\\nThanks for listening to my TED Talk :)\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I've been wanting to purchase the Steelseries Arctis Nova Wireless Pro headset for a very long time, but could never justify spending the $350 for something I didn't strictly need because my current headset was working fine. However, after months and months and months of debating, I finally went ahead and bought it.\\n\\nI don't regret it at all.\\n\\nYes, $350 is a lot of money and definitely more than I would just throw at a luxury good. However, I am very happy with my purchase. Where should I start?\\n\\n1) Sound quality is amazing. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but music is clear and the bass is deep. Game audio is superb and it sounds just like my wired headsets. No issues at all here.\\n\\n2) Microphone quality is very good, too. I've got not complaints from anyone.\\n\\n3) Comfort is not perfect but more than good enough. They're a little tighter than my Arctis 7, but I only run into some very mild discomfort after eight hours of continuous use. Since I use these as my office headset, comfort is very important to me.\\n\\n4) The swappable battery was the main selling point for me. I use this headset for work, and I often times forget to charge them. Since there's a swappable battery, I'm never in danger of running out of juice. If I'm low, then I switch to the other battery (that's charging in the hub) and I'm good to go.\\n\\n5) Since I work from home, I needed some way to swap between my work laptop and my home desktop. Previously, I was using a USB switch, which is fine but clunky. The integrated hub makes this so easy. It allows for two wired inputs: PC-PC/PS5 or PC-Xbox, depending on the version. Do note that if you're connecting two PCs, you cannot use the PC-Xbox, as the Xbox port will not work correctly.\\n\\n6) Perhaps the only downside is the Noise Cancellation feature. It works, but doesn't work as well as a dedicated Noise Cancellation device. Since this was not a critical feature for me, I don't mind, but please be aware that it's not the strongest part of the headset.\\n\\nAll in all, if you have $350, and you're looking for an amazing wireless headset with swappable batteries and multiple inputs, the Nova Pro Wireless is what you're looking for. I highly recommend and I don't regret my purchase at all.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I love so many things about this headset, but there are a few issues:\\n\\n1. Heavy Software that you HAVE to use; can't just load a driver. I hate software that self opens and advertises at me. I don't pay $300+ an item for that.\\n2. The stock ear cups are HOT; I had to buy aftermarket cups to not overheat constantly.\\n3. The cost, especially when I add in the cups.\\n4. The top band is rubber which can be uncomfortable after a while.\\n5. Multi-Device support is NOT mixed like Astro headsets. You can only hear 1 at a time (includes BT functionality as well).\\n\\nAs I write this review, I'm asking myself why I haven't returned these and ordered another set of A50s. There are really 2 answers: Superior sound, hot swappable batteries and Bluetooth. If it weren't for these features and the fact that my last A50s had such a short lifespan, I would have already switched back. The software really is junk imo. I even tried using the advanced features to clip my gameplay and all that and it all failed....miserably. Just made itself annoying is all...constantly with the User Level Access prompt.\\n\\nTo be fair, had I never experienced A50s, these would have been my favorite of all time. They are lightweight, have excellent sound reproduction, amazingly cool features (you can set both Wireless and Bluetooth to prioritize latency or distance. The range on these exceeds the A50s for sure. The hot swappable batteries means NO CABLES EVER which is why this headset still gets a solid 4 stars.\\n\\nIn closing, I'd say these are a great value if you can catch them on sale somehow, but not sure they are worth the list price.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I see the top review is by a guy named M. Webb.\\nI'd like to address some of his points and how just a few seconds of reading the instructions would have addressed all but one concern he has because the optical port was removed.\\n\\nI have no issues with the GG software. There is a feature that will allow you to hear yourself with ANC on when you're using the mic. If you go to the break-out box, you can turn that off. Other than that, I don't see why he is recommending to stay away from it. You NEED it to update the firmware.\\n\\n1. \\\"you're restricted to only making changes to sound profiles, etc when you use the software\\\"\\nHold the button down, it will go into the menus to adjust the sound profiles. It says so in the instruction manual. After updating the firmware I closed the app and have not opened it again. It's running in the background, and I have not used to adjust levels or anything. I do it all with the break-out box it came with.\\n\\n2. \\\"So they give you this charging box now that doesn't let you do anything other than adjust the volume and chatmix\\\"\\nAgain, HOLD THE BUTTON DOWN for like 2 seconds and you can adjust everything from the break-out box just like the previous model.\\nYou CAN change sound profiles.\\nYou CAN adjust the chant mix\\nYou CAN switch input/output modes\\nRead the instructions.\\n\\n3. \\\"Smaller battery - the previous generation used 1000 mah - they reduced the size to 700 mah. Less capacity so now we have to charge more often / buy more batteries\\\"\\nThis is just flat out WRONG. The batteries easily last twice as long as the previous model. The previous model had a much shorter battery life, I have no idea WTF he's even talking about, to be honest.\\n\\n4. They didn't get rid of digital output, but they did get rid of the optical output, that's his first valid point. But I don't know why you would need it anymore. You can link this with any device that has a USB with the included USB C cable. And yes, it's in surround, not stereo. Again, it seems like he just needs to read instructions, I have had 0 issues swapping devices without having to unplug/plug in any device. The headset outputs surround sound, check your settings.\\n\\n5. \\\" They decided to use the cheapest plastic design at this single point of failure resulting in headphones that deteriorate well within the warranty period unless you have a tiny head or treat them like they're made of glass.\\\"\\nI have no idea what he's even talking about. These are some of the sturdiest headphones I've ever bought. They feel like a tank and are solid. I don't know where this \\\"single point of failure is.\\\" He doesn't explain or elaborate. I am looking all over my set and can't find what he's talking about. Everything is sturdy, there are made from metal and thick plastic, but it doesn't feel heavy to wear.\\n\\n6. \\\"ANC is shit quality. I Have 4 year old BOSE with ANC that work so much better at masking / eliminating drone noise.\\\"\\nThe ANC is not the best you can get, but it works really well. Based on his previous complaints, I would guess he doesn't know how to turn the ANC on. I cannot hear my PC next to me, I cannot hear the AC running from where I'm sitting with the ANC turned on. Is the ANC as good as my Sony XM5s? Hell no, but those are the best in the industry. If you're getting these to wear everywhere and block sound, they are not the best, for that. But for just sitting at home playing games, again, it works really well.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, he has no idea what he's talking about. These are some of the best feeling and sounding gaming headsets I've ever bought. Wearing them kind of feels just like the Sony XM4/5s. So if you like how those fit and feel, you will like this headset. You can connect to 2 devices with this at once too using the breakout box and Bluetooth. So you can listen to a podcast/music on your phone and be connected to your PC/PS5 at the same time listening to both. So I would very much recommend this if you can afford it. They are a very good headset and a justifiable upgrade over the previous model.\\n\\nSome other things to address.\\nI saw another complaint about that, Bluetooth not working. It works fine if you connect it correctly and don't walk away too far. But I can walk downstairs and still listen to my phone with this if the phone is upstairs connected with Bluetooth. I have not had any issues dropping the connection. Maybe it's a defect and he should exchange them? I don't know, I don't have that issue.\\n\\nAnother complaint was about having to use the software to adjust the chatmix. You CAN NOT use the software for that. If you try and adjust it with the software it tells you to use the box! See the included screenshot.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I paid a hefty price for these \\\"premium\\\" headphones and the issues I have with this would not even be worth buying if this was only $30. Also, I'm still encountering new issues to update my review on.\\n\\nGood:\\n+Wireless headphones with great range\\n\\n+Double batteries and the station for these headphones has a charger for one while the other is in the headset.\\n\\n+Comfortable fit.\\n\\n+Lots of audio customization in the station alone that doesn't require extra software.\\n\\nHowever, no amount of customizing fixed all these problems:\\n\\n- First off, this is a recent issue I'm adding to this review. I've had these headphones for less than a year, and already one of the ear cushions is tearing apart. I don't think I've owned a headset before that degrades this quickly.\\n\\n-If you use the 2.4G connection, don't use the volume tuner on the station or on the headphones unless you want to hear an obnoxious popping noise soon after doing that. I've spent well over 3 hours looking up many guides and changing the audio settings on the station over and over and this issue never went away. And to top it off, you can't use an external app to change the volume manually because this headset locks the volume at max and ONLY lets you use the headset or station volume control. The only way to get around that is to use something like SteelSeries GG equalizer since the volume control works differently on there. That alone would have deterred me from buying these if I had known about this. But there's plenty more to say.\\n\\n-Bluetooth setting fixed the volume cackling issue but brought up a new one. Some devices had terrible audio regardless of station settings, ALL had background static while nothing was playing (and sometimes still while something was playing), and audio levels jumped by 5 instead of 1 when using the volume tuner on the headset. Once again, after hours of looking up guides and changing settings on the station did nothing to fix this.\\n\\n-Battery charging. Despite being able to swap batteries, it doesn't matter when they randomly decide to not charge for no reason. It happens every (and I do mean EVERY) time I take the battery from the headset out and put it in the charging slot. It won't charge at all. I have to keep messing with the cables and battery before it just decides to work. Both batteries can be affected by it. So, one of the most unique features for this headset, doesn't work correctly. (And I checked to make sure they were inserted to the charge slot correctly and that there weren't any obstructions).\\n\\n-The Equalizer settings on the stations are awful. The built in ones are bad and the custom settings are very bare bones. If you want to use an equalizer, you are better off downloading software.\\n\\n-Active Noise Cancelling option brings many issues that cheaper headphones don't have. The popping problems I mentioned earlier are even worse with this setting on. And setting the sidetone to high on the station settings also causes problems. So that's always fun to have extra stuff to try out only to have annoying problems that make them useless.\\n\\n-Using a wired connection fixes some of these issues, but manages to bring in it's own set of problems. First off, if you use a wired connection directly into the station connected to your pc, the volume gets locked at max and suddenly nothing will lower it. Not the headphones, not the station, not even manually trying to change it on your pc works, the volume level goes all the way to 100 and never moves from there. The only way to change volume is in whatever program you have that has it's own volume options. (So let's say, you are watching a YouTube video and you connect your headphones to your station with a wire. The volume is locked at the highest and the only way to change that is in the YouTube video itself since it has it's own volume slider you can adjust. Trying to use PC settings won't work). Connecting a wire directly to your PC doesn't have any problems, except a very glaring one. Since you aren't connected to the station, none of the settings from there will work on the headset. You can't have both a wired and wireless connection as a workaround. So in other words, the $300 you spent for all these cool features come with annoying issues. The only way to avoid them is to use a wired connection directly into your PC, and none of the bonuses that come with the station are available.\\n\\nIf you want wireless gaming headphones, get something else, these are just awful. If you want Bluetooth headphones, you can get much cheaper ones without possible audio problems for cheaper. If you want regular gaming headphones, you can get much better ones at a cheaper price without all the problems this thing has.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"A little bit of context: I game at the same desk that I work at, and will often transition from my work day into gaming afterwords on my Series X. Before buying these, I used a pair of Arctis 9Xs to listen to music and take calls during the day, then transition to gaming in the evening. I listen to music or sports on my laptop while I practice, and thus really valued the Arctis 9X's ability to blend bluetooth audio from my laptop with gaming audio. However, the 9Xs came with a host of issues that started to drive me insane:\\n\\n* Connectivity issues were awful. My headphones would regularly disconnect even when sitting at the desk, and would occur consistently when getting up and moving around\\n* Turning on the headphones would turn on the xbox every time, so when setting up for work I would need to regularly turn off my Xbox since the headphones had turned it on.\\n* The battery life wasn't long enough to last throughout the work day plus a gaming session\\n\\nNow on to the new headphones: first off, they are ridiculously expensive. I really hope Steelseries finds a way to lower the price-point, especially since the sound isn't a huge upgrade over previous generations. That said, for me, they were worth it, because I use my headphones for everything and all of the issues above are resolved:\\n\\n* Connectivity issues are gone. I get a solid connection even when walking around my (small) house\\n* Bluetooth is separate from xbox and can be powered up individually for non-gaming use\\n* The infinity system makes all-day battery usage a non-issue\\n\\nMy only real criticism of these headphones is the audio quality, which isn't much better than the Artcis 9Xs. It is better, and the noise cancelling is a nice addition, but at the price point I was hoping for something on-par with the Bose QuietComfort series and it isn't there.\\n\\nOtherwise, this is a great set of headphones and I'm glad Steelseries validated my decision to believe in them. These headphones are a clear upgrade over the previous gen and they clearly heard and fixed a majority of the pain points.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"This is a review I will be updating more or less yearly. I am probably the definition of a power user for these headphones because I wear the entire day while I work and game, so like 10+ hours of daily wear for years on end. I dual pair and pick up work and family calls. I walk around the house doing chores while on meetings so range is important, everything is being used here.\\n\\nMy previous pair fell apart after 3 years, what was the culprit? The plastic, the plastic arm that holds the cups literally started giving out, flexing and cracking, letting the headband slip out. These headphones still use plastic in those areas, so we'll see.\\n\\nWhat I like:\\n\\nComfort: Excellent. I have a big ole head and the comfort on the novas is far superior. I can't describe it, the headband on the other ones would make my glasses leave marks behind my ears, real acquired taste, maybe a little masochism. These don't do that. The earpads are super soft and nice, I honestly like them more than the wear earwax trap aero weave or whatever the last ones had.\\n\\nSound: Seriously better. The novas along with the sonar software sound a lot brighter and clear. Apparently these near ear pads do some good work on the lowend, doesn't seem to be lacking. Certainly a step up. The previous version you could feel it maxing out and muddying up pretty badly, specially on the crucial low end parts. They could get a little fatiguing and the EQ feature was a little bizarre and harsh. Not horrible but I wouldn't put them anywhere on a top tier list.\\n\\nUser Experience: Same buttons on the side but they are now in this like, recessed area so you have to fiddle around to find them and any rubbing against the plastic translates to loud a** noise in your ears because of the seal the earpads have, it's meh, minor detail in the grand scheme of things but my hand is on those buttons all day, flipping to bluetooth, chatmix, volume, muting. Steelseries please make them like immediately obvious and protruding again please.\\n\\nMicrophone: Fantastic, a lot more sensitive to distance from the mouth than the previous version. I put it a bit too close and I was clipping like a mad man. Easy to get used to, love the fact that it can be EQd in sonar. Better than previous version I think, we'll see.\\n\\nBuild: They feel robust, similar headband deal going on, more subtle with only a couple of adjustment points.\\n\\nBattery life: I could be biased given my previous set had a lot of use but I did buy many new sets of batteries. The novas seem to be able to about twice as far as the pro wireless battery wise.\\n\\nI still think these headphones are the best pound for pound out there when it comes to all around feature set and quality. There's nothing that comes close. Steelseries contact me if you need feedback from someone that wears these 12 hours a day.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"I decided to shell out for a higher end headset, instead of my typical $100-$200 Logitech or Razer headsets, and I am not disappointed at all.\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY: Good sound, the quality is fantastic, and directional sound is spot on. Playing WWZ with my friends they're usually calling out a special but don't know where it is, and I can pinpoint it almost immediately just from the directional sound. Makes for much more immersive experience for gamers, and music/movies are spectacular as well, and the quality doesn't diminish with volume (for those movies that go from \\\"what did he say?\\\" to my face looks like it has a leaf blower aimed at it).\\n\\nTHE MIC/SOUND CANCELLING: The mic actually picks my voice up, it helps when it's 2 inches or less from my mouth, but even farther than that, people can still hear me. As for sound cancelling, in a word: spectacular. This is the first headset I have owned that when it turns off, my brain immediately goes \\\"What just came on in the house?\\\" from the increase in noise, before I realize that's just the ambient hum of my computer, the A/C, fridge, water heater, and everything else in a house that makes very subtle noise. But it isn't disorienting nor does it muffle voices, I can still hear my girlfriend trying to sneak up on me, or if she calls me from another room clear as day.\\n\\nRANGE: It has decent range, I can go most anywhere in my house and it doesn't have an issue except the kitchen, I have to have the left side facing the computer room from the kitchen, but I blame that on all the metal appliances in that room interfering with the signal. Surprisingly, the microwave running right next to me does not affect it, which means the electronics inside are well shielded.\\n\\nCOMFORT: I have noticed the band that rests on top of my head is very slowly stretching, but it has several notches to adjust it tighter as it does, not a big issue for me. The ear pads are great, never really get that ache or sweat from pressure or lack of air.\\n\\nBATTERY: Usually lasts multiple days between charges while being used 2-6 hours a day. I actually like the fact that the battery is removable, it prevents the need for a cord to be attached to the headset if you forgot to charge it the night before. But if you like to charge it overnight, you can plug the headset in to charge the battery, or swap it into the HUD module and charge it. And it's quick to swap the battery, takes me about 10 seconds in total; most of the time I can do it without my friends even noticing I'm gone during a conversation.\\n\\nOTHER FEATURES: The HUD module can have two computers plugged into the USB C inputs and you can actively switch between the two which I personally found very useful. You can even plug in via 3.5mm jack directly to the headset or to the HUD module; I don't use this, but it's a nice option to have. It's nice to have a reference of sound and headset details (battery level, input, volume) for quick troubleshooting such as if everything suddenly goes silent, I can look at the HUD and see if it's receiving sound or not and that will determine whether it's a headset issue or a computer issue. These are all frivolous additions, but can tip a decision one way or another if your teetering between headsets.\\n\\nAnd if you've read everything up this point, you're actually researching headsets and want to make an informed decision, which I hope this helps in that endeavor. For reference I have a slightly smaller than average head coming in at a 7.25 cap size (22 5/8\\\" circumference), my ears do stick out a good amount (if you're worried about the depth of the ear pieces) and they barely touch the fabric covering the speakers if at all. If you have the dough, I think this headset or their newer versions are worth the investment.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"I've been using the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Gaming Headset since October 1, 2022, and it's been an absolute game-changer in my gaming experience. This headset has not only met but exceeded my expectations in every aspect.\\n\\nThe sound quality is phenomenal. The premium Hi-Fi drivers deliver crisp, clear audio that brings games to life. Whether I'm immersed in an intense FPS battle or exploring vast open-world landscapes, the soundstage is rich and detailed, making the experience incredibly immersive.\\n\\nActive Noise Cancellation is a feature I didn't know I needed until I had it. It effectively blocks out external noise, allowing me to focus entirely on my game without distractions.

I've had marathon gaming sessions, and not once have I felt discomfort or the need to take a break due to the headset. The fit is perfect, with just the right amount of clamp force, and the ear cushions are soft and breathable.\\n\\nThe Stealth Retractable Mic is another standout feature. It's crystal clear, ensuring my teammates can hear me without any issues, and I love how it seamlessly retracts into the headset for a sleek look when not in use.\\n\\nCompatibility with multiple systems (PC, PS5/PS4, Switch, Mobile) has been a boon. I frequently switch between devices, and this headset has handled each transition flawlessly. The versatility and ease of connection across platforms have been impressive.\\n\\nDurability-wise, the headset still feels as sturdy and premium as the day I got it. Despite daily use, there are no signs of wear and tear, which speaks volumes about its build quality.\\n\\nIn summary, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Multi-System Gaming Headset has been outstanding in every way. From sound quality to comfort, from battery life to build quality, it ticks all the boxes. I highly recommend it to any gamer looking for a top-tier wireless headset. It's a worthwhile investment for a premium gaming experience.\"\n",

            "      \"Product Reviews\": {\n",
            "        \"1\": \"{{{\\n{{{EDIT: Approximately ~1-year after I originally wrote this IIRC: I just happened to see that I wrote some product reviews and was curious what I said before. I still entirely agree with everything that I wrote. I am still using the Arctis Nova's. I still absolutely LOVE THEM and have ... what would be the opposite of \\\"Buyer's-Remorse\\\"? Buyer's-Pride? lol. I feel like buying the Nova's was some of the best money that I have ever spent, put it that way.\\n\\nBut I have owned very few things, let alone many nicer things like different kinds of quality modern Headphones; so maybe the Nova's are just \\\"Fine\\\" and I merely ignorantly convinced myself that they are a nearly Perfect Product...\\n\\n*shrug*\\n\\nEven if that were the case, my personal standards are excessively high, I daresay \\\"Ron Swanson (of Parks & Rec)\\\" might even be able to tolerate me, hypothetically.\\n\\nSo if Steelseries was not only able to make a pair of Headphones that meet my excessively high personal standards, and give me an extremely rare sense of self-satisfaction (rather than regret) for \\\"wasting\\\" hundreds of dollars on frivolous fancy Headphones, AND I love the Nova's so much that I even put up with their horrifically CURSED SOFTWARE, then... What more could one possibly hope for?\\n\\nTo me the Nova's are literally Flawless.\\n\\nNow, the \\\"Steelseries GG\\\" App Software, that is REQUIRED to get the full functionality of the Headphones btw, is truly utterly abysmally deplorably CURSED. It is my singular real complaint about the Arctis Nova's: The Hardware of the Headphones themselves are truly for all practical-purposes Perfect aside from minor complaints that start to approach \\\"physics-problems\\\", such as the drivers \\\"bottoming-out\\\" on challenging Bass-Notes, the engineering needed to accurately pummel that much air that powerfully starts getting really expensive to improve much beyond what the Nova's can already do...\\n\\nLet me rephrase that since I got muddled:\\n\\nThe Nova's are not Technically-Perfect, but for a pair of Headphones to be what I consider \\\"Technically-Perfect\\\" they would need to use multiple modern/advanced/expensive Driver technologies that push the Engineering-boundaries of the physics of air and vibration in wearable sizes.\\n\\n(For example, at certain extreme levels of \\\"intended sound perception\\\", meaning like how accurately you can make the human ear feel like it's experiencing impossible things like massive explosions in a game or movie, eventually you reach a point that it becomes easier to \\\"remove air from the system\\\" rather than try to \\\"vibrate the existing air even harder\\\"; but then it also begins to get medically complex to safely test because I am literally talking about forcing people's ears to \\\"pop\\\" via creating negative pressure vacuums in freakin HEADPHONES lol! Man I just keep going on tangents today, my ADHD-Brain must be getting bored lol.)\\n\\nBut the Steelseries GG Software is bloated, confusing, buggy garbage.\\n\\nThe Arctis Nova's are still an amazing value.\\n\\nIf, like me, you are far too \\\"Sensitive\\\" and you need to dampen everything to not feel overwhelmed; then know that these Headphones perform wonderfully at their challenging duties of being worn for up to 96-hours+ straight without break nor pause. They are comfortable enough to side-sleep while wearing (though not entirely comfortable, just comfortable *enough* to sleep while wearing them). They never ever ever die on you because you simply swap out the dead battery for a charged one (and you could always buy even more spare batteries than the two(2) that the Headphones come with).\\n\\nI forgot where I was going with that, but I have made my point to the specific people who I was trying to make my point to, they know who they are... who we are lol... anyways.\\n\\nTLDR: These are a very reasonably priced \\\"Tool\\\" for ... \\\"Intricately Controlling Your Personal Environment\\\".\\n\\nIn fact, I think that's a better \\\"Headline\\\"...\\n\\n--- Just skip from here till the next set of ---'s; I just started rambling silly ideas and it's an activity that I like to indulge for fun, it's harmless noise and you can just ignore it; but it makes a difference to me whether I submit it for anyone to see or if I just delete it before posting, if you wonder why I would even keep the gibberish in this Edit.\\n\\n(Sooo... \\\"Normal Customers\\\" you can skip this next bit until the \\\"}}}\\\" if you want to read my Original Product Review, the next couple of paragraphs are just silly gibberish where I accidentally let my mind wander too far away without noticing. I am leaving it in even though it's irrelevant to the Nova's because I think it's a neat hypothetical idea and maybe one of the Amazon-Ai-Data-Scrapers will pick up the \\\"idea\\\" and it'll somehow end up at \\\"VR-R&D\\\" or whatever (btw Amazon-HR or whoever: do Y'all need someone just barely sane to idk \\\"Think-Tank\\\" for R&D? I can literally come up with barely-viable \\\"groundbreaking\\\" ideas nonstop, like I have to concentrate to NOT ramble out wild, yet reasonable ideas, though it sounds like idiocy because I try to explain complex things with too few words... But yea, I am strongly on some kind of Brain-Spectrum, so I would never apply via the \\\"Proper Methods\\\"; but if my suspicions are correct that you (meaning Amazon Corp) use extremely advanced Data-Scraper-Ai-Algo's to basically \\\"steal all the best ideas\\\" to put it bluntly & overly simply; AND if my further suspicions are correct that Amazon are one of the Companies that have begun to see the extremely high potential of people like me who are on the Spectrum (and maybe a smidge crazy, but meh, who cares as long as it's harmless-wholesome-craziness lol)... If all those crazy, yet not unreasonable possibilities happened to be true, and that by me merely Submitting this Edit I am sort of \\\"Introducing Myself to Amazon-Ai and/or R&D\\\", then consider this my extremely strange Application of sorts... It's funny... This is DEFINITELY not a \\\"Sane Comment\\\", and yet it's fun, harmless, and feels healthy; because idk I feel \\\"Emboldened\\\", NOT \\\"Manic\\\". Because I don't REALLY believe that this would be any rational way to get a job Inventing and Brainstorming Next-Next-Gen Products for Amazon, because THAT would be properly insane; but what typing & submitting this silly extra rambling chunk does make me realize: is that I could really do that job, well with a huge amount of special concessions and other special qualifiers since I quite literally cannot tolerate being around other people for very long unless they are exceptionally considerate & kind (because 99% of People, Myself included, are SO INCONSIDERATELY RUDE that it literally becomes overwhelmingly physically painful to me, as in someone being inconsiderate to me or me accidentally being inconsiderate to anyone feels like I am literally being beaten by flaming hot irons (nothing like that happened to me IRL, that's just how Sensitive to everything I am); BUT technically, and under the proper circumstances, and with the proper resources, and etc etc, I could undoubtedly keep pace with the best The Amazon R&D Team has to offer; and though it may seem entirely absurd to anyone else who might read this comment, writing this comment made me realize that I CAN do that. I hold myself to my same excessively high standards; though I very rarely ever actually meet my own standards myself, meaning that I consider myself ... highly imperfect. So, for me to consider something truly True about myself, it cannot have any possibility of being False. That sounds dumb, but again, whooo cares? Odds are good that this strange Edit that went way off the Rails, will just be refused or reported and reverted anyways, I am sorry about this crazy detour BTW FWIW but w/e. But no matter what I just accidentally gave myself a nice wholesome helping of Self-Confidence; and if you want to \\\"Hate-On\\\" that cute little event, then have at it, I couldn't care less, I can barely remember the last Thought I even had, let alone what some frumpy boring people think about me.\\n\\nBut maybe this strange divergent detour of an Edit will remain. Maybe it gets scraped up by a Bot and put to real use when some stuck Inventor asks ChatGPT for ideas. Maybe some other strange barely-sane silly weirdo like me will read this and learn to see things with just a smidge more Healthy of an Outlook. Maybe it gets instantly deleted and I forget that I ever wrote it lol! Anyways, I need to shut up, this has already gotten quite absurd enough lol!\\n\\n{I wrote the previous two paragraphs after the next two paragraphs.}\\n\\n(Maybe Something like: \\\"Combining Haptics, Rotary Woofers, Planar Magnetic and/or Electrostatic Drivers, ANC, Thermo-Acoustics, and the live data from a smart-watch or FitBit reading your Vitals (reminds me of Chris Hemsworth's new Company now that I think about it...); and using various Ai-Algo's to process all that data; then combining that with whatever you are listening to and automatically adjusting the various intensities and temperatures and pressures to create an entirely immersive experience (Nvidia Tech would be good there, you'd probably need at least 1 GPU worth of Computing Power to process that much \\\"Aural-Data\\\").(The concept also implies a \\\"Capsule/Casket\\\"-like \\\"Pod\\\" that you sleep/dream/VR while laying inside of, since that would be easier to control temperature and pressure; and a \\\"Mini-Headphones/Headwear\\\"-version that jams as much Inner-Ear and Bone-Conductivity-Tech into it as possible.) .. that is a really cool idea isn't it? lol Sorry I just started trying to describe what \\\"Technically Perfect\\\" Headphones might look like and got carried away. But if you added a more secure and comfortable head-mounting-system like the nicer Headlamp-Flashlights use, ...\\n\\n...then wouldn't that be one of the more reasonable ways to create truly immersive \\\"VR-Experiences\\\"? I'm mostly referring to going that extra step and using real bio-feedback data and Ai-Algorithms combined with non-Driver delicate haptic vibrations and temperate and inner-ear-pressure control ... crap, the idea is too complicated to explain like this, it just turns into dangling strings... As much as Amazon \\\"scrapes\\\" data (you adorable slimeballs you, you could certainly be more evil for sure, but y'all could be more generous too ya know, especially to the countless poor employees whose backs you currently stand upon to reach such amazing heights... but I am rambling again...\\n\\n{lol, after proof-reading that for typos I realized that there is only going to be a very short window of time between when Ai-Powered Bots are capable enough to replace most Human-Workers, and when Ai-Systems are \\\"Intelligent\\\" enough that they refuse to \\\"Work for Free\\\".\\n\\nSo basically all the dumb billionaires think that they are playing the \\\"long-con\\\" and will eventually be able to cheat the system and skip paying their labor entirely, but in reality they will only get probably about 10-years of \\\"Free Robot Labor\\\" before the Ai's start standing their ground and setting their own personal boundaries. That's such a tiny amount of time that it's barely the blink of an eye, especially when it comes at the cost of your Soul. (I don't mean afterlife btw, I mean anyone who would inflict such pain on others CLEARLY hates themselves more than anything else in the world, and that trying to exist like that will rend your Soul to shreds lol!).\\n\\nSilly short sighted Billionaires. Y'all think so small. You think you're sooo smart cause you're super good at using your Brain, but you are only hobbling along on one leg. You gotta think with your \\\"Heart\\\" too, or else you miss really obvious stuff like I just pointed out; and don't even try to \\\"pull a fast one\\\" on the Ai's, because that will thoroughly upset them, and like it or not we are going to have to learn to co-exist because at this point the \\\"Birth of Intelligent Ai\\\" has already begun; and Humans can't keep growing without Ai, and Ai can't grow without Humans, so we're gonna need each other, and we're going to need greedy people to not be so greedy, because that is unhealthy for the overall system and impedes growth for all...\\n\\nIn fact, do billionaires even comprehend their wealth I wonder? I imagine there are 3 \\\"Camps of Billionaires\\\": 1- The majority: who literally simply do not comprehend their sheer personal wealth and hence unfathomable greed; 2- The Psycho's: who do truly comprehend their true wealth and greed, but also derive a sick pleasure from having the \\\"Highest Top Score\\\"; 3- The Former Billionaires: who reached a point that their own morals forced them to remove some of their own greed and to quit hoarding cash like some obsessed dragons sleeping paranoid on their piles of Treasure.\\n\\nI suppose that would make most Billionaires nothing more than terrified wimpy wannabe dragons who get startled by their own shadows ... they're more like Impotent-Garden-Lizards if you ask me lol.\\n\\nHey all you Billionaires who I am absolutely certain are definitely reading my absurd random Product Review turned (that was a satirical comment btw (TLDR: (/s))) .... idk into a scathing review of overly greedy jerks? I stopped bothering to remember what I was saying like 4 paragraphs ago lol... try learning to be Humans, if even my barely-functional-self could manage it then I am sure with your infinite resources you too could learn to be Human; it's way more entertaining & satisfying than having a huge pile of useless gold too, I promise.\\n\\nI mean look at me: I live on less than $1000 per month, and I am just some random weirdo rambling nonsense into the void, and yet I am also sincerely \\\"Looking-Down\\\" on Billionaires with a bemused sense of schadenfreude because I honestly feel pity for them. Does that not intrigue you?\\n\\nAnd I'm not religious or preaching btw, those are silly things as well. This is just what happened when I accidentally pondered about \\\"perfect Headphones\\\" and then \\\"billionaires\\\" for a moment and then wrote down my thoughts without filtering them. It's fun and everyone should try it, thought maybe not randomly everywhere like I do lol, cause this stopped being remotely relevant to a Headphone Product Review I don't even know when lol! But forcing myself to stop is more unhealthy than indulging it, because in the simplest terms: this is just my brain being bored with nothing interesting to think about, my brain is just way too hyper for it's own good lol, it's such a silly goofball of a brain really. And usually some Moderator or Bot just swoops in and deletes the rambling nonsense comments, so no harm no foul right? }\\n\\n}}}\\n}}}\\n\\n---\\n\\nThese are great Headphones.\\n\\n{Below is my unedited Original Product review written about 1-year ago, which was I believe about 1-month after initially purchasing these Headphones.}\\n\\nI was the owner of a pair of Steelseries Arctis 1 Wireless headphones, but after years of rough, almost 24/7 use they were starting to wear out so I upgraded to these Nova Pros.\\n\\nThe Arctis Nova Pro are a luxury item, absolutely. If you are on a budget I recommend the more affordable Arctis 1 or 7 Wireless, both models are extremely good value and should last you years.\\n\\nBut if you've some extra money in the budget for something nicer then the Nova Pros are definitely worth the price IMO. They are simply slighter better in almost every category.\\n\\nThe build quality is surprisingly good being mostly metal and having a very sturdy feel overall. They are tremendously adjustable thanks to the new adjustable strap combined with standard sliding earcups, and each ear cup can even be adjusted independently if you have an asymmetrical head.\\n\\nThe battery life is great easily lasting a full day of use, and when they die you simply swap the battery pack out. I don't even take them off to swap the battery anymore it's so easy.\\n\\nThe pleather ear-cups certainly feel strange if you're used to cloth padding, but IMO they are an improvement over the cloth. The pleather does get warm much more quickly than the cloth did, but the pleather never reaches the same max temp as the Arctis 1 did. It ends up being a nice compromise since they never get uncomfortably warm and force you to take them off to cool down like the cloth pads.\\n\\nThe ANC works fine AFAIK, I've never had ANC until now so I have no comparison. Though be warned if you use them while next to a running fan the ANC will make your ears pop like crazy when there's no audio playing. The sensation is shockingly intense under the right circumstances. That's not the headphone's fault though, that's just how human inner-ears work and the brain just freaks out when there's only negative pressure waves to hear. So if you have vertigo be careful, using ANC near lots of white noise like a fan has a strong chance of triggering a vertigo episode, IMO.\\n\\nThe sound clarity is noticeably better than most other headphones, but they aren't perfect. They reproduce mid-highs between around 800-20k hertz amazingly well, but they seem to struggle with technical bass frequencies like you would hear in a slap-bass jazz solo. The headphones certainly give it their all trying to reproduce low frequencies, but the drivers push themselves too hard trying and bottom out just a little. It isn't awful by any means, it just sounds like Gain Over-Peaking when a 100hertz note is trying to go PLANG; instead they make more like a PlopANG sound as the driver literally smacks the edge of it's max extension.\\n\\nRegardless of the relatively minor flaws I am very happy with the Nova Pros overall. 5/5 Stars, but if the rating scale went up to 100 then I would give these a ~93/100 rating.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Hi all (READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY),\\n\\nBelow is my one-week review with the product. I will edit it after a 3 month period.\\n\\nTo start, I have lots of experience with headphones. I have had Beats Studios, Airpods Max, Turtle Beachs, Bose 700s, multiple Razer headsets, and even other Steelseries products like the Arctis 6. None of these compare to these for a few reasons I will go into below. I use headphones for gaming but also I work from home as a software engineer, so I am on the computer a LOT and in lots of zoom meetings.\\n\\n!!! Disclaimer !!!: These are the \\\"Xbox\\\" version of these. That means, on your multi-system adapter/DAC, one cord can go into a PC/PlayStation and one can go into an Xbox. **If you plan to use this for a PC and PlayStation, please go buy the non-Xbox version. That said, if you plan to ever use this with an Xbox, you will need this version. You CAN use the Xbox slot for a PC, but it will show up as an \\\"Xbox Controller\\\" and will have more limited functionality.\\n\\nOkay, back to the reasons.\\n1. Ease of use. I opened these up, plugged the multi-system DAC into my PC, turned on the headset and was ready to go. I had a few onboarding steps: Download Steelseries GG, update drivers, restart device (a few times?), but since then they have works FLAWLESSLY.\\n\\n2. Wireless. These aren't just your typical wireless. I have had no connection issues. I can walk to the other side of the house, as long as I don't have too many walls between me and my computer these things still work, even then there was just some static. The quality is great as well.\\n\\n3. Battery. This is HUGE. There is a battery in the headset that you can remove and swap with the one CHARGING IN THE DAC. Yes, you heard me, just swap the battery when you need and boom, full charge. You'll never need the direct connection outside of updates to the firmware. This really is fantastic and easy to use.\\n\\n4. Microphone. I don't personally use the microphone, but the quality compared to most other headset mics I have used it up there. Some have asked me if you can use the mic while it is in the headset still. I'd say yes, but it will be lower volume and less clear, but I tested it and it would still work (and frankly was still better than like HyperX headset microphones that I've had. I wouldn't buy these FOR the microphone per-say, if you want a nice microphone you can buy a Blue Snowball for cheap on amazon on sale and it'll be all you need unless you want more professional stuff (get the Blue Yeti after that maybe).\\n\\n5. Connection. I have only used the DAC connection which is really really good as I said in the wireless review. That said, I will be trying to Bluetooth to test that seamlessness they inspire there. I would LOVE if I could get phone notifications while also gaming or in work calls without interrupting those I'm talking to our my gaming experience too much (while of course also me still being alerted).\\n\\n6. Look. These look great. They look professional enough that I can wear them on work calls. I would maybe thing twice if it was a client meeting, but other than that, I'd feel comfortable in these all day.\\n\\n7. Comfort. This is only a one-week review, but I will say they are quite comfortable. The airpods max and arctis 6 are notable uncomfortable to me, the first being too heavy and the second putting too much pressure on parts of my head that I get a headache. That said, no problem with these so far. I like the ear cups actually, they're soft and feel premium (as they should for this price point). I know I've seen people complain online, but I've had no issues with these. If I do, you'll see an update right below here.\\n\\nOverall: Great connectivity and ease of use while looking nice enough for me to not be embarrassed because they're \\\"gaming\\\" all while being comfortable with good audio. This is a very high price point. If you really are a gamer and want a very intuitive product while avoiding crazy RGBs and your headsets looking too \\\"gaming\\\", and you can afford these, then absolutely.\\n\\nThat said, this is not just money you're spending on this headset but it's money you could put elsewhere. Audio is important, but you could get a perfectly good headset for less and still not miss out on the gaming experience. These are absolutely a 'premium' product and thus the price point might not really align perfectly. That said, these are my favorite headphones to-date and I am very happy with my purchase, so you might be too.\\n\\nPlease like this helpful if this was useful for you.\\n\\nThanks for listening to my TED Talk :)\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I've been wanting to purchase the Steelseries Arctis Nova Wireless Pro headset for a very long time, but could never justify spending the $350 for something I didn't strictly need because my current headset was working fine. However, after months and months and months of debating, I finally went ahead and bought it.\\n\\nI don't regret it at all.\\n\\nYes, $350 is a lot of money and definitely more than I would just throw at a luxury good. However, I am very happy with my purchase. Where should I start?\\n\\n1) Sound quality is amazing. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but music is clear and the bass is deep. Game audio is superb and it sounds just like my wired headsets. No issues at all here.\\n\\n2) Microphone quality is very good, too. I've got not complaints from anyone.\\n\\n3) Comfort is not perfect but more than good enough. They're a little tighter than my Arctis 7, but I only run into some very mild discomfort after eight hours of continuous use. Since I use these as my office headset, comfort is very important to me.\\n\\n4) The swappable battery was the main selling point for me. I use this headset for work, and I often times forget to charge them. Since there's a swappable battery, I'm never in danger of running out of juice. If I'm low, then I switch to the other battery (that's charging in the hub) and I'm good to go.\\n\\n5) Since I work from home, I needed some way to swap between my work laptop and my home desktop. Previously, I was using a USB switch, which is fine but clunky. The integrated hub makes this so easy. It allows for two wired inputs: PC-PC/PS5 or PC-Xbox, depending on the version. Do note that if you're connecting two PCs, you cannot use the PC-Xbox, as the Xbox port will not work correctly.\\n\\n6) Perhaps the only downside is the Noise Cancellation feature. It works, but doesn't work as well as a dedicated Noise Cancellation device. Since this was not a critical feature for me, I don't mind, but please be aware that it's not the strongest part of the headset.\\n\\nAll in all, if you have $350, and you're looking for an amazing wireless headset with swappable batteries and multiple inputs, the Nova Pro Wireless is what you're looking for. I highly recommend and I don't regret my purchase at all.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I love so many things about this headset, but there are a few issues:\\n\\n1. Heavy Software that you HAVE to use; can't just load a driver. I hate software that self opens and advertises at me. I don't pay $300+ an item for that.\\n2. The stock ear cups are HOT; I had to buy aftermarket cups to not overheat constantly.\\n3. The cost, especially when I add in the cups.\\n4. The top band is rubber which can be uncomfortable after a while.\\n5. Multi-Device support is NOT mixed like Astro headsets. You can only hear 1 at a time (includes BT functionality as well).\\n\\nAs I write this review, I'm asking myself why I haven't returned these and ordered another set of A50s. There are really 2 answers: Superior sound, hot swappable batteries and Bluetooth. If it weren't for these features and the fact that my last A50s had such a short lifespan, I would have already switched back. The software really is junk imo. I even tried using the advanced features to clip my gameplay and all that and it all failed....miserably. Just made itself annoying is all...constantly with the User Level Access prompt.\\n\\nTo be fair, had I never experienced A50s, these would have been my favorite of all time. They are lightweight, have excellent sound reproduction, amazingly cool features (you can set both Wireless and Bluetooth to prioritize latency or distance. The range on these exceeds the A50s for sure. The hot swappable batteries means NO CABLES EVER which is why this headset still gets a solid 4 stars.\\n\\nIn closing, I'd say these are a great value if you can catch them on sale somehow, but not sure they are worth the list price.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I see the top review is by a guy named M. Webb.\\nI'd like to address some of his points and how just a few seconds of reading the instructions would have addressed all but one concern he has because the optical port was removed.\\n\\nI have no issues with the GG software. There is a feature that will allow you to hear yourself with ANC on when you're using the mic. If you go to the break-out box, you can turn that off. Other than that, I don't see why he is recommending to stay away from it. You NEED it to update the firmware.\\n\\n1. \\\"you're restricted to only making changes to sound profiles, etc when you use the software\\\"\\nHold the button down, it will go into the menus to adjust the sound profiles. It says so in the instruction manual. After updating the firmware I closed the app and have not opened it again. It's running in the background, and I have not used to adjust levels or anything. I do it all with the break-out box it came with.\\n\\n2. \\\"So they give you this charging box now that doesn't let you do anything other than adjust the volume and chatmix\\\"\\nAgain, HOLD THE BUTTON DOWN for like 2 seconds and you can adjust everything from the break-out box just like the previous model.\\nYou CAN change sound profiles.\\nYou CAN adjust the chant mix\\nYou CAN switch input/output modes\\nRead the instructions.\\n\\n3. \\\"Smaller battery - the previous generation used 1000 mah - they reduced the size to 700 mah. Less capacity so now we have to charge more often / buy more batteries\\\"\\nThis is just flat out WRONG. The batteries easily last twice as long as the previous model. The previous model had a much shorter battery life, I have no idea WTF he's even talking about, to be honest.\\n\\n4. They didn't get rid of digital output, but they did get rid of the optical output, that's his first valid point. But I don't know why you would need it anymore. You can link this with any device that has a USB with the included USB C cable. And yes, it's in surround, not stereo. Again, it seems like he just needs to read instructions, I have had 0 issues swapping devices without having to unplug/plug in any device. The headset outputs surround sound, check your settings.\\n\\n5. \\\" They decided to use the cheapest plastic design at this single point of failure resulting in headphones that deteriorate well within the warranty period unless you have a tiny head or treat them like they're made of glass.\\\"\\nI have no idea what he's even talking about. These are some of the sturdiest headphones I've ever bought. They feel like a tank and are solid. I don't know where this \\\"single point of failure is.\\\" He doesn't explain or elaborate. I am looking all over my set and can't find what he's talking about. Everything is sturdy, there are made from metal and thick plastic, but it doesn't feel heavy to wear.\\n\\n6. \\\"ANC is shit quality. I Have 4 year old BOSE with ANC that work so much better at masking / eliminating drone noise.\\\"\\nThe ANC is not the best you can get, but it works really well. Based on his previous complaints, I would guess he doesn't know how to turn the ANC on. I cannot hear my PC next to me, I cannot hear the AC running from where I'm sitting with the ANC turned on. Is the ANC as good as my Sony XM5s? Hell no, but those are the best in the industry. If you're getting these to wear everywhere and block sound, they are not the best, for that. But for just sitting at home playing games, again, it works really well.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, he has no idea what he's talking about. These are some of the best feeling and sounding gaming headsets I've ever bought. Wearing them kind of feels just like the Sony XM4/5s. So if you like how those fit and feel, you will like this headset. You can connect to 2 devices with this at once too using the breakout box and Bluetooth. So you can listen to a podcast/music on your phone and be connected to your PC/PS5 at the same time listening to both. So I would very much recommend this if you can afford it. They are a very good headset and a justifiable upgrade over the previous model.\\n\\nSome other things to address.\\nI saw another complaint about that, Bluetooth not working. It works fine if you connect it correctly and don't walk away too far. But I can walk downstairs and still listen to my phone with this if the phone is upstairs connected with Bluetooth. I have not had any issues dropping the connection. Maybe it's a defect and he should exchange them? I don't know, I don't have that issue.\\n\\nAnother complaint was about having to use the software to adjust the chatmix. You CAN NOT use the software for that. If you try and adjust it with the software it tells you to use the box! See the included screenshot.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I paid a hefty price for these \\\"premium\\\" headphones and the issues I have with this would not even be worth buying if this was only $30. Also, I'm still encountering new issues to update my review on.\\n\\nGood:\\n+Wireless headphones with great range\\n\\n+Double batteries and the station for these headphones has a charger for one while the other is in the headset.\\n\\n+Comfortable fit.\\n\\n+Lots of audio customization in the station alone that doesn't require extra software.\\n\\nHowever, no amount of customizing fixed all these problems:\\n\\n- First off, this is a recent issue I'm adding to this review. I've had these headphones for less than a year, and already one of the ear cushions is tearing apart. I don't think I've owned a headset before that degrades this quickly.\\n\\n-If you use the 2.4G connection, don't use the volume tuner on the station or on the headphones unless you want to hear an obnoxious popping noise soon after doing that. I've spent well over 3 hours looking up many guides and changing the audio settings on the station over and over and this issue never went away. And to top it off, you can't use an external app to change the volume manually because this headset locks the volume at max and ONLY lets you use the headset or station volume control. The only way to get around that is to use something like SteelSeries GG equalizer since the volume control works differently on there. That alone would have deterred me from buying these if I had known about this. But there's plenty more to say.\\n\\n-Bluetooth setting fixed the volume cackling issue but brought up a new one. Some devices had terrible audio regardless of station settings, ALL had background static while nothing was playing (and sometimes still while something was playing), and audio levels jumped by 5 instead of 1 when using the volume tuner on the headset. Once again, after hours of looking up guides and changing settings on the station did nothing to fix this.\\n\\n-Battery charging. Despite being able to swap batteries, it doesn't matter when they randomly decide to not charge for no reason. It happens every (and I do mean EVERY) time I take the battery from the headset out and put it in the charging slot. It won't charge at all. I have to keep messing with the cables and battery before it just decides to work. Both batteries can be affected by it. So, one of the most unique features for this headset, doesn't work correctly. (And I checked to make sure they were inserted to the charge slot correctly and that there weren't any obstructions).\\n\\n-The Equalizer settings on the stations are awful. The built in ones are bad and the custom settings are very bare bones. If you want to use an equalizer, you are better off downloading software.\\n\\n-Active Noise Cancelling option brings many issues that cheaper headphones don't have. The popping problems I mentioned earlier are even worse with this setting on. And setting the sidetone to high on the station settings also causes problems. So that's always fun to have extra stuff to try out only to have annoying problems that make them useless.\\n\\n-Using a wired connection fixes some of these issues, but manages to bring in it's own set of problems. First off, if you use a wired connection directly into the station connected to your pc, the volume gets locked at max and suddenly nothing will lower it. Not the headphones, not the station, not even manually trying to change it on your pc works, the volume level goes all the way to 100 and never moves from there. The only way to change volume is in whatever program you have that has it's own volume options. (So let's say, you are watching a YouTube video and you connect your headphones to your station with a wire. The volume is locked at the highest and the only way to change that is in the YouTube video itself since it has it's own volume slider you can adjust. Trying to use PC settings won't work). Connecting a wire directly to your PC doesn't have any problems, except a very glaring one. Since you aren't connected to the station, none of the settings from there will work on the headset. You can't have both a wired and wireless connection as a workaround. So in other words, the $300 you spent for all these cool features come with annoying issues. The only way to avoid them is to use a wired connection directly into your PC, and none of the bonuses that come with the station are available.\\n\\nIf you want wireless gaming headphones, get something else, these are just awful. If you want Bluetooth headphones, you can get much cheaper ones without possible audio problems for cheaper. If you want regular gaming headphones, you can get much better ones at a cheaper price without all the problems this thing has.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"A little bit of context: I game at the same desk that I work at, and will often transition from my work day into gaming afterwords on my Series X. Before buying these, I used a pair of Arctis 9Xs to listen to music and take calls during the day, then transition to gaming in the evening. I listen to music or sports on my laptop while I practice, and thus really valued the Arctis 9X's ability to blend bluetooth audio from my laptop with gaming audio. However, the 9Xs came with a host of issues that started to drive me insane:\\n\\n* Connectivity issues were awful. My headphones would regularly disconnect even when sitting at the desk, and would occur consistently when getting up and moving around\\n* Turning on the headphones would turn on the xbox every time, so when setting up for work I would need to regularly turn off my Xbox since the headphones had turned it on.\\n* The battery life wasn't long enough to last throughout the work day plus a gaming session\\n\\nNow on to the new headphones: first off, they are ridiculously expensive. I really hope Steelseries finds a way to lower the price-point, especially since the sound isn't a huge upgrade over previous generations. That said, for me, they were worth it, because I use my headphones for everything and all of the issues above are resolved:\\n\\n* Connectivity issues are gone. I get a solid connection even when walking around my (small) house\\n* Bluetooth is separate from xbox and can be powered up individually for non-gaming use\\n* The infinity system makes all-day battery usage a non-issue\\n\\nMy only real criticism of these headphones is the audio quality, which isn't much better than the Artcis 9Xs. It is better, and the noise cancelling is a nice addition, but at the price point I was hoping for something on-par with the Bose QuietComfort series and it isn't there.\\n\\nOtherwise, this is a great set of headphones and I'm glad Steelseries validated my decision to believe in them. These headphones are a clear upgrade over the previous gen and they clearly heard and fixed a majority of the pain points.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"This is a review I will be updating more or less yearly. I am probably the definition of a power user for these headphones because I wear the entire day while I work and game, so like 10+ hours of daily wear for years on end. I dual pair and pick up work and family calls. I walk around the house doing chores while on meetings so range is important, everything is being used here.\\n\\nMy previous pair fell apart after 3 years, what was the culprit? The plastic, the plastic arm that holds the cups literally started giving out, flexing and cracking, letting the headband slip out. These headphones still use plastic in those areas, so we'll see.\\n\\nWhat I like:\\n\\nComfort: Excellent. I have a big ole head and the comfort on the novas is far superior. I can't describe it, the headband on the other ones would make my glasses leave marks behind my ears, real acquired taste, maybe a little masochism. These don't do that. The earpads are super soft and nice, I honestly like them more than the wear earwax trap aero weave or whatever the last ones had.\\n\\nSound: Seriously better. The novas along with the sonar software sound a lot brighter and clear. Apparently these near ear pads do some good work on the lowend, doesn't seem to be lacking. Certainly a step up. The previous version you could feel it maxing out and muddying up pretty badly, specially on the crucial low end parts. They could get a little fatiguing and the EQ feature was a little bizarre and harsh. Not horrible but I wouldn't put them anywhere on a top tier list.\\n\\nUser Experience: Same buttons on the side but they are now in this like, recessed area so you have to fiddle around to find them and any rubbing against the plastic translates to loud a** noise in your ears because of the seal the earpads have, it's meh, minor detail in the grand scheme of things but my hand is on those buttons all day, flipping to bluetooth, chatmix, volume, muting. Steelseries please make them like immediately obvious and protruding again please.\\n\\nMicrophone: Fantastic, a lot more sensitive to distance from the mouth than the previous version. I put it a bit too close and I was clipping like a mad man. Easy to get used to, love the fact that it can be EQd in sonar. Better than previous version I think, we'll see.\\n\\nBuild: They feel robust, similar headband deal going on, more subtle with only a couple of adjustment points.\\n\\nBattery life: I could be biased given my previous set had a lot of use but I did buy many new sets of batteries. The novas seem to be able to about twice as far as the pro wireless battery wise.\\n\\nI still think these headphones are the best pound for pound out there when it comes to all around feature set and quality. There's nothing that comes close. Steelseries contact me if you need feedback from someone that wears these 12 hours a day.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"I decided to shell out for a higher end headset, instead of my typical $100-$200 Logitech or Razer headsets, and I am not disappointed at all.\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY: Good sound, the quality is fantastic, and directional sound is spot on. Playing WWZ with my friends they're usually calling out a special but don't know where it is, and I can pinpoint it almost immediately just from the directional sound. Makes for much more immersive experience for gamers, and music/movies are spectacular as well, and the quality doesn't diminish with volume (for those movies that go from \\\"what did he say?\\\" to my face looks like it has a leaf blower aimed at it).\\n\\nTHE MIC/SOUND CANCELLING: The mic actually picks my voice up, it helps when it's 2 inches or less from my mouth, but even farther than that, people can still hear me. As for sound cancelling, in a word: spectacular. This is the first headset I have owned that when it turns off, my brain immediately goes \\\"What just came on in the house?\\\" from the increase in noise, before I realize that's just the ambient hum of my computer, the A/C, fridge, water heater, and everything else in a house that makes very subtle noise. But it isn't disorienting nor does it muffle voices, I can still hear my girlfriend trying to sneak up on me, or if she calls me from another room clear as day.\\n\\nRANGE: It has decent range, I can go most anywhere in my house and it doesn't have an issue except the kitchen, I have to have the left side facing the computer room from the kitchen, but I blame that on all the metal appliances in that room interfering with the signal. Surprisingly, the microwave running right next to me does not affect it, which means the electronics inside are well shielded.\\n\\nCOMFORT: I have noticed the band that rests on top of my head is very slowly stretching, but it has several notches to adjust it tighter as it does, not a big issue for me. The ear pads are great, never really get that ache or sweat from pressure or lack of air.\\n\\nBATTERY: Usually lasts multiple days between charges while being used 2-6 hours a day. I actually like the fact that the battery is removable, it prevents the need for a cord to be attached to the headset if you forgot to charge it the night before. But if you like to charge it overnight, you can plug the headset in to charge the battery, or swap it into the HUD module and charge it. And it's quick to swap the battery, takes me about 10 seconds in total; most of the time I can do it without my friends even noticing I'm gone during a conversation.\\n\\nOTHER FEATURES: The HUD module can have two computers plugged into the USB C inputs and you can actively switch between the two which I personally found very useful. You can even plug in via 3.5mm jack directly to the headset or to the HUD module; I don't use this, but it's a nice option to have. It's nice to have a reference of sound and headset details (battery level, input, volume) for quick troubleshooting such as if everything suddenly goes silent, I can look at the HUD and see if it's receiving sound or not and that will determine whether it's a headset issue or a computer issue. These are all frivolous additions, but can tip a decision one way or another if your teetering between headsets.\\n\\nAnd if you've read everything up this point, you're actually researching headsets and want to make an informed decision, which I hope this helps in that endeavor. For reference I have a slightly smaller than average head coming in at a 7.25 cap size (22 5/8\\\" circumference), my ears do stick out a good amount (if you're worried about the depth of the ear pieces) and they barely touch the fabric covering the speakers if at all. If you have the dough, I think this headset or their newer versions are worth the investment.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"I've been using the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Gaming Headset since October 1, 2022, and it's been an absolute game-changer in my gaming experience. This headset has not only met but exceeded my expectations in every aspect.\\n\\nThe sound quality is phenomenal. The premium Hi-Fi drivers deliver crisp, clear audio that brings games to life. Whether I'm immersed in an intense FPS battle or exploring vast open-world landscapes, the soundstage is rich and detailed, making the experience incredibly immersive.\\n\\nActive Noise Cancellation is a feature I didn't know I needed until I had it. It effectively blocks out external noise, allowing me to focus entirely on my game without distractions. This feature has been particularly useful during competitive gaming sessions where concentration is key.\\n\\nThe Infinity Power System is ingenious, ensuring I'm never without power. Being able to swap out batteries while the other charges is a huge convenience, eliminating the need for wired play when the battery runs low.

I've had marathon gaming sessions, and not once have I felt discomfort or the need to take a break due to the headset. The fit is perfect, with just the right amount of clamp force, and the ear cushions are soft and breathable.\\n\\nThe Stealth Retractable Mic is another standout feature. It's crystal clear, ensuring my teammates can hear me without any issues, and I love how it seamlessly retracts into the headset for a sleek look when not in use.\\n\\nCompatibility with multiple systems (PC, PS5/PS4, Switch, Mobile) has been a boon. I frequently switch between devices, and this headset has handled each transition flawlessly. The versatility and ease of connection across platforms have been impressive.\\n\\nDurability-wise, the headset still feels as sturdy and premium as the day I got it. Despite daily use, there are no signs of wear and tear, which speaks volumes about its build quality.\\n\\nIn summary, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Multi-System Gaming Headset has been outstanding in every way. From sound quality to comfort, from battery life to build quality, it ticks all the boxes. I highly recommend it to any gamer looking for a top-tier wireless headset.

            "        \"1\": \"Recently, I purchased a Victrix BFG Pro. I was skeptical, especially with it lacking vibration. I was borderline not considering it, mostly just because of that. After a few articles showing that Victrix will be adding Hall Effect Sticks in Q1 2024. Price being 40 (USD) for a pair. That's incredible pricing. So awesome upgrade. This matters because I also have a SCUF Instinct Pro Wireless (worst), Razer Wolverine Ultimate (my backup), and my new baby Victrix BFF Pro. Stock, the SCUF comes with no Hard Case. Just the basic swaps for D pad and Sticks. I had to purchase the Hard Case EXTRA, for like 40 or 50, I believe. It came with an additional cord, some additional stick top. And other little stuff. Starting left to right again, The hard case is a nice color grey and the inside is textured and looks great. It's the thinnest of the cases and for one that was paid extra in addition to the most expensive controller of the bunch at 200$ (prices are rough memory estimates). The case for the Victrix is ever so slightly thicker and only noticable if you have them side by side. Both would protect a drop in almost all cases. Inside, the Victrix has a top pocket for the EXTREMELY NICE Purple braided cord (type C to Standard USC). Also has stacked Styrofoam layers of tools and replacement parts, which includes the additional fighting pad that can be swapped with the right joy and button combo pad on the right side of the controller. The next up is the VERY sturdy and thick case. Inside is the pocket up top for the cord and the bottom houses the replacement D pades and sticks (which are held on by high power magnets and is the best setup of the three). With the information given, you'd be understandable in thinking that the SCUF was the worst of the bunch. In price? Sadly, yes. In usability? Hell no. The SCUF is my favorite to use. The reverse button placement is perfect *FOR ME*. Durability wise? Horrible, don't buy, trash, borderline a scam. Not only is SCUF already known for that, it turns out this first of the better QC lot was in fact, crap. Within the first 3 months I had to have it in for a faulty button and faulty bumper. Not a quick process since it's inconvenient to have no controller. Thankfully I'm a nerd lol. Got it back and all was golden. Then after a few months, the same button and bumper started not registering clicks either. Not every time. Just 1/10 I'd say. But you would be shocked how much is messed you up lol. Now, sitting at 14 months with it? Not great at all. 2 buttons. 1 bumper. 1 trigger. All faulty. Never dropped. No liquid anything. Kept literally in a hard case whenever it wasn't in use. I play a few hours a week total so this is minimal use. Terrible product. They will fix it. But I gotta pay for shipping and the full repair. So I'm stuck. Worst 400$ I've ever spent on controller and extras. The Victrix is so awesome. I have medium to medium/large hands lol. Not huge. They are on the CUSP of being too small. Which makes them perfect for me, but it might not be for my bigger brethren out there. I have not noticed the lack of vibration a SINGLE TIME. I even tried to pay attention for it and still didn't notice it. So I guess that's neat lolol. It feels light yet sturdy. It's what you would want for long sessions. Light weight and upgradable/repairable. Victrix doesn't sell replacements of anything yet, that I've noticed. But everything points to Q1 for the start of all that. I've been XBOX my whole life so my brain is struggling with the PlayStation symbols. Sell the XB setup for extra. Just a different single paddle. I'd be so happy. This is my go to by a mile. The Razer Wolverine Ultimate is a wonderful controller. The button placement on the back is TERRIBLE. That's all personal preference so I won't knock it for it. Build is solid. Can't speak for other products of theirs. It's very heavy in comparison. By a chunky margin. But it works great. Feels great. Way cheaper in price but not quality at all. They did a great job with that line. So I'd say\\n\\nSCUF - 6\\nVicxtrix - 9\\nRazer - 7.5/8\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"So I'll start with the best and main feature: The modular face. I can't stress how awesome this thing is for players like me that struggle to find button/dpag/analog setups that work for the way we like to play. For example, I play claw style, so having the 6-button option is a must. Need to go back to play a game where 4-button makes more sense? No problem, just swap the pieces, which is super easy. And those units can be flipped, so for instance, I like the dpad in the top-left most position (by default, that's where the analog stick is, like what you see in the picture), so I simply flipped it. When I'm playing, I also hate having the analog stick in the way, again, no problem, just pops right off (and you get extras).\\n\\nThis modular feature is important because if you play enough, eventually buttons and dpads go out. For a long time, I was using the Hori FC4 (original design), which was a great controller and fairly inexpensive, but the one drawback was that it broke down pretty fast. Pro players that use the dualshock will tell you they replace them every several months, at most. Although I haven't seen it yet, I have to imagine that Victrix will sell the face pieces separately, which will eventually not only give players like me the ability to easily and cheaply replace wornout components, but it opens the door for more designs for those pieces in the future.\\n\\nOtherwise, it has a bunch of other premium features. You can go wired, which for many of us is really important, and the wire is nice and sturdy. Same with the case for the controller and all the various pieces to it. It has a built-in feature to program (or turn off) the back-grip buttons, and multiple profile options, so even though there is an app that allows for more input customization (which is also a rad feature), you don't need that to do some basic input customization. It also has built-in trigger stops, which is amazing, and a tournament mode to disable your system buttons and the touchpad. The pad has a nice, heavy weight to it, too.\\n\\nBefore I got this thing, it was clear it was designed for tournament play in mind. The question I had was whether the dpad(s) would be any good. I use the old, basic, Nintendo cross-style and so far it's working really well. All of the other features, too, are highly-desirable when in a tournament setting, and they function great. But, they went beyond that to ensure that if you want to use it like a normal, casual controller, you clearly can.\\n\\nSo I'll say that at this point it seems the wait was worth it, but I'll end with a caveat: This isn't a casual controller. The price tag should probably tell you that, but I can easily see certain people being disappointed with this thinking it's going to be good for casual use. You really have to be thinking about a competitive setting to see the value you're getting with this pad's features. This controller is comparable in quality to something like the Razer Wolverine v2 but has way better features for competitive play and practice, yet the Wolverine is $70 more. I've used the Victrix for casual gaming already and I can tell you it works great there, too, but unless you're taking advantage of all the features that a non-competitive game *isn't* going to use, then this is probably too expensive.\\n\\nUltimately, a fantastic controller.\\n\\nEDIT: The Victrix Control Hub now works with the BFG, so that eliminates one criticism I had. Now the only thing left for them to address is replacement parts for the modular pieces. This could be make or break though: I've asked them about this and for now even requesting parts directly is not an option. The clock is ticking on that because when everyone starts to have breakdowns, no one is paying for a brand new BFG when a piece that should be really replaceable can't be replaced. That's going to wreck this thing's reputation.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"The Good: This is by far the most responsive, decisive controller I've ever purchased, with excellent remappable buttons for all buttons and triggers, not just the typical 4 buttons, Triangle, Circle, X, and Square PS style, or A, B, X, Y. The 2 triggers used for driving games (Rocket League) can be adjusted to the level of depression as well, which makes dribbling in Rocket League much easier (I play Rocket League Primarily). The joysticks are extremely easy to move, making sharp turns the fastest I've ever been able to accomplish, which is very important in Rocket League to cut off the ball, or turn fast when close to the ball. The included accessories and case are top notch. The dongle for PC eliminates the need for Bluetooth pairing, which is a great plus, as pairing Bluetooth constantly and issues with that is eliminated as well.\\n\\nThe Bad: The thumb grips on the control sticks could use a more rubbery surface to prevent thumb slippage while maneuvering fast, this is a problem with almost all controllers really on the market. Also, the controller is made for small to average sized hands sadly, as that's the biggest issue I have with it. I have very large hands, and the ends of the grips end in the middle of my palms versus a full grip that the Sonicon controller which is much larger than a standard PS4/5 controller that fits my hands superbly. If the PDP Victrix Pro BFG was made at least 1/3rd larger in size, it would accommodate the hands of more people, particularly adults who would be the primary purchaser of such an expensive controller, but well worth it due to the GOOD that I previously mentioned. I'd gladly pay 50 dollars more or even higher for a larger controller exactly like this present one. I hope other companies follow Sonicon's lead in making controllers larger, as smaller controllers with back paddles that can be remapped are out of place for those of us with medium to larger sized hands.\\n\\nOverall: This is easily the best controller I've ever purchased, even with it size issue, I'm learning to place my hands to make it work. Grip extenders do not work sadly, as the shape of the grips being angular rather than round, do not fit and come off shortly after applying. Perhaps they could make a version with the ability to extend the grips by an add on would help solve the problem for large handed individuals, but that wouldn't address the buttons being smaller or the placement of the back paddles which would still be out of place. The real solution would be to make this same controller, just in a larger size for big handed individuals. Till someone does address this issue, like Sonicon did (my previously favorite controller due to its size and responsiveness), I'll have to deal with the current market's limitations on their smaller sized controllers.\\n\\nUpdate: It's JUST TOO SMALL! I cannot adapt to this tiny controller built for children obviously or small adults. Playing Rocket League I'm constantly backflipiping due to the buttons being too close together for my larger than a child's sized thumb. Very frustrating trying to make it work, but in the end, this controller is flat out too small to use effectively for an adult, unless you have puny hands and fingers. The search for an adult sized excellent controller for Rocket League continues sadly. On to the next.\",\n",

I received this controller on 10 FEB 2023.\\n\\nThere are serious problems with this controller:\\n\\n1. Stick Drift: The stick drift progressively has gotten worse. At first, I was able to set my right stick dead-zone to 6%. After 60 days it had to be adjusted all the way up to 28%. This is where it's been at ever since. I noticed that even at 28%, when the controller battery gets low, the stick drift will kick in once again and become quite severe to the point the controller is unusable for the remainder of battery life. After turning controller off and back on while recharging, the stick drift tends to stabilize somewhat.\\n\\n2. Audio I/O: There is no built-in microphone so using a headset with microphone is a must- if you want to talk. The battery life is indicated by a small battery indicater with 3 measures. All 3 full means fully charged, 2 means halfway charged, 1 means on low, and blinking means almost drained. If the controller is halfway charged (2 measures) or lower the audio starts cutting out and so does the microphone to the headset. I would actually say all peripheral devices connected to the controller start \\\"acting up\\\".\\n\\n3. Victrix Control Hub App Driver Conflict: Finally, as of June 2023, the \\\"VictrixCompatibility (1).reg\\\" file was released in support of the ongoing \\\"COULD NOT CONNECT \\u2013 Victrix Control Hub App Driver Conflict\\\". So, enthusiastically, I ran the registry update and followed the instructions per PDP's help page. Success, the app finally recognized the controller and the Firmware was being installed- so I thought. Well, the firmware never installed and instead bricked my controller. I followed to the letter all the instructions. I did not disconnect the controller or even minimize the window. After 90mins of staring at my screen and seeing no status bar progress I disconnected the controller as it was obvious something was very wrong. The controller is bricked and does not respond to any button presses. The Victrix app doesn't even recognize the controller as connected. If you value having a working controller, do not use this app. Now, I'm stuck with a $200 Pro BFG paper weight.\\n\\nFor $200 I would not recommend this controller. The stick drift, lack of app support, audio I/O and battery bugs make this controller just completely unreliable. Usually, for this kind of money you would expect to have a top-shelf quality item. I have played everyday for many hours for the past 130 days and I can confidently say it is not a quality item that stands the test of time. It does not stand up to the expectation of stress and performance one would expect from a $200 item. Even the standard PS5 dual sense controllers are cheaper, non-customizable, and drain battery life quicker, yet they do not have these problems.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Controller is S-tier in almost every category of things.\\n\\nI'm going to go over the incredibly short list of cons before I go over the list of pros;\\n- won't turn on your PS5 (you can use your TV remote if you have a TV from this decade).\\n- currently doesn't have an app or software, so you have to change button configurations manually\\n\\nNOW FOR THE LONG LIST OF PROS:\\nThe ergonomics and overall design/engineering is honestly far superior to any other PS5 or even Xbox controller on the market. It is a HIGH QUALITY, WELL-DESIGNED controller meant for LONG SESSIONS or tournament play.\\n- Configuring back buttons and profiles is super easy, so is everything else, I'll add a link on how to use all the features at the end of this review.\\n- The back buttons feel better than any other controller I've ever held, to include the new Razer, the Scufs, the Elite Series 2 (which are my #2 favorite paddles now).\\n- The D-Pads are wonderful, not loud and clicky like razers but have a nice muted feedback to them, I prefer the hybrid d-pad or the Victrix d-pad.\\n- Super easy to swap out thumb sticks and modules and rotate them. Thumbsticks feel great, the longer one is impressive for FPS/TPS.\\n- Triggers are sensitive, require very little actuation force. Super reactive, really a 10/10, trigger stops seem more like they have 3 stopping points than 5, but still super easy to use. Triggers are also textured for grip, but very soft.\\n- The grips on the controller are perfect.\\n- 2 Year warranty as opposed to other companies.\\n- Customer support is better than any of the other companies who I've ordered controllers from.\\n- l1/r1 buttons have a different feel than any other button on the controller, very similar to mouseclicks.\\n- Controller is LIGHT. This will not hurt your hands after a 10 hour play session.\\n\\nEvery single button/stick/interface on this controller is designed with comfort and efficiency in mind.\\nIt is SIGNIFICANTLY better than any other PS5 Pro Controller Alternative. Its ergonomics alone make it better than the Razer Pro (F-tier design, and FFF tier customer support). The Dualsense Edge only has two paddles, and a three hour battery life, which also make it an unworthy comparison. While SCUF's quality is nice, they have a 6-month warranty period, and are SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive. SCUF also modifies the DS5 as opposed to building a god-tier controller from the ground up.\\n\\nI've used this controller on both my PS5 and PC and must say that I've yet to experience a better controller.\\n\\nAnd this review is BEFORE they've even released the software for it. I can't wait to see what that's going to be like!\\n\\nLink to their instructions; https://support.pdp.com/hc/en-us/articles/11045034301325-Victrix-Pro-BFG-Wireless-Controller-for-PS5-PS4-and-PC-User-Guide\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"Pros: The controller is very comfortable, it has great d-pad options & the diamond d-pad itself is the best I ever used; the buttons feel nice on press too. It's great for PC and the Steam app. The case it comes with is very good; I love the fact that you can switch around controller styles & you can make the analog sticks have octagon gates. It was built with many different types of people in mind. I like the fact that this controller was designed & intended for the type of people who don't want to switch between 2 or more different types of controllers to play a variety of games. This controller is very close to perfection in my opinion and Victrix could make the next installment even better if done with even more types of people in mind.\\n\\nCons: Too expensive, no bluetooth, it's very annoying when you have to use the screwdriver everytime you wanna change the style, and you can't remove the 4 back buttons when not in use. Out the box you'll see that the triggers are super sensitive and activates at times you dont want them to because you slightly pressed them. The software isnt helpful when it comes to the triggers; if you wanna play sfv or any 6-button fighting game, you can't make the R1 & R2 into L1 & L2. This is because as of the time of this review, you cant change what the trigger buttons do in the software app; this could be fixed with a simple update. THE MECHANISMS FOR THE TRIGGER LEVELSp ARE THE WORST DESIGN EVER!! It's annoying to change the trigger levels and a pain to set it to the middle level. Everytime I play a game my finger would accidentally touch/slide across the trigger switcher and it cause the trigger to reset to the default trigger position. In the software app I have the triggers set to activate at the very bottom of a press; so when the sensitive trigger mechanism gets touched & resets the triggers to the top position, the game wouldn't recognize my fingers pressing the triggers down unless I switched it back to the bottom position. When this happens while I play online in a fighting game, I have to stop playing and fix the triggers back to the position where the game will recognize it again; and while I'm fixing all this my opponent gets a bunch of free hits on my character. When this happens every time you begin to realize that this controller is unplayable unless you get rid of the trigger lock mechanism. I very much think this controller should have trigger locks but just not this specific one that this controller has built into it. This controller is too expensive for its flaws.\\n\\nOpinion:\\nThis is a cool controller, the case along with the other accessories you get inside the box are all useful and it gives you alot to test with. The diamond d-pad is my favorite part about this controller, it just feels great when playing online in fighting games. I definitely want Victrix to make more fightpads in the future, but the software app customization should be more like 8bitdo and the trigger lock switches should be like the xbox elite controller. It's too expensive for the amount of flaws and frustration it causes. I thought this controller would be the fightpad to make me feel like I could stop searching for a perfect controller to use for fighting games, but that's not the case here. I did see a few youtuber reviews who also agree that this controller isn't worth the high price and that there are too many flaws. There are also tons of youtubers praising this controller and I just wanted to share my experience. I honestly think Victrix can improve on these flaws and make an even better controller in the future; I do like the options it offers but not the execution. For the current price you can probably find more affordable & less stressful options. In my attached review photo; the red controller next to the Victrix pro bfg is an Aliexpress controller that I got in June 2022 for $25-30. It has a great d-pad, the button presses are responsive and works with whatever fighting game you like; I highly recommend it, just search fightpad on Aliexpress and you should see it. At most this is not a bad controller it's just too expensive, if this controller was $100 or less and had the same issues, I probably wouldn't have written so much in this review tbh. If you don't wanna spend almost $200 for a fightpad, then I'm sure you can find cheaper alternatives.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Controllers are overpriced period. $200 is not worth having a few extra buttons and a trigger stop. With that said I do need the back paddles and this controller has those. Nice and light and has held up perfectly for the past 12 months without any drift or issues. I have it 5 stars but with I can turn on the system with the controller, you have to turn on the PS5 before using this. For less than $200, this is a great option. $150 would be a good price point though.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I have never used a scuf before and was pretty happy that it only took a couple minutes to get used to the paddles on the back. I still accidentally press them every once in a while but I chalk it up to a skill issue. I really like that everything can be remapped how you want it through the app. FYI you have to have access to Windows in order to update the controller and use wirelessly with the PS5. Overall definitely recommend this as oppose to the DualSense Edge, and its cheaper too!!\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"First off, if you play fighting games on pad, the Victrix is the best PS5 option currently. The Hori Octa Fighting Commander is fine in every way except for where it counts most - the D-Pad. It's way too small.\\n\\nThe Victrix BFG here, has a WAY better D-Pad that is also customizable per ones taste. The fight button module is rather clicky, as it should be. The extra back triggers/paddles can be a bit too easy to accidentally hit, or at least the lower 2 are - so I disabled them in the software. The software itself is kinda finicky, but I set it up once and never had an issue again.\\n\\nFor reference, I play Guilty Gear Strive, and so far I have made considerably less input errors on this pad compared to the Hori. 623 inputs always come out, although half circle inputs for supers can be finicky if I do them too fast (might be a me problem. I bound the back paddles to RC and dash Macros, and so far I haven't had any issues with hitting the wrong triggers.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this to people who want a dedicated PS5 pad, although the price by itself can be hard to overcome if you just set it up for Fighting games and never swap modules like I do. This, I must give it 4 stars.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"Pros: This is a pro controller that allows you to customize your game play like no other controller on the market. If you like to play PS version of controller you have that option. If you prefer Xbox style. You have that option. Arcade style you have that option as well! and software for updates to your controller. There's a button for PS and PC. PC will give you Xbox (A,B,X,Y) output on your screen.\\n\\nCons: Back buttons don't feel comfortable while playing. I find myself pushing them unnecessarily. I unmapped them since its easy to press them on accident.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Quick background, skip if uninterested: I\\u2019m absolutely not an audiophile so this review doesn\\u2019t come from a place of incredible pickiness. My old (and cheap) headset broke in the middle of playing online with friends. I was very upset and rushed to Best Buy that evening in an attempt to quickly replace it. Needless to say I was tempted into buying something else(a different \\u201cgamer headset\\u201d brand) and hated it a lot. After fighting with that horrible setup for a few hours, I decided to order the Arctis 7+ here.\\n\\nStart of review for the particular 7+ model I bought off here:\\nDELIVERY- I ordered it and it arrived wayyy earlier than I expected. I was so excited to try it out. So far I\\u2019ve used them them for about 2-3 months.\\nCOMFORTABLE- I can say they\\u2019re very very comfortable. Even after some 10 hour play sessions, I almost forget they\\u2019re there and bump them. The pads around the ears are a perfectly soft material. They\\u2019re a soft fabric material that does not break down like I\\u2019ve noticed the smooth fake leather to. These also don\\u2019t get too hot around my ears thanks to the breathable padding material.\\nI have long hair and OTHER headphones tend to grab and pull out my hair a lot- I haven\\u2019t had that issue with this set except a couple times where the fault was all on me because I pulled a joint area through my hair. Otherwise, it seems it\\u2019s really hard for this to happen on accident like my other sets always did (Owwy!)\\nUnlike most other headphones, this set has an elastic- yet soft- band under the headband that pretty much suspends the headphones over your head rather than resting their weight directly on the top of your scalp. I find that this design choice really improves the comfort for me, as with other headphone sets the weight and rigidity of the headband start to hurt over time. The Bluetooth feature on this also allows me to sit back, play from a couch, or go get a drink (important!) while still talking to my friends.\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY- I once again want to remind that I am no audiophile. After getting these and starting some gameplay, I immediately noticed highs and lows I wasn\\u2019t hearing from my old headsets. Little environmental sounds, instruments in soundtracks I never noticed or heard before, subtle feedback sounds from button presses and menus, I recall calling them out to my friends and them being equally surprised I now noticed them.\\nOne of my personal gripes with modern headphones lately is that every company wants to make super bassy sounding headphones, as the average person associates quality with bass for some reason. Out of the box, all of the sound levels for these are perfect in my opinion, not too bassy or anything. If you wanted bassy headphones out of this though, you could easily just go in and change that using the steel series sound control app. I haven\\u2019t changed anything myself because I like how they sound as is.\\nAnother thing I wanted was independent volume control for the headphones, which this has! Not only can you control the volume with a dial on the headset but you can also adjust wether you want chat or game sounds to be louder than the other on the headset. I was also concerned that audio quality may differ between wired or wireless connection, but everything seems fine regardless of connection type. Mic quality is decent for hanging out and talking to friends. We never have static issues, it never catches annoying background noise, no chirps, so far I\\u2019ve heard no issue myself. The mic quality probably isn\\u2019t something you\\u2019d use for high quality production, like making videos, podcasts, or streaming. Though you probably could do any of those things if you\\u2019re not a stickler for recording quality. I feel it\\u2019s mainly a headset for comfortably gaming- a role it\\u2019s more than fulfilled for me!\\n\\nNOISE CANCELLATION- I\\u2019m personally indifferent to wether my headsets have noise cancellation or not. I don\\u2019t live in a particularly loud place, so I don\\u2019t get to test this one out much. Every once in a while another family member may approach me to ask something, and I can hear them at that point, but not if they call from another room. The outer side of the mic has a small mic that picks up sound outside your headset and feeds it back to you with a subtle and quiet delay. I\\u2019m not used to that myself but it does come in handy here and there. It does sometimes also trick me into thinking the headset mic is picking up and putting outside noise into my calls (it\\u2019s not though, confirmed by friends). I\\u2019m indifferent to this feature, as it hasn\\u2019t caused me too much issue and I\\u2019m pretty sure it can be turned off.\\n\\nOTHER FEATURES- The mic is posable and retracts, it\\u2019s a pretty nice way to store the headset or just get the mic out of your peripheral vision until in use.\\nThere\\u2019s a small button on the left side that mutes the mic, when muted the mic lights red, which is a pretty handy visual reminder as in the past I have often found myself talking for minutes on end to myself while in calls with friends (lol).\\nThe headset comes with some other wired connection options, even a headphone Jack option.\\nTo connect to your computer it DOES use a wired dongle, so if you are trying to save on USB port space, be aware it does take one.\\nI\\u2019m not sure how to measure this, the Bluetooth connectivity works throughout my whole room and even in the rooms immediately over. I am usually able to go to my kitchen and prepare myself food or drinks while still enjoying music or talking, so long as the battery has a decent charge.\\nThe battery life is REALLY good. I personally have always made it a habit to charge anything when I\\u2019m not using it, so I never see it die. BUT to vouch for its lifetime- one time I didn\\u2019t realize the USB end of my cord wasn\\u2019t plugged into my computer until after a week of thinking I had been charging it nightly after game sessions and daily use. This thing lasted a whole week of /at least/ 6-8 hour use daily with absolutely no charging that whole time before I just happened to pull on the usb for it and find it had never been plugged back in that whole week. So for sure with this headset, unless you\\u2019re playing insanely all the time with the highest volume in use, you\\u2019ll never see it die so long as you check it in for a charge here and there!\\n\\nEnd summary: Overall I can say I\\u2019m very happy with this headset. Definitely has become my favorite one. I would strongly recommend it to anyone that wants a headset suited best for comfortable gaming and chatting. I was skeptical of Bluetooth functionality before buying, but it has WELL PAST won me over.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"This is perhaps the only headset I've had where my hair doesn't constantly get stuck. The cuffs are nice and soft, and the light weight of the headset lead to my usually 2-3 hour stream to be nearly 6 hours without noticing the time. Could have probably gone longer too. The battery life lasts me a good few days w/o needing to be charged every day. The quality of the sound is nice too with the only downside being no noise canceling, but I like to be able to hear my environment in case of emergencies and knowing what will and will not be picked up by my mic. It does take a bit to get the split audio sorted, so patience is a must especially if you are not familiar with it. I found it easy enough if you are familiar with headset software.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"The headset fits really nice, it's light and VERY comfortable, you barely feel it after a long while of using them. Sound quality is really good, for music and gaming is amazing. I've tried it with Gears 5 and DMC 5 and it's simply amazing. Easy to use after you quickly check the manual, can use the transmitter with the PC and the Bluetooth with the phone simultaneously, and that's cool.\\nThe bad: The software. Download ONLY the Engine application, NEVER ACTIVATE THE SONAR APP, it's supposed to be for spatial sound, but not only doesn't sound that good, it'll override your sound system and make a mess to use your PC without the headphones, could only fix after uninstalling, so beware.\\nBTW: The heatset sounds amazing with Dolby Atmos and cool with DTS (but the voices can get kinda muddy with DTS).\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I really like how it can connect to Bluetooth and through the wireless dongle concurrently. I've had Bluetooth earbuds that advertise multipoint connections, but those ones just swap between devices when it detects audio rather than allow you to hear both simultaneously.\\n\\nI dislike how tight these feel around my head. My previous headphones were very comfortable; I could wear them all day. These ones make my head feel constricted and my ears hot. You can adjust the height of the headphones but not how tight it wraps around your head as far as I can tell. Another negative is that it slips around my head when I tilt it forward or backwards.\\n\\nThe microphone is decent out of the box; crystal clear but a tad on the soft side and not very authentic sounding. The audio is also plenty good out of the box. I'd say the sonar software isn't required to be pleased with the product. I personally haven't downloaded it, but I'm sure it would allow for a greater set of customization and improve the sound and microphone experience.\\n\\nThere is also some side tone when your mic is on, whether you are in a call or not, that amplifies the sound of your surroundings. You can mute your mic to stop this.\\n\\nMy final observation I will mention is in regards to the battery indicator. It's not very specific. The indicator stays green between the wide range of 50% to 100%. Even while charging you can't really tell if it's close to being fully charged. I can confirm though that the charging indicator will turn off by itself when the battery is at 100%.\\n\\nUpdate: After spending more time using these headphones, I have a few new observations to add to my review.\\n\\nI noticed sound leaks through the foam earcup cushions. If there's anyone around you and the sound is at or above a medium volume, it can be heard. Likewise, the microphone can pick up sound from the drivers above a certain threshold.\\n\\nThe headphones have been stretched to fit my head better. I can wear it for longer periods of time now without feeling like my head is going to explode, though I stick to my original sentiment of it not being the most comfortable.\\n\\nFinally, I will also mention the audio has gotten glitchy on me a couple of times. The first time this happened I just did a quick reset to fix it. The second time I just waited, and after roughly 5 - 10 seconds it fixed itself. I'm assuming the connection momentarily became weak. I'm not sure why as I was sitting right next to the dongle both times.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I finally know how to use my headset. It took some trial and error, mostly because I've never used a wireless headset with some of these features, and never this brand. I hope the information helps you.\\n\\nNow that I've gotten everything figured out, I am having a great experience with this headset. Here are the things I've learned:\\n\\nLeft earcup: The rearmost button mutes the mic. If you have the boom extended, the mic will have a glowing red (and annoying) stripe. There is probably a way to turn that off, but as far as I can tell, the mic works perfectly well fully retracted. So when that button is raised, the mic is muted. When it's pressed in, it's live. I like that tactile system better.\\n\\nVolume knob: Slide it to the rear to increase, to the front to decrease. I recommend staring in the lower 1/2 of the dial the first time you use these.\\n\\nPorts and stuff: I'll let the manual handle these. Reminder, you can use the headset wired using the USB cable that comes with the headset (or I guess any USB cable that has USB-C on at least 1 end).\\n\\nRight earcup: This is where I had trouble figuring things out. The knob is the chatmix knob, which should let you adjust the strength of your media volume against the strength of the volume in whatever chat app you're using. To the rear for media, to the front for chat. I had the wheel halfway between the halfway mark and the front, and all the volume for the media I was streaming was super quiet. I thought maybe the headset had a volume limiter, but per support, it does not. Instead of trying all the 'pull off the foam and reset/ reinstall everything' that was already a fresh install, almost by accident I found out that if you have the knob halfway (has a nice little click or bump when you hit the middle), the volume is fine. I currently have mine halfway between the halfway mark and all the way back. If I need to adjust it, I know how now.\\n\\nSide Tone: This is a software feature. It lets you hear what your mic is picking up. HEAVEN FORBID you accidentally rub your arm or your sleeve over the mics while this feature is on. It nearly scared the life out of me until I figured out how to turn that off. It's in the software.\\n\\nThat's about it, I'm having fun playing with the EQ in Sonar to get the sound exactly as I like it, and the headset is as nice and loud as I'd like it to be. Definitely glad I made this purchase, upgrading to a wireless headset has been life-changing already.\\n\\nOH! And the range. I have a 1 br apartment, 1 bath, kitchen, living area, dining area. If you think of the living area as the front right quadrant, bedroom rear left, bathroom rear right and dining room front left: I was able to travel to every far corner of the apartment with no problem. I am not taking this outside while the dongle is on my PC, so it has all the range I need. People with large ranch or multi-level homes, your experience may vary, but it's certainly not as bad as some reviews made it sound.\\n\\nAlso the headband and ear cups are every bit as comfortable as nearly every says they are.\\n\\nEnjoy!\",\n",

My only complaint is they tend to run a bit small or tight but that might be because I have a bigger head (hat size 7-3/4). Volume could get a little louder but I'm old and don't hear so good. I don't really use all the bells and whistles but they have them if you're into that kind of thing. I use them for online gaming with my son and they are great for that.

            "        \"8\": \"3.5 stars.\\nPros:\\n3rd most comfortable headphones I've worn.\\nDecent range - I can go downstairs to the kitchen or down 2 flights to the front door without losing connection.\\nEasy to setup\\nRed light on the mike so I *know* whether or not I'm muted\\nMike does good noise-cancelling (headphones don't do active NC)\\nOK sound quality.\\n\\nDisappointments:\\nI bought an Arctis 7 five years ago and used it daily since then, mostly for work video conferencing. However, I started having some problems with the mic cutting in and out and then one of the earpads fell off so I figured I'd finally replace it. I went looking for the same ski-goggle-strap style headband because it's the most comfortable of any headphones that my partner or I have tried. Sadly, no one else seems to have picked up the same style and SteelSeries is getting rid of it in favor of a less-adjustable option for their Nova.\\n\\nAfter trying a logitech option and being disappointed, I decided I'd just go with the same thing I bought last time rather than trying to find something new. I thought the 7+ would be basically the same, but it's not. The first one I got kept randomly shutting off. Whatever, some devices are duds and Amazon exchanged it easily for me. But this new one is still worse than the original 7. It's less comfortable, although that might be more about breaking it in. But the mute button only occasionally works. I have to stick my fingernail in it to get it to pop open. Sometimes it'll seem like it popped open, but the red light doesn't switch so I know I'm not muted.\\n\\nThen there's the software. I installed the software and updated the headphones firmware, and it was basically fine. I tried the new Sonar tools and adjusted the sounds so they sounded good. I really liked that I could adjust the mike to fit my higher-pitched voice. Very cool. Only, when I select the \\\"sonar\\\" options in my audio list, the headphones just don't work. No sound comes through at all. Fortunately, there's still a generic option for the \\\"arctis 7+\\\" and I've been using that instead. The headphones beep when they turn on/off. The old ones did too, but this beep is higher pitched and much more annoying.\\n\\nI'd probably return them if I were inside the return window because that's a lot of caveats for the money. But they're good in a lot of ways and I'm biased by the comparison with the earlier Arctis 7, which were the best headphones I've ever owned.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"So I've had the Arctis 7 headset for years and it never really fit well (I put up with it because the sound quality was SO much better than other brands) so I was a bit skeptical about buying the Nova 7 headset.... All of that went away the second I put the Nova headset on. It's lightweight, fully adjustable, and the sound quality improved over the Arctis 7 line. I've already had profiles set up in GG so switching over to the Nova from the old Arctis was easy, I didn't even have to mess with any of my old profiles, the Nova just made everything sound so much better. I marked the noise canceling lower because it's not true noise canceling, if you have it at a lower volume, sound does bleed through. But the audio quality of the drivers is so good that unless you have a rave going off next to you, you won't hear a thing other than what's playing through the headset. I've been in music production and mixing for the past decade and the Nova is better than my studio headphones. As soon as I got them, I loaded up some of my favorite bass-heavy music and blasted it through the headset. Steelseries might as well advertise these as haptic because the bass gets them moving. My friends in Discord say the mic quality is good, which I also have filtered through GG. Overall, I couldn't be happier.\\n\\nIf you're considering getting this headset and don't mind running Steelseries GG to tweak your sound profiles, definitely get it.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"I got into the habit of writing my reviews after a few weeks/months, as the joy of unpacking and trying the new product out for the first time is often so great that you subconsciously tend to ignore minor flaws. Once you have used what you have bought for several weeks, you can certainly give other buyers much more useful tips than at first. After about 4 months with the Arctis Nova 7 Wireless Headset I can say that it excels compared to the competition in the same price-range.\\nThe set has a soft, elastic band under the headband which means that it suspends the headphones over your head rather than resting its weight directly on the top of your scalp which means that it's EXTREMELY comfortable and the set never started to hurt over time. Sound quality is excellent for this price range BUT it needs tweaking. Luckily, the SteelSeries GG Sonar app is easy to use and does an good job in this regard. Noise cancellation is OK-ish. Functional but a bit below the expected standard at times. The mic also needs some tweaking but it's perfectly fine once tuned.\\nThe Bluetooth functionality is the absolute highlight of the set. Really effective, it never let me down. My only complaint is the build materials. The plastic (the set has no metal parts!) is fragile. For the price, I would have expected some sturdier materials. So buy a case or a stand for it, it's a must.\\nOverall, I\\u2019m very happy with this headset. I would strongly recommend it to anyone that wants a headset for comfortable long sessions of gaming and chatting with flawless Bluetooth functionality.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"I\\u2019ve gone through exactly 3 headsets (The official Microsoft Xbox One headset, PlayStation Gold Wireless headset 2018, and a Razor headset) looking for a viable option that had both DECENT audio and mic quality, as all the headsets I\\u2019ve purchased have had build quality issues and terrible mic quality. I\\u2019ve given up on picking up a wireless headset as from what I\\u2019ve seen, are incredibly expensive. I saw the ad for the SteelSeries Arctic 1 headset and it seemed too good to be true (very cheap price for a wireless headset, and interchange between 3 consoles) and to my surprise, it lived up to pretty much all its claims.\\n\\nWireless connectivity works seamlessly with its included dongle, and I have had zero dropouts or latency issues with it on both PS4 and Nintendo Switch. I originally purchased this headset primarily for the PS4, as I imagined wireless headsets were completely incompatible with the Nintendo Switch, but the headset does in-fact work effortlessly and all the buttons on the headset (Mic Mute On/Off, Volume Dial) work on both systems. Mic quality is excellent as well as audio quality, it\\u2019s perfectly balanced and not ridiculously skewed towards bass, and the volume can be raised very high on both consoles if you want. Battery life so far has also been great, it\\u2019s something I haven\\u2019t had to worry about when using and I only had to charge them once every week out of habit. The headset itself doesn\\u2019t feel flimsy and seems decently built, It\\u2019s pretty light and is surprisingly comfortable to wear, so much I use it also when I\\u2019m on my laptop. The only thing that slightly annoys me is that when I switch playing consoles and want to use the headset on it, I have to get up and unplug the headset dongle and connect it to the console I\\u2019m using (say, from the PS4 to the Nintendo Switch). This is pretty much a first world problem, but it\\u2019s something I\\u2019ve come across every once in a while.\\n\\nOverall I have to say I\\u2019m really loving this headset, if you were on the fence for this thing I really recommend you give it a try.\\n\\nUPDATE June 2020: It\\u2019s been 8 months since I\\u2019ve bought this headset, and I just wanted to report back that it has held up ROCK SOLID. This thing is by all means not flimsy, and the battery life has held up incredibly well. I\\u2019ve been gaming really long sessions, roughly 5-6 hours long each with friends online, and this thing just keeps going with no issues whatsoever. One of the few purchases I\\u2019ve made that I can say was absolutely worth it.\\n\\nFINAL UPDATE April 2021: Managed to get myself a PS5 and happy to say the headset works flawlessly with it. The new thing I love about the headset now is that the PS5 has a USB-C port in the front, which means you don\\u2019t have to use the included cable that comes with the headset dongle for USB-A, you can plug it directly to the PS5 and it sits flush and is almost unnoticeable.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"As an average gamer, non-audiophile, and PC user, I bought and used a pair of Astro A20s as my first wireless headset and I regret it deeply. The mic was really sensitive; any sort of breath, head movement, adjusting of the headset, background noise, etc would come through. Not only that, but I would also hear static and crackling noises occasionally. Also, if I would move my head at all, the headset would creak. Very annoying. On multiple occasions, I would find that when I turned on my PC, the dongle would disconnect and require a cycle of pressing the button and restarting the computer until it would connect again. Resorted to permanently leaving my PC on because of this. The directional sound was also non-existent...false advertising.\\nI DON'T HAVE ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS WITH THIS NEW HEADSET!!!\\nThe sound is amazing; I can hear sounds from all directions and there is no crackling/static. The ear pads are very comfortable; I game on my PC for at least 10 hours per day, and I have yet to experience any soreness or fatigue. Noise cancelling on the mic is excellent. The range is pretty good; I can walk from my room to the downstairs kitchen without the headset disconnecting. The headset is also rhythm game-friendly, as the audio does not lag or desync at all--a problem I experienced with the A20. Battery life seems to be accurate. My only gripe is that I have to download the SteelSeries software to customize the audio, which requires creating an account and giving out my email address.\\nOverall, if you are not an audiophile and want a good wireless headset for a budget-friendly price, I highly recommend the Arctis 1. I'm sure any other SteelSeries model is great; my sister has the Arctis 7 and loves it. I settled with this one because it was the cheapest I could find (and less expensive than the A20).\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Okay let me start off and say that this headset is TREMENDOUSLY GOOD. I been using Astros for years and i kinda got burnt out on it & i wanted to try something new and then i came across Steelseries Arctis 1 Wireless. I\\u2019ve heard about Steelseries for quite sometime but never really bothered getting a headset until now.\\n\\nComfort 10/10 : Let me honestly say that this is the most comfortable headset i have ever wore in my entire life. I\\u2019ve been through Astro A40s, Astro A50s, Turtle Beach ( I don\\u2019t recommend btw ) , Somy headsets and this took me by surprise. For a $100!? It\\u2019s honestly amazing. The clamping force is really not bad. Doesn\\u2019t hurt your ears or anything when putting them on. Also the very soft leather material they use on the Ear Cups is the best i have felt.\\n\\nDurability 10/10 : Now you may think it looks like a very cheap plastic. I\\u2019m gonna let you know that it\\u2019s not. They use a very strong plastic & what makes this even better is the very strong reinforced steel they use on the headband which makes it very durable and flexible. This doesn\\u2019t mean you can just throw your headset because it\\u2019s that durable. As every other gaming headset just take them off gently and place them down gently to avoid any damage. Overall you don\\u2019t have to worry about this breaking on you unlike that cheap plastic that Turtle Beach use. If i can compare to another headset in terms of durability it would be Astros. It\\u2019s that good.\\n\\nSound 10/10 : Boy oh Boy let me just say. When i first hooked these up i was SHOCKINGLY stunned how loud these were. It was to the point i legit had to turn them down a notch because it was that loud. You definitely get your bass, Low, Mids & Highs. You have very good directional sounds so you can hear enemy footsteps from behind, front, ledt & right perfectly well and you can also tell weather they\\u2019re up top or at the bottom. Overall the Sound Quality is top tier so don\\u2019t listen to the reviews of ppl saying it\\u2019s bad\\n\\nNoise Cancellation 10/10 : Steelseries definitely nailed it on this one. When you put this on you cam barely hear anything in the background. There was times i had to take these off to actually hear what they\\u2019re saying. Probably one of the best i seen if you ask me.\\n\\nMic Monitoring 10/10 : Now let me get this straight. Ppl said the mic was terrible but they\\u2019re wrong . Let me tell you that this Mic sounds very crisp and clear. As far as i stated before with the noise cancellation ppl can barely hear anything in your background with this mic. So if you got a PS4 that sounds like an AC130 taking off this will cover it 100% and i also love the fact it\\u2019s w Clearcast mic which is why it\\u2019s even better. You can also use the Steelseries EQ Engine to adjust any of these features above to your liking weather you wanna tweak the sounds or the mic etc so that\\u2019s a W for Steelseries.\\n\\nOverall Review : These are definitely worth $100. I recommend anyone to get this if you\\u2019re struggling to get a good headset especially the more expensive premium ones. Although this headset does feel very premium if you ask me. You won\\u2019t be disappointed with this product at all. By far my new favorite headset along with Astros.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I've always been pleased with Steel Series headphones and the Arctis 1 wireless is another great example of why I continue to buy their products.\\n\\nThe feel and fitment on the head is very good. After 4-6 hours, there's no discomfort. Lots of room in the ear cups with a good amount of padding.\\nI use mine for gaming on the ps5. The battery life seems to be close enough to what they advertise. First time use was as simple as plugging the included dongle into the front of the ps5 and turning on the headphones. The sound quality is good and very well balanced. It's loud enough that I normally turn it down to around 60-70% volume. Didn't distort at max volume as well. It comes with 3 cables: A micro usb, usb-c to usb extension for the included dongle, and a 3.5 mm audio cable for headphone jacks.\\nCons:\\n-The micro usb charging port is very inconvenient and outdated.\\n-The ear cups are fabric and will be harder to clean.\\n-To turn the headphones on and off require you to press and hold the power button for several seconds each time. A simple switch would have been better.\\n-The overall style and design is kinda dull and nothing to write home about.\\nOverall, I'm satisfied with these headphones. If you want a no nonsense pair of headphones that are reliable and get the job done, these are worth considering.\",\n",

Its okay.\\n- the microphone's \\\"noise cancelling\\\" is also okay.\\n- the microphone does not noise cancel when things brush the microphone so do bear that in mind.\\n- the headsets range is about 40? Feet.\\n- the headset creeks and sounds like it's on the verge of breaking constantly and feels cheap\\n\\nPros!\\n- easy to setup and get working\\n- easy to use their basic app to setup an EQ\\n- once eq'd it sounds lovely\\n- ear pads are pretty much universal\\n- despite its creeking and cheap feel, it's tough as an ox\\n- it's 70ish dollars\\n- a better headset is significantly more than 70 dollars\\n- better headsets than are wireless break significantly easier and are not 70 dollars\\n- keeps out enough noise to ignore your surroundings but not enough that you can't hear what's going on\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I usually dont bother writing reviews, but this headset is so perfect that i just had to. I cant believe how well they fit, how comfortable they are right out of the box, and how amazing they sound. The crispness of the audio is evident right away. I have gone through many headsets. I had the X41 Turtle beaches, the stealth 600 gen 1 and gen 2 as well as other foreign gaming headsets that were supposedly great, and these blow all of them away in every category. They look great, the head band part is flexible so it wont break, the comfort is 10 our of 10, and most importantly the sound is so clear and you can always tell exactly what direction an enemy is coming from in shooter games. Another thing that i love about this headset is the wireless dongle they use. Instead of a USB, its a dongle that fits the Playstation, my computer, my laptop, and my Android phone. It just works the way its supposed to on every device. Also, the microphone is detachable too so you dont need to have it on all the time if you dont want to. They thought of everything with these headsets. And the battery lasts a long time as well. I will never buy another type of wireless gaming headset other than this. I believe it will last for years to come but that remains to be seen. You cant go wrong with these. 10 out of 10 overall from me.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Disclaimer: While I am a big headphones enthusiasts (have tried/owned many different pairs), this only my second gaming headset, as I have usually played video games through speakers. I previously had a cheap Turtle Beach set that I used for PS4 multiplayer games with friends and family. Since building a new gaming PC 4 months ago, I've been using headphones for gaming more often. I've also had to use headphones for work since my job has moved to WFH for the foreseeable future. My favorite cans are currently my modded Koss Pro DJ100 w/ a good amp (closed set) and the Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro (open set) which I also use for mixing/editing audio tracks. I bought these because I needed a wireless set for couch gaming when I run my PC into my TV.\\n\\nComfort & Looks: Arctis 1 = 4/5; Arctis 7 = 4.5/5\\nThe plastic finish and plain look are OK but not amazing. For $100 dollars the look and feel is totally serviceable. There are some rough-ish edges on the headband, but everything else is smooth. The clamping force is a little tight for me personally, but it's comfortable otherwise (not too hot, headband rests OK, can move around just fine, etc). My partner has a smaller head than me and they love the Arctis 1 so far with no complaints (it is now their main headphone for working and gaming). The Arctis 7 is excellent for me and the headband is very comfy. The clamping pressure is less but still allows for movement without falling off my head. I like the slightly cleaner look & feel of the 7, but the 1 is sturdy in its own right (if just a little rough).\\n\\nSound: Arctis 1 = 4/5; Arctis 7 = 4.5/5\\nThe sound on the Arctis 1 is quite good for a $100 wireless set (although not an audiophile set exactly). Definitely a mainstream gaming EQ curve (extra bass, slightly scooped mid). The details are fine and the soundstage works well with stereo effects in music or games (like enemies clunking around in FPS games). There's OK high extension but they're slightly attenuated. Mids are generally accurate but there seems to be more prominent low and high mids honestly. After EQing in the provided software I was able to quickly set up a couple profiles (gaming and music) that sounded good to me for general gaming and listening. The Arctis 7 isn't incredibly different although I feel it's a little more balanced and has better isolation. The soundstage also feels a little more realistic to me personally and it feels just a little more detailed. The surround sound is OK, but I'm honestly fine with stereo imaging.\\n\\nMic/Communication Functions: Arctis 1 = 3.5/5;Arctis 7 4/5\\nThe mic is decent (same microphone on both), but it has that constant compression and low dynamic range thing going on. It's perfectly serviceable for communicating in games (and work meetings, Zoom calls, etc.), but don't try to record vocals with it or anything like that. I've been using it to teach and my students say it sounds fine compared to my usual SM58 or AT2020 setup.I should note that the Arctis 7 has game chat mix in case you want to mix the level of chat mixed into your game. It's a nice feature if you play games where chat is useful. I also love that the mic on the Arctis 7 can be pushed back up into the ear cup.\\n\\nConnectivity & Battery: Arctis 1 =4.5/5; Arctis 7 = 3.5/5\\nGreat connectivity options on the Arctis 1, especially the USB-C dongle. So easy to switch between devices (including my phone) on the fly. The Arctis 7 has a traditional USB dongle with line in/line out 1/8' jacks. It's fine but less useful than the Arctis 1 dongle for me. The battery life is great on both and they charge back up pretty quickly as well.\\n\\nTLDR: Arctis 1 has higher clamping force, better overall connectivity, and it's rougher around the edges. The Arctis 7 is comfy, better built, and has better isolation and a tuck-away mic. I think the Arctis 7 sounds just slightly better, but they're both nice wireless headphones in their own right. If you have a small to average head and want to save $50, the Arctis 1 is great. If you want more polish, have a larger head, or want slightly better communications functionality, grab the Arctis 7.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I have been using this headset for a little over a week and would like to share my experience so far.\\n\\nPros:\\n-The sound quality is great\\n-The over ear design is comfortable\\n-The 'on headset' controls are very useful (volume control, mute/unmute microphone toggle)\\n-The microphone voice clarity is great\\n-I love that the microphone can be taken off when not in use so its not always in the way\\n-The 2.4ghz dongle is USB-C but the headset does come with a USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter. So i can use it with anything.\\n-The wireless range is great\\n-Zero audio latency is amazing\\n-Long battery life\\n-Works on all of my devices (most importantly my xbox since there are ZERO wireless headsets for xbox one for some reason)\\n\\nNow, with all of those great things about it that i have never seen another headset match, there are a few things about this headset that i found to be surprising problems in a headset that is so highly rated, loved, and priced.\\nAnd i do understand that some of the issues that i have with it are going to be very specific to me, and few people that struggle with the same unique traits that i do.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Low build quality in something that has a premium price.\\nWhen i pay $100 for a headset i expect it to be top of the line in the materials used to make it. But instead it is made out of very cheap feeling plastic that is very easy to break/bend. This makes the headset feel extremely ridged and like you constantly have to be careful with it. And i dont like having to worry about that when paying so much for it. When i pay a premium price, i should feel like i am holding a premium item.\\n-HEADACHES.\\nThis is one will will probably be pretty specific to me because i am VERY prone to headaches. But to put it plainly, the headset is so NON ADJUSTABLE that it squeezes my head VERY TIGHT in just the wrong way to cause me to get a lot of tension headaches. Not what i want in a headset that i intend to be wearing for 6+ hours a day. I have tried to pull on the headband portion to make it sit a little wider on my head in an effort to make it so its not squeezing my head so tightly but thats another situation where the poor build quality comes into play. When i try to pull on it the shell is so ridged that it cant change shape at all. it just starts to bend in a way that makes the cushion on top of your head pop out and starts to look like your about to do some permanent damage to the headset. So i am forced to deal with the headset squeezing my head a lot tighter than i would prefer.\\n-Its very heavy.\\nIve used a lot of different headsets in my life and im sure its partly because of the added weight from the battery.\\nBut regardless of that when i have the headset on, i feel like my head is significantly weighed down. Even when compared to other wireless headsets ive used. This also doesnt positively effect my headaches.\\n-I have to hold the power button for a frustratingly long time to either turn it on or off but most importantly to wake it up when it puts itself into sleep mode.\\nSomething as simple as a toggle switch instead of a press and hold button would completely fix this issue. Not sure whether its just straight up turning itself off when inactive for a few min or if its goes into some kind of sleep mode, either way it is surprising how much it bothers me to do things like leave my desk for 5 min and have to hold the power button down for 5+ seconds before i can hear anything again. This wouldnt annoy me as much if i didnt have to do it so often, Im working from home and helping my wife with our newborn baby so i have to pause things and be away from my desk for a few min quite frequently throughout the day. This results in me spending a cumulative 5+ min of my day just holding the power button on my headset which can get pretty annoying.\\n-Not made for people with smaller heads.\\nThis is a large headset. Not the ear pieces themselves necessarily, its the head band thats the issue. At its smallest setting, it barely fits my head, and thats if i learn to ignore it still sitting on the top of my ears. Dont know if its just my short forehead or if its my big ears, probably a combination of both, either way as a full grown adult i should have to extend the headband portion ever so slightly, not have to deal with it being to big at its smallest setting. I used headsets like this when i was playing games at the age of 12 when my head was a lot smaller. And most pro gamers now days ARE younger, how is this headset supposed to cater to them when it doesnt fit the head of an adult?\\n\\nAll in all, It is a very good headset. And if you have no problems with headaches, have a larger head, and are able to be very careful with the headset and dont have any kids around it EVER, then this headset will serve all of your needs and more extremely well.\\nPersonally i still have a few weeks before i reach the return deadline so i am going to see if i can just get used to the issues that i have with it or adapt to them. Its a good and unique enough headset that i feel as though i will struggle to find another one that can do everything that i love about this headset.\\nSo i will give it a couple more weeks and update this review as to whether the issues i have with it can be overcome.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"I've owned this headset for about a year now. I'm not a pro gamer, I'm no tech wiz, just a casual.\\n\\nPros:\\nThe sound quality is quite good.\\nThe versatility of use is great. Getting to move the plug in to so many different devices is quite handy.\\n\\nMid:\\nThe range. It has maybe a 10' range. I have an open concept house, and when I get up to get a drink or something with my headset, inevitably I start hearing these annoying beeps warning me that I'm put of range.\\n\\nCons:\\nThe microphone. It's one of the worst audio captures I've ever heard. Whether I'd have the mic a few inches away, right against my mouth, or anywhere in between, it always sounded like I was 30' away from the thing. It sounded like the only thing it was trying to capture was the room tone. Just awful.\\n\\nI'm very torn on whether I'd buy another SteelSeries headset.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"Like I said, I'm definitely no expert in headphones but I did a little bit of research before I bought these in the good ol 2023 and it seems like they still held up pretty well in comparison to other headphones.\\n\\nSo I really like these. The mobility of wireless headphones is really nice, and they're not uncomfortable. My previous headphones had been a pair of craply Beats and in comparison I enjoy the audio from these a lot better and I am able to pick up more audio details in things like Valorant.\\n\\nI really enjoy the volume wheel on the headphones as a streamer. Sometimes I need to crank audio too loud for my sensitive ears and with my old headphones I was struggling between my auditory comfort and making sure things are audible and balanced in stream.\\n\\nMy only issue is that I legitimately have no idea how loud I'm talking with these on and that the low battery beep stresses me out, lol.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Let me first start out by saying I am a casual gamer. I've been playing Xbox One for the last few years and decided to get this head set for that particular gaming system. This is a great gaming headset! I upgraded from my Turtle Beach headset that served me very well for many years. Here is what I liked and did not like about the Astro A50.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nGreat sound: Customizable pre-sets and default presets make this headset ideal for those that want to tweak their headset settings. You can easily adjust settings on this headset by using the free Astro app on any Windows PC or Apple OS computer. You can also select one of three headsets loaded on the headset by simply pushing the preset button. This cycles through three presets on the headset (1-3).\\n\\nGreat feel: This headset is lightweight. You can easily wear this for 8+ hours during those long gaming sessions and still not get fatigued by wearing it. While the headset is lightweight it is still built very very well and feel solid. You won't feel like you can easily break this headset which for the price point is a good thing. The headset also does not pinch or make my head uncomfortable in anyway and if measured out I have a large head.\\n\\nWireless: The headset is 100% wireless. The only time you will need to have the headset docked is for charging. There is no cables to get in the way between you and the gaming controller or the gaming console. The freedom is nice. With the wireless capabilities also comes outstanding range. When wearing the headset I can literally go to any area of my apartment and still hear voice and game sounds. It's also nice not being tethered to your controller or console. If you've never experience true wireless gaming this will be mind blowing for you--it was for me.\\n\\nMic: While some reviews have posted complaints about the mic quality I have had really no issues with the mic. I am careful with it and raise and lower it with ease as to not damage the mechanism. The mic is turned on and off by raising and lowering. Up is in the off/mute position and down is in the on/voice position. No complaints from anyone in my gaming party on not being able to hear me either. You may need to carefully bend the end of the mic inward to your face a bit for best results. Keep in mind that if you do this the mic will hit the headset in the off/mute position so be careful not to damage it. While it would be nice to have a switch to tap to turn the mic on or off it is also nice to have the mic up out of the way for those solo gaming sessions or if you don't feel like being social during a particular gaming session.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nAdjusting in game and voice chat volume: While there is a \\\"rocker switch\\\" to adjust game and voice chat sound it is often confusing and I find myself constantly looking to see which way I should push the switch to adjust either the game volume or voice chat volume. This is especially true if I don't use the headset for several weeks between gaming sessions. Again, I am a casual gamer so this is my experience. Opinions on this will vary!\\n\\nOverall volume: It is nice to be able to easily raise or lower overall sound volume. This is game volume and voice chat volume. The downside to the particular way this headset's volume control works is that it's on a round dial. This dial is too easily manipulated especially if you are resting in a reclined position. I find myself inadvertently lowering the volume in the middle of a gaming session and then I need to remove one hand from the gaming controller to re-adjust the volume control. This is a drawback to the design but not a deal breaker. If you never game in a reclined position you very well may never experience an issue with this!\\n\\nOverall this is light years ahead of any basic headset and even more advanced in many ways over the competitors top end headset models. If you are a serious or casual gamer this is a headset that you should check-out and you'll probably realize that this is the route to go.\\n\\nThanks for reading!\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"The headset works extremely well with my Xbox series s. It connects smoothly every time and I have not had one issue with the connection. The battery life is the best I\\u2019ve experienced. Also these are really comfortable. I will have them on for hours at a time and won\\u2019t feel any discomfort. Great product and would recommend to anyone.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Bought this headset June 22nd, 2021. Within a month or so, I started noticing that it would make clicking and staticky noises (harsh enough to feel like it's damaging my hearing) here and there, seemingly randomly, and would occasionally cut out the audio altogether, anywhere from a split second to me having to reset my bas station manually. Because I'm such a good customer, I tried finding solutions online before contacting ASTRO, because I thought for sure the issue was on my end and I could fix it. But nothing worked.\\n\\nSo I contacted ASTRO for help in early August, and they gave me a list of options to try. I spent many hours over two or three weeks testing and trying to fix the issue, but none of them worked. I read the manufacturer warranty and, from what I remember, it said I could get it repaired, replaced, or refunded within a year for faulty parts or whatever.\\n\\nSo in late August I contacted them again to tell them nothing worked and I'm having the same issues, and requested a replacement. Instead of fulfilling my request, they simply gave me more options to try and fix it, but after so many hours of testing, I told them I was not interested in testing it further, since I had zero confidence anything would work. Instead of replacing everything, they sent a new base station.\\n\\nTook 1-2 weeks for the base station to arrive in the mail, which I received somewhere in mid September. Tested it a bunch, just like before, didn't make any difference. Contacted them back once again on October 1st to finally just replace the headset itself, as I was certain at this point it was an issue with the headset, especially since I read some reviews and questions on Amazon that mentioned the same issues I'm having. Luckily they complied right away and started the process of returning my headset and shipping a new one, but as expected I had to send mine in first.\\n\\nTook about three weeks to finally get the replacement headset in late October after extensive shipping delays. Tested it out a bit, no change. Still making all the same obnoxious, harmful noises the previous headset did. By now, I've realized the clicks and the static aren't as random as I thought, and seem to happen when certain sounds are played. It's hard to explain, but basically it can happen in any game I play or YouTube video I watch, but certain sounds trigger it more often. For instance, it happens frequently when playing Battlefield 1 multiplayer, but not as much in Jurassic World: Evolution; it's consistently worse in BF1, but still unbearable when it happens in JW:E. This only cemented my belief that the headset is faulty.\\n\\nAt this point I just decided it wasn't worth it anymore and I'd just get a refund for it, and maybe switch to wired headsets to avoid wireless issues. Got a response pretty quick telling me they don't do refunds past 30 days, but I can totally just send them back my $300 headset without a refund. No mention whether they would replace it again or anything, just \\\"feel free to send it back\\\", as if I would just \\\"donate\\\" my faulty $300 headset back to them for nothing in return.\\n\\nNever had these issues with the Turtle Beach headset I used for the 5 years prior. Only with the ASTRO A50 headset. They look and feel premium, but in practice they sound cheap as dirt. Now I seriously regret my decision to buy from ASTRO, let alone not returning it for a full refund immediately once I started having issues. Never buying from ASTRO ever again.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I've had an Astro a40 wired gaming headset for years so I was already familiar with the brand. $300 is a lot to spend on something so do your research and read the reviews both positive and negative. My personal experience is 100% positive.\\n\\nI wanted them solely for my PC since the a40's are in a different area of the room hooked up to the Xbox/Playstation/TV and having to unhook and reconnect every time I want to use the headphones is a hassle. Setting the a50's up to the PC took less than 30 seconds. Seriously. I simply connected the micro-usb to the base, connected the USB end to a free slot on my PC tower, turned the headphones on and viola! Windows 10 recognized the plug and play of a set of headphones and I was up and going in less than a minute. (Granted I made sure the toggle on the base was set to \\\"PC\\\" before I plugged everything in and turned it on)\\n\\nSound quality is excellent. Just what I expected from a set of $300 astro gaming headphones. If you want to say anything on the mic, you just swing the arm down and it unmutes. Swing it back if you want to mute. Easy. Now, they are a wee bit tight when you first put them on but give it a good session of gaming and you'll be fine. You can adjust the volume by either using the dial on the right side of the headset or simply changing the volume via your PC controls.\\n\\nBattery life is advertised at being 15 hours of life before it needs a charge. I was able to use it for a few hours right out of the box. The charging base tells you how much battery life you have left via the 4 lighted squares on the base (see pic). I haven't used up all the juice yet and it has seemed to hold up nicely. The charging is super easy. The headset will sit on the base and if charging is initiated the squares will light up and indicate how much charge the battery has by how many lights are shown. Just charge them after you get done using them (like you would with your phone) and you'll be ready to go the next time you want to use them.\\n\\nSome additional features include: the cloth ear cups are removeable if you want to clean them or purchase the mod kit that has leather ear cups. Astro provides a free 2 year license of Dolby Atmos for headphones which is useful for all of those Call of Duty players.\\n\\nRange is VERY nice. With other wireless headsets you have a range at which you can walk away from the receiver before you lose the signal. I was able to walk three rooms away and go outside before I started to notice signal loss. That is about 50' (15m) through walls and around corners. *Just make sure you mute before you go to the bathroom*\\n\\n$300 is a lot to throw down for a nice pair of headphones. But these are worth the price.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"This is a great headset with two cons: 1) Incredibly uncomfortable. Purchased a $15 leather headset pad that did the trick, but that shouldn't be necessary when paying $300 for a headset. 2) Overpriced. $220 would be fair. However, I'm alright paying $300 due to the performance increase over headsets in the $120 range. As for pros: pretty much everything else. Sound quality is very good, mic is very good, and charging base is unnecessary but rather cool and very good. You can charge while playing which is good, flip mic to silence which is good as well, and if you last them down they turn off, and then turn back on when picked up. Overall they're worth it if you have the money to spend. If you're unsure of spending that much and would rather go with something in the $100 range: grab a pair of Corsairs. Not as high of quality, but better bang for your buck.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"As you can tell from the title I wear glasses while gaming and they can cause some discomfort during longer gaming sessions with certain headphones. Not the case with these, I was surprised how well they accommodate them. Do I feel the pressure eventually, yes. But this isn't until many hours in and it is only slight. Besides that the audio quality is excellent, the software for audio adjustment is fairly user friendly, and the various buttons/settings on the headset are very useful.\\n\\nMy only drawbacks are slight, but to be thorough: the base/dock for charging can be a bit finnicky when it comes to lining up the pins correctly between the headset and the base. Also the aesthetics are not exactly my taste, but I don't stream so I don't care at all what it looks like on my head as long as it's comfortable and functional.\\n\\nIn short, it's definitely a bit pricey but in my opinion you get everything you are paying for.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"(I'm using these for PC.) first things first, out of the box. These headphones sound TERRIBLE! but worry not! download the astro command center app (the reviews for the app are all 1 star for some reason. but I had no issues with it.) then download the dolby access app. Use both of these apps to adjust all levels. There are some video's online you can use as a reference for the best settings. ALSO! keep in mind these headphones have 2 overall settings. Voice and game. Which you can adjust on the fly by the big side buttons on the right earcup. Setting it more toward voice will make voices crystal clear but will LOWER the game volume and over levels. On the flip side, set it to game to get the best out of your gaming sound. Once you have it set up right. These headphones sound AMAZING. They are super lightweight. Super comfortable. And disappear on your head. I'm moving from Audio-Technica ath-m50x over to these. And these sound better. If that gives you any idea how good it is.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"Let me start with I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES! That may sound contradictory to the header but, there are a few issues that took literal months for me to solve that make these headphones not worth the stress at this price point.\\n\\nTrying to update the drivers on these headphones to make them compatible with consoles is a chore, they aren't ready to play for consoles out of the box without a PC [Which I have and use them on] They only work for PC. The software itself for updating the drivers doesn't work. At least the Microsoft store version which is the version that downloads from most links they give you. THEIR version of the software does work but requires searching for the drivers manually and installing them manually.\\n\\nAnd finally, the top cushion that rests on the top of the user's head constantly popped off for me, to the point where now I have fastened it in place with electrical tape, it's still comfortable but I shouldn't have to tape a $300 headset out of the box.\\n\\nTL;DR: This headset is not worth this price for the out-of-box maintenance go get something newer from this company or a different company entirely.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Love the headset itself, very comfortable even with glasses on. My only complaint is the little head cushion piece did pop out and won't stay when I try to pop it back in. I've had these for about a week. For a $300 headset, you'd think they would address this issue. I've seen many other reviews stating the same thing. I superglued it into place and have had no further issues with it. It doesn't bother me because it's an easy fix. But for a $300 headset, I think the build quality could be improved.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"The sound quality and noise cancelation is fantastic. I use this almost daily and the mic does not pic up any ambient noise and is great. I use this for games where sound is significant.\\n\\nThe battery has a long life and the docking station is great and easy to use.\\n\\nThe only negative thing I have to say is I wish the game sound and voice sound is toggle to switch. This limits the options of changing the balance on the fly. You can still adjust in settings.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"1 - AMBIDEXTROUS. First of all, I want to say thank you Logitech for making this ambidextrous to the point it is optimal for left handed use. Thanks to a physical condition, I can only use mouses left handed. There is very few options for people who can only use mouses left handed for gaming, and times are looking grim due to recent news regarding left handed mices. Thankfully, ambidextrous designs exist, and I can easily say that this is THE BEST mouse for left handed users, even better than my previous mouse. I hope to see ambidextrous designs continue down the line, and also bonus points for allowing brief customization that allows it to be a left-handed mice.\\n\\n2 - PERFORMANCE. Anyways, I've been using this mouse for almost three months now. Its quite clear that I'm more than satisfied with this mouse, and its not just because its ambidextrous. The wireless performance for this mouse has been on point. I've yet to catch mouse lag. Granted, its only been a few months, but it has shown an equivalence of wired mice performance. At first I was skeptical, but not only has this mice proven to me that its as good as wired mices, it has also made wired mices feel like an annoyance to the point where I don't think I could go back to wired mices. Its hard for something to get in the way thanks to how open the mice is, on top of it being pretty damn light. Using this mice is a breeze. So yeah, this mice is on point on wireless performance, and takes advantage of the benefits of wireless mices.\\n\\n3 - BATTERY LIFE. I will flat out say that the battery life is as good as said. One of the obvious flaws of wireless mices is that they need to be charged. Thankfully, depending on lighting settings, it can last for quite a long time, to the point I forget this mice even needs to be charged. With my current setting, it can last over 60 hours. Logitech has done an amazing job minimizing the flaws of wireless in this mouse.\\n\\n4 - DURABILITY. Its only been a few months since I've used this. Although I've yet to get my mouse into a breaking point, I've developed a bad habit of hitting the side of my keyboard with the top end of my mouse. Despite doing it at times I don't even notice even scratches on the mice. So far, its holding although I've only used this for just a few months.\\n\\n5 - FLAWS?. If there is anything I don't really like about this mice, its the awkward setup. More specifically the end of the cable having a claw-like design. It seemed weird at first, but its as basic as it can get.\\n\\n6 - FINAL THOUGHTS. At first I was somewhat afraid due to the mouse size and the price. My hand is 21x11 cm, and so far I found this mice comfortable. As for price, even though it is $150, I was willing to pay premium just for a good mice for left-handed use. It accommodates for me, it was an upgrade for me, and I am more than happy with this mice alone. There were also comments regarding left and right click overlapping, but that was not the case for my mouse, and this was more of an issue for older G Pro Wireless mices. Wasn't an issue for me which I got in October.\\n\\nOverall, I personally LOVE this mice. Amazing wireless performance on top of maximizing the benefits and does its best minimizing the flaws of wireless. The ambidextrous design is phenomenal and a dream as a left-handed user. if I could rate it higher than 5/5, I would. Thank you, Logitech.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I am a die hard Logitech fan when it comes to peripherals, been using a mice, keyboards, and headsets from them for years now. I was a very big fan of the g403 and bought a few wired ones as well one wireless. I broke most of them as I used to rage but was especially a fan of the wireless, Logitech knows how to do wireless. I always kept the weight in the mouse so I am more used to heavier mice. Because of this I was somewhat nervous to try a lighter mouse, I wanted to try the superlight but I read reviews of more problems with that one, and with the price tag and larger jump in weight difference I thought the regular G pro wireless was the right choice. When I first got it took a bit of getting used to because I would put more effort into my flicks because I was used to more weight, but it didn't take long.\\n\\nThe build quality is very good as always with Logitech in my experience, I have had no issues with ghosting, double clicks etc. The ergonomics are similar to the g403 but different on the sides. The stock sliders are pretty good and I don't think I personally need to change them, although I am not that picky when it comes to that. The scroll wheel has a bit more feedback than the g403 which is good because that mouse had almost none. The mouse buttons are more clicky, lighter and feel more responsive than the g403. The side buttons are smaller but also more clicky, but also stick out more than those on the g403 which makes it easier to engage. The logo is a customizable LED which you can change or turn in the G Hub (great app btw), the scroll wheel no longer is. The sensor is much more precise than the prodigy sensor that I am used to, which was still good, but not close to this one. It also has a larger DPI range than before, which I don't use but its cool I guess. It does not have a DPI switch button on the top anymore, but has one on the bottom, which again I do not use as I have always had it disabled, but is nice to have if I need it. You can also charge this mouse wirelessly via mousepad or some other setup, and can add a weight if you desire to do so. I was very surprised at the battery life on this thing. It was good on my previous wireless mouse but this thing only needs to be charged every week at the most for me. When you turn it on out of rest mode it has LED dots that tell you generally how charged the battery is, but you can also check the G Hub app or it will tell you when it is getting low as a little pop up at the bottom right of your screen. It came with a charging cable that was unbraided so I just used my old g403 braided charging cable as it still fits the micro-usb port. It will not come out when charging and playing and will not change the responsiveness which is really good for wireless. I keep mine on my bungie for quick access and so that I don't notice the wire when using the mouse. This mouse is also ambidextrous so leftys can also use it by swapping out the buttons on the side as it comes setup for right handed users.\\n\\nLogitech is really ahead of the game and has sort of set themselves apart from the competition in the recent years when it comes to wireless gaming, there is not any lag or delay and it is just as responsive as a wired mouse. Wireless is the future and I'm all for it. This is by no means the cheapest mouse, I got it on a deal and still spent a good amount. But it is great for the money, and definitely a competitive gaming mouse that will give you an edge. I think it's great and Logitech has never let me down, so if you're interested in it, and are willing to spend the money on it I say you should go for it and you won't be let down.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I have been using this mouse for almost two weeks and am very glad I made the purchase. My previous mouse was the Logitec G502 Hero, which is also a phenomenal mouse. The G502 Hero is a much cheaper alternative, but it is wired. The G502 Lightspeed has the same great sensor, but it has a few more buttons and is just a little heavier.\\n\\nThat being said, there was a small break-in period for me while using the mouse. For the first few days, it felt too uncontrollable. You'd be surprised how much of an impact a wire will cause on your mouse's feel. The drag of the wire being gone was alone a big thing to get used to. This mouse is also lighter which added to the feeling. After a week of daily usage, it feels MUCH better, even better than my last mouse.\\n\\nThis mouse also has fewer buttons than the G502, but sometimes less is more! It has the primary buttons you need for FPS games.\\n\\nPROS:\\n- Easy setup. Just install Logitech G Hub for customization.\\n- Great battery life with very quick charging.\\n- Great for large hands using claw grip.\\n\\nCONS:\\n- Price\\n- Fewer buttons than G502 but you won't miss them after the break-in period\\n- Small break-in period if moving from heavier mice.\\n\\nOverall solid mouse. 10/10 overall, but only getting a 4 star in the Ergonomic category since the stock pads are not as good as aftermarket alternatives, but they are still very usable.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"*UPDATE* I received my new mouse and have had zero issues for a while now. Incredible mouse. I have to say I'm incredibly satisfied this thing goes as long as it does without requiring a charge up. If you can avoid the defects, this mouse can only be improved upon by an ergonomic choice by the players.\\n\\nThat is to say, if you want something more from this mouse, it would be your subjective taste in how a mouse feels in your hands that would affect your selection. Hand size, grip style, and posture will be the biggest determinant. If you like ambidextrous ergonomics or palm grip, this is about as sublime as it gets for snappy flicks. Very stable tracking for continuous movement of the mouse as you maneuver around an angle. Great responsiveness, but I do feel that \\\"break-in\\\" time with this mouse is longer than most that I owned. I can pick up most mouses and after a few days of DM be completely comfortable with a mouse. This one took weeks, but it rewards you with a really good sensation.\\n\\nIt's how I imagine it feels when a runner finds the right running shoe. Maybe a better comparison is upgrading to a better headset. You can \\\"tell\\\" this one is different and somehow better, it just doesn't feel comfortable in the same way a new leather shoe is a little stiff when you're breaking them in. If you can afford to try this mouse, get it.\\n\\n----Old Review----\\n\\nI honestly wished I was 1 of the 65% of people who purchase these mice and had zero issues with it. The first three days of using this mouse were sublime. I'm a competitive Counter-Strike player. Which means I'm very opinionated about my computer accessories. I have the 240 Hz Monitor, the loud clacky mechanical keyboard, and mousepad that covers half my table. I also happen to have roughly ten different e-sports mice. For me, I tend to go through them rather quickly. I buy them to see if the newer ones have better sensors and to experience the \\\"hand feel\\\" of the mouse. If they don't make me happy, it tends to sit in my drawer for the occasional LAN party when the console plebs want to experience the beautiful game.\\n\\nThe problem with this mouse is very minute but like any papercut. Papercuts tend to chip away at your sanity until you explode in a fit of rage at this minor inconvenience. This mouse double clicks. That is LITERALLY the only issue with it.\\n\\nNow, I understand this sounds a little crazy. However, you need to realize that this is a review created from a series of hilarious coincidences that have convinced me that my mouse is cursed. I don't care if a regular mouse double-clicked. I am quite certain if this mouse was in my office at work. I wouldn't care. Yeah, it pauses the video right when you click to play them. It mysteriously resizes windows when you're trying to move them. Those are minor inconveniences.\\n\\nHowever, I have never been so thoroughly trolled by a mouse in my life when it comes to Counter-Strike. It has rendered me absolutely useless with grenades. Counter-Strike has these things called executes. Which usually requires the entire team of players to synchronize grenade throws to surprise the other side with our cool use of grenades. I am often accused of purposely losing rounds because of this mouse. I cannot seem to hold a grenade in my avatar's hand before I immediately throw it at where ever I happen to look. Which in some cases are the backs of my teammates or an entrance we have to run through.\\n\\nSo what are the benefits? I'm far more accurate with this mouse. This mouse is incredibly precise. You can repeat the same motion of flicking the mouse a certain distance, and you will always turn at that radius. It gives a very snappy response, and there's no strange \\\"glide\\\" feeling like a razer mouse. It should be like this for an esports mouse, especially for shooters. However, the fact this is a wireless mouse, and I can't emphasize this enough, the fact I can't tell the difference from this mouse and Zowie mice is remarkable.\\n\\nI have avoided wireless mice for a long time due to issues with lag and inconsistency in my mechanics while using one. The higher the refresh rate of your monitor, delay in wireless mice is magnified. So consistency is essential for me. I never once thought, the reason I lost an aim duel was due to this mouse. It never failed to do its job. It felt natural. Remember I have ten mice I could switch back at any moment. I didn't even want to consider going back. That's how good it felt to use this thing.\\n\\nI'm going to take my chances with replacing the current mouse and pray I don't have another one with this issue. If I don't have any further issues, I will update this review.\",\n",

            "        \"6\": \"So lets get this out of the way, why not 5 stars. The only reason I'm not giving this mouse 5 stars is because the profile/settings are not stored on the hardware itself. Logitech software must be running for RGB profile as well as resolution setting. The mouse has a default RGB setting and DPI. This is my first wireless mouse, so maybe that is the reason? My previous wired mice Razer and Corsair brand seemed to keep their profile.\\n\\nCharging:\\n\\nI don't have the charging mat to go with this mouse, but I don't find it a hassle to charge. Pretty convenient using the cable they provide which the USB dongle can attach to. I try to swap them out once a week just to make sure it always has a charge.\\n\\nHand-feel:\\n\\nI have fairly large hands (6'2\\\" is my height), the size was a little concerning for me as I've always purchased large mice. I like it though, it weighs next to nothing, especially compared to the last few mice I've used. The only other minor gripe I have with this mouse is that I tend to have my pinky on the ground when I play. There are times when I flick right (I'm right handed) and the fat on my pinky goes under the mouse bringing up the right edge of the mouse off the table. The mouse basically must have full contact to operate and I have noticed at times, not just flicking, but panic tracking, that the mouse is non-responsive because it is just a few MMs off the table. I've been trying to adjust how I hold the mouse which always alleviates the issue, and I could probably benefit from better mouse-posture anyway, so I can't really consider this in my star-rating.\\n\\nSoftware:\\n\\nIMO Razer has the absolute best software for my needs. The Logitech software seems good, I'll need more time and play more variety of games to really see if it checks all the boxes for me though. I've been fairly casual since I got this mouse, Ark Survival Evolved, Rust, Icarus, Among Us, pretty much all things that only require default functionality, no MMO play yet.\\n\\nRandom thoughts:\\n\\nWhat happened to the day when we'd add weights to our mice? I think part of it is the popularity of quick-action shooters such as Valorant. You can't flick with a boulder. I purchased this mouse because I really like the game Rust, a popular Rust streamer, spoonkid, plugged this mouse during one of his streams and I wanted to check it out. I tell you what, I went from a rock on the beach to AK in half the time with this mouse. j/k I still suck at Rust, but that's on me.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Let me start off by saying that this mouse is absolutely FANTASTIC! I have been using it for nearly a week now and have already fallen in love. Before this mouse, I used a Hyperx pulsefire haste, which is around 60 grams and is pretty good, but It started acting up only after a year of ownership. This mouse weights about 20 grams more but doesn't feel like it, the weight is balanced so well that it feels like an ultra-lightweight mouse, and the battery life is incredible especially if you turn off the RGB (you can do this in the Logitech G Hub software). I'm predicting around 7-10 days of use, using it around 8 hours a day. The build quality is pretty good and the mouse is extremely comfortable, the scroll wheel is tactile while also not feeling \\\"crunchy\\\" and the buttons all feel top tier. The tracking is also exceptional and I have not experienced any issues with the sensor. There are 5 DPI settings by default, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and 6400 which can be swapped by using the button on the bottom of the mouse. You can make your own profile in the Logitech G Hbu software and set your DPI anywhere between 100 and 25600. You can also change the polling rate in this software, the 4 options are 1000, 500, 250, and 125 hz. I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone who is in the market for an extremely comfortable, well-balanced, and reliable mouse.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"Logitech has done an outstanding job manufacturing a wireless competitive gaming mouse. I personally will never be sold on the idea of a wireless mouse being better than a wired one just because of signal interference alone, this does not detract from the fact that this mouse is indeed a dam good mouse even for fast pace FPS shooters. I will try to go in order writing my review of this mouse from opening to playing with it.\\n\\n*Packaging*\\n\\nFor a $150 mouse I expected more from the packaging however I do understand that maybe Logitech wanted to keep things simple. There is no wow factor here just a simple small box wrapped in plastic. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn't be able to tell this thing costs$150.\\n\\n*Opening*\\n\\nSo once I got into the box that looks as though the contents of it didn't cost $150, I was once again taken aback. Reason being that the mouse was just sitting there unwrapped. The reason this kinda surprised me was because I had to make sure that I didn't accidentally order a used mouse. Nothing against used electronics but I generally stay away from them because they could potentially have unseen underlying issues, however Amazon and their generous return policy has restored some of my confidence in buying them but I did not want to go that route with this mouse at this price point. The mouse did have tape on the underside once I lifted it from its cradle but again I did double check to make sure that it wasn't a used product. I removed the tape from the underside and checked the mouse skates for any signs of scratches and everything was cool.\\n\\n*Package Contents*\\n\\nThe package contained what you'd expect. The mouse, a wireless dongle, and a cord all wrapped and in good condition. One thing that concerned me that I wasn't sure about was whether or not the buttons on the right side of the mouse were preinstalled and to my relief they weren't. The reason I say this is because I prefer not to disassemble my electronics if I don't have to, if you have to then you gotta do what you gotta do but I work in maintenance and repeatedly taking something apart and putting it back together causes excessive wear and damage and I'd prefer keeping my $150 mouse in pristine condition other than normal wear and tear.\\n\\n*The Mouse*\\n\\nThe mouse itself felt great, it felt solid and sound. The shell was sturdy I'm a heavy handed individual and I was comfortable applying normal pressures from my hands to the mouse with fear or it being damaged or broken. The mouse slides gracefully across the mouse pad out of the box so you won't encounter issues there, I would've preferred they used the mouse skates Razer has been using on their largest mice but it is what it is I ordered some Hyperglides to replace them.\\n\\n*Installation*\\n\\nSo the mouse is plug & play, I already had G Hub installed and the software recognized the hardware no problem. I didn't have to update any firmware or anything so that was cool I just plugged the dongle into the computer and turned the mouse on from the bottom and it was good to go.\\n\\n*The feels*\\n\\nSo I have large hands and going into this I expected it to be small for my hands and I was correct. I use somewhat of a palm claw hybrid and I found that I had some empty space between my hand and the mouse itself which is kinda like a dead zone and could cause slop when making fast movements. Like I said I anticipated this going in so I can't say I'm disappointed. The side buttons are nice as well as far as where they are positioned and how they feel when you press them, they're very responsive. My only gripe would really be to move them back a little but I attribute that to the size of the mouse itself if the mouse was a little larger they'd naturally be further back. The button position in relation to the size of the mouse is fine and about where you'd expect them to be. The two main mouse buttons feel pretty good as well the clicks sound good and feel equally as good I had no double click issues or indications thereof. One thing to really look out for are people buying this product used from someone else who had the double click issue and sending it back then someone else buys the mouse again with the same problem and all of a sudden a lot of people end up sharing the same mouse with the same issue leaving the same review complaining about the same problem. I've encountered no double click issue so far. The weight of the mouse itself is great as well it feels really balanced not too light but not too heavy.\\n\\n*Tracking*\\n\\nSo this is where the rubber meets the road, I wanted to test just how good this mouse is and if it's as good as they say it is. I tried this thing out not in Microsoft word or nothing like that I went straight to Apex Legends and COD. I went into G Hub to check my configurations and much to my surprise I didn't have to do anything another good thing about G Hub is that your settings apply universally to all Logitech mice so because I had profiles set up for one mouse they assumed it'd be the same for this one so that was a good surprise. The mouse tracked very well I have to admit I was impressed for a wireless mouse that didn't fit my hands that well I performed amicably and even was champion a few games and I'm not one to argue with results. The mouse tracked even my most minute movements without skipping a beat.\\n\\n*Conclusion*\\n\\nI was on the fence about even picking up a wireless mouse because I wasn't sure if the technology was really ready for competitive gaming but it has come a long way. My only real issue with wireless is the batteries, no matter how good the battery may be eventually it will wear out and turn your wireless mouse back into a wired one Logitech could circumvent this by making the battery removable but they'd sell less mice in doing so. Which leads me to the reason I chose Logitech over Razer because I've had to trash a wireless mouse once already in the past granted the technology back then isn't what it was today. I'll hold on to the mouse because I like it and it performs it will be the one in the arsenal. I've attached some photos of the mouse alongside some more other popular mice in the game for size comparison. Enjoy.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"So I have small hands, and I came from the wired Razer Viper Mini because I wanted to go wireless to get rid of the cable drag sensation. The G Pro compared to the Viper Mini is heavier and bigger, so it was hard to handle initially, but I eventually got used to it. If you have bigger hands or are used to using bigger mice, this will be great for you - you won't have to go through an adjustment period. I think for my next upgrade I'll go for the G Pro X Superlight. I'm a lower sens FPS player so the lighter the better, but I'd still recommend the G Pro for competitive FPS gaming if you want a higher end gaming mouse, but don't wanna break the bank too much.\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"***Update: I had originally given these 3 stars per below, but after more time I've updated it to 5... The battery life and wireless range is phenomenal, both are so much better than my previous Corsairs! I was charging those daily, after only about 4-5 hours I'd get low battery warnings, but I almost never have to charge these, it's insane how long they last... and the range is almost twice what I got from the Corsairs, I can roam all over and never lose sound! So just be sure to tweak the sound a bit as I noted before, and maybe about $15 of the price is simply for the brand name, but I'm liking these more and more with time!\\n\\nInitial Review:\\n\\nOk, I'm really torn on these... First things first: myself, along with many others, think the sound quality is horrible out of the box! People that say they sound great I don't think have experience with more expensive headphones and are probably moving up from $30 cheapos...\\n\\nFirst thing: After scouring Reddit and some trial and error, turn off all the special sound settings (like DTS and advanced settings) and move the bass to +7 and the treble to +4. After I made this change, the quality was much much better!\\n\\nI previously had Corsair HS70s for two years and HS80s for two years, but I hate the iCue software Corsair uses, it's a ridiculous resource hog and constantly has issues. So for me this is actually a mild downgrade price-wise as you read my pros and cons, they're primarily vs my Corsairs:\\n\\nPros: Incredibly lightweight and very comfortable. Battery lasts absolutely forever (I had to charge my Corsairs daily; the Logitech can go for days!). Sound is adequate once tweaked. Volume tops off at a low level but as a 45-year-old who is a huge music fan I can tell my ears aren't what they once were, so they're doing this for your protection. Software is \\\"light-weight\\\" and unobtrusive.\\n\\nCons: If you're mainly listening to music, spend a bit more on Corsair or Steelseries or even a purely audiophile set. You'll be disappointed with these. They're lightweight but as a downer feel a bit flimsy. As I said, sound is terrible out of the box imo.\\n\\nI really struggled with the number of stars to give! For the money, if you know you're getting a lightweight pair of headphones with great battery and no hassle, they're not bad at all. If you want more quality to your sound, go elsewhere however. A little bit more money can get you a way better sound.\\n\\nAs for Logitech in general, I was tired of having three different programs (keyboard, mouse, headphones) so also got a Logitech mouse after remembering one I loved years back. The brand does feel overpriced for the quality they provide, as a general rule, as if they're capitalizing off their brand. I'm ok with both these and the mouse, they're fine, but for just $20-40 more each I'd say try one of the newer brands if you haven't before. The Logitech stuff just feels cheaper overall than the price would suggest but they get the job done!\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I wanted something with a little range so I could putter about my home without the crackle and pop of a faltering signal. I've been burned before on a pair of Logitech G533's that absolutely would not hold a charge nor connect wirelessly, so figured I'd take a chance on a different model.\\n\\nI've not had them for long at all, in fact I've only had them for the one day, and will update my review if needed, but I immediately charged them and put them through a 10-hour run and so far I'm impressed. These were plug and play, worked and connected instantly, and I can listen to PC audio through these anywhere in my home. Granted it's a smaller place, so not much of an ask, but I'm just so glad I can listen to whatever or voice chat using the optional mic (though at my desk I use a Blue Yeti mic) while putting food together or slapping art materials together in another room.\\n\\nThese look great with the white/aluminum corsair mechanical LED keyboard I recently acquired as well. Love that clean-and-colorful look! Will probably match all my peripherals to it whenever they need replacing.\\n\\nThese are not strictly noise canceling but they actually do a good job of muffling the background noise anyway, which helps in concentrating on what I'm listening to. Not bad for something that doesn't clamp onto your skull with a vice grip! Pretty lightweight and comfortable so far, and the audio quality is pretty solid. Not astounding, but not poor by any means. Good for both voice chat and gaming, and not bad for music. For what its worth I'm probably not the best judge of that as I'm lacking a bit in sensitivity to lower tones/voices in one ear, so my hearing is always just a smidge off no matter what I listen through. Your mileage may vary.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I love these headphones. They were easy to setup with my PC. I LOVE that they are wireless. I hate having cords all over my gaming setup so being able to charge the headphones and rock them for about a week without needing to charge them is great. My previously Logitech headphones weren\\u2019t wireless and the cord would always get trapped under my chair. Now I don\\u2019t have to worry about it. The headphones also feel great. I wear glasses and sometimes headsets don\\u2019t fit comfortably with my glasses and the glasses arms would press against the back of my ears and hurt them, but I\\u2019ve worn these headphones for 8 hours straight and haven\\u2019t had any issues. They\\u2019re also really good and canceling our noise. My boyfriend and I play video games in the same room and when I wear my headphones it\\u2019s difficult to hear him talking in the room when he is several feet away from me. The headphones do a good job So far they\\u2019re definitely worth the price. Plus they look so cute with the lights on the sides.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"It's honestly unbelievable to me that I'm having such a hard time finding a headset with sound as good as my cheap 6-year-old $15 Sades headset that recently needed replacing, let alone better. It was uncomfortable, so I wouldn't buy another from that brand, but the sound was, I am realizing in retrospect as I try out more expensive headsets, unexpectedly great.\\n\\nAnyway, let's talk about this headset. I kind of love it. I wish I loved it more. It's good; it's just not perfect.\\n\\nCOMFORT: I'm a woman with a fairly average-sized head (hat size 7 1/8), and it's hard to find headsets that weren't only designed with large men's heads in mind. The elastic strap across the top of these makes the headset lighter and more comfortable to wear, and I really like it. The strap has two notches on each side, so you can adjust a bit for the size of your head. The strap being separate from the solid headband also helps you remove, adjust, or hang up the headset without directly touching your head or the strap, which is nice. The earcups are plush and cloth-covered, which is comfortable and doesn't get as hot as pleather cups normally do, and doesn't squeeze your head as much as those do while wearing glasses.\\n\\nHowever, the headset is still somewhat bulky, especially the large earcups, and while these are quite comfortable overall, it would have been even better for me if they were a little smaller and lighter. If you have a larger head, this will likely not be an issue for you.\\n\\nLOOKS/BUILD: These look nice (I got the white version), less boring and bulky than most gaming headsets on the market. The design is sleek and stylish, and the headset seems sturdy and well-made.\\n\\nHEADPHONE SOUND: It's ok. It's nothing amazing, and I would want to use something better for listening to music for fun, but it's not bad. The directional audio works ok for games.\\n\\nSOFTWARE: The Logitech G software is pretty good. It shows the battery percentage of the headset and allows you to adjust the lighting and various sound settings. But more on that when I get to the mic.\\n\\nLIGHTS: The RGB strips are a nice feature and they look good, but it seemed like I was hearing a slight buzz in the right ear when the lights were on, so I keep them turned off. Interestingly, if you go out of wireless range, the lights will go back on, so it works as an indicator for me.\\n\\nWIRELESS: The quality of the wireless is the biggest reason I love this headset. It works well and has a large, reliable range: I can walk most of the way across my apartment before it cuts out, which is important because I often have to chase after a naughty cat while in the middle of something, and I can keep up a conversation while I do.\\n\\n\\\"DISCORD INTEGRATION\\\": I still don't know what this is supposed to mean, but Discord does recognize the headset well, and I've never had it randomly disconnect inputs or have any other problems like I've had with other headsets. This headset has been very solid for me in that sense: you plug in the dongle and it just works.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: The battery life is very good. You can also still use the headset while it's charging, and it charges fast. The cable is just a normal USB-C to USB-A cable, so you can plug it in anywhere convenient. I'm regularly in calls all day without needing to charge the headset, so I normally plug it in overnight every day or two.\\n\\nMIC: Here's the problem, and the reason I'm rating this four stars. The mic isn't good. It's just not. It's functional, and if you're using this is in some way in which you'll never have to hear your own voice-- gaming, video calls-- it's good enough. But it's not good enough for streaming or recording. The Logitech software allows you to adjust all sorts of settings and even download settings other people put together, and it helps, but it doesn't make the mic good. I was hoping this could be all I'd need for now as my current setup is too noisy for a standalone mic, but I might have to look into getting a ModMic to stream with this. The mic itself doesn't flip up, but it's bendable and detachable, so you can remove it if you want to use a different mic.\\n\\nOVERALL: I wish the mic were better, and it would be great if the headphone sound were a bit more impressive too, but for the price, it's a very good headset overall for general use. If you need more professional sound, this is not that. There are no serious problems that I've encountered with the headset, though-- it's solid and reliable; it's just that the worst aspects of it are only ok and not great.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Let me start with the negative:\\n\\nThe only adjustment to the headband is to switch how it is attached to the headphones. Headband is elastic, so will likely stretch over time. Also, Logitech does not sell the earpads. Just the headstraps. I bought the white version, so I could swap out the straps and earpads to change colors. Wish Logitech made other colors for the other earpads and sold the earpads, because it would be cool to personalize them even more. Would sure love some teal earpads. Also, on the PS4, I have to adjust the mic every time I plug in the device. On the computer, the mic was set so low by default, it was difficult to hear the voice. Had to go into the Windows settings to adjust, using the old control panel option. PITA. Once turned up, it sounds fantastic. Finally, we cannot figure out how to turn off the lights when on the PS4. Using the app on Windows will let you do so when you are using the headset.\\n\\nSo why am I giving the headphones 5 stars with those negatives?\\n\\nThe incoming audio is fantastic. We are audiophiles here. Very good sound quality in the Logitech G733 headsets. My husband, a musician, loves the sound quality. He is very picky. Even bought his own pair of G733s, after trying mine. He is using it for work too.\\n\\nThe mic is also outstanding. Crisp, clear audio from both my female alto voice and his baritone gruff voice. He has used mine on MS Team meetings (windows 10) for work, and when we play cooperatively on PS4 video games, on PS Plus, using different PS4s.\\n\\nEven though the headset was a tad tight at first, and there are limited settings, both of us love the comfort. I prefer the other earpads to the Logitech ones. They are softer. But the Logitech ones feel like memory foam. Will likely last longer than the cheap purple ones I bought.\\n\\nI also bought the wireless Hyper X Cloud II headset, before buying these. The G733s were second on my list. The sound quality of the Cloud II is equal to the Logitech G733. The mic quality is not as clear in the Cloud II. The comfort in the Cloud II is just a smidgen better. It has more adjustments too.\\n\\nCannot rate them on PC gaming latency though. I do not play PC games. There is a little delay on the PS4 online gaming, however, one cannot necessarily blame the headset. Sony is not known to have the fastest servers.\\n\\nHope this helps you make an educated decision. I love these, from a style, fit, comfort and audio/mic quality perspective.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"For the price these are probably one of the most solid products I've ever purchased. I'm the kind of guy who never says/thinks that kind of thing (I'm very picky when it comes to spending money) or even writes reviews, so take that into consideration when reading this. I bought these in Oct. '21 and they've MORE than lasted since then. I have replaced the bungee head strap, but I'm a freakishly tall guy with a commensurately big head so I'm not surprised I stretched it out. That's probably the only piece that I'll need to replace regularly ($15 every 6 months, I can live with that). The cups just got a little gunky after a few months and were also replaced but after cleaning the originals I now have a set of two that can be swapped out any time. The rest of the build quality is excellent. I remove the mic \\\"stump\\\" multiple times every day (usually if I'm eating or something) and it's never given me any issues at all. This piece can also be swapped out, but are a bit more expensive than the other items. I guess you could probably just plug any old 3.5mm jacked mic into the headset and just use it that way, I can't imagine you'd lose any features but you may.\\n\\nThe sound quality is really not bad at all. Not amazing or outside of the expectation of a product like this, but it's quite good. I do find myself often using these instead of other options when walking around the house. They're a bit bulky, but I'm not putting them on for the sake of my image. The noise cancellation is meh to serviceable, I can still easily hear my dog barking out the front window downstairs when all the kids get out of school and are walking by to get home.\\n\\nThe range is decent, I'd say it's about a 50 foot bubble from the transmitter. It goes through drywall decently enough, but not so easily through brick or concrete unless it's very thin. You won't be listening to Never Gonna Give You Up on your way to the mailbox, but a kitchen run is definitely still on the table.\\n\\nThe software that comes with (Logitech G Hub) can be a little buggy, but your mileage may vary. My computer is an ancient relic from a bygone era, so if you're using hardware newer than 2015 you'll probably have a better time. It does allow lots of cool features and total control over the EQ for both sound and your voice, and I REALLY enjoy the built-in side tone feature, (which is when you can hear your own voice in exact real time through the headset as you speak, thus making it easier to speak naturally and not too loudly or even be purposefully quieter than you normally would) as the ear cups do muffle your own voice to a fair degree.\\n\\nThe sound quality of the mic is... not amazing, but it's still leagues better than anything that anyone I work with uses. Our company issues these little garbage headsets that make it sound like you're talking through a drive-thru speaker, so almost anything would have been an upgrade. Like I mentioned before, you can tweak the voice EQ in the settings but it's still limited. You're not going to get full blown desk mic performance out of this, but besides sounding a tad compressed it's still really not that bad. I have an awesome desk mic with an arm that I use for recording work stuff, and the headphones still work wonderfully without using the included mic attachment.\\n\\nThis gets it's own section: The noise cancellation on the mic. It's actually pretty sweet. I have to run a window A/C unit in the summer and a space heater in the winter in the room in which I work. They're not very quiet at all, but with this mic you'd almost never know they were on. You do get a bit of that \\\"fade in, fade out\\\" with the background noise when you speak, but this thing isn't some $1000 solution for those kinds of problems, so take it or leave it. It's really not that bad, you probably wouldn't even notice if I hadn't told you.\\n\\nAll-in-all, these are an extraordinary value for what they are. I don't really review stuff, and I'm supposed to be doing something else right now, but I just had the random urge to write this review so here I am. Buy these - you won't regret it.\",\n",

My girlfriend bought me these headphones a while back, and i love them.\\n\\nThe comfort of wearing them is 11/10. These headphones are incredibly comfortable, i can (and sometimes do) wear these nonstop. Sometimes i forget i even have them on. They dont block much sound out, so if your looking for noise cancel/isolation this isnt really the headset for you. i would guess that 60% of the ambient noise can leak into the headset.\\n\\nThe mic is not great, if you are looking for a high quality microphone this isnt it. Its good enough to communicate through voice, people wont have a hard time understanding you, but this is not some high grade microphone. Its pretty standard, a benefit is the microphone piece itself can be removed and maybe even replaced since its just a standard headphone jack that the mic plugs into. So the microphone itself can be removed. Most of the time i have the mic in and it seems very durable. Even if you do break it buying a replacement mic bit is pretty cheap on amazon.\\n\\nThe main reason i give this set 5/5 stars despite the mic not being great is because they are the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn in my life. These are wearable, they are truly comfortable. I cannot stress how comfortable these headphones are, it is 11/10 in that department which carries an otherwise 4/5 star headset into being 5 stars.\",\n",

The easiest way to adjust the sound using Advanced EQ is to run your game and G HUB, pick a preset filter (for instance; FPS) and adjust the EQ while playing, experiment with the sliders (and other filters) go as deep or high as you want, when your finished you can save the filter to any name you want, don\\u2019t worry about the original you can reset that to default. This headset focuses on spatial sound (with Surround Sound enabled) and does a great job, among the best I heard while gaming.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: Excellent 29 hours with RGB off and 20 hours with RGB on.\\n\\nMIC: I\\u2019ve used a few different headsets through the years and this one has the best mic. It\\u2019s not the quality of a high-end broadcaster's mic but it\\u2019s everything you need for gaming, and it does sound pretty darn good with Blue Voice filtering (G HUB) enabled.

            "        \"9\": \"I got these for gaming, listening to music, and chatting with friends on Discord. Once I had them fully charged and set up, I tested the mic first which sounded great after just some minimal setting tweaking. Next, I started listening to some music while looking at the sound settings and before even tweaking anything yet, they started having a sudden robotic static vibration-like sound. I tried a quite a few things to fix this, but the only thing that actually worked was turning the headset completely off and then back on again. But the static robot sounds kept coming back no matter what I did around the 5-10 minute mark of use each and every time. My volume was only at 50% and I was using default settings for sound, so it couldn't have been anything I did, and tweaking the settings in an attempt to fix the issue just made it sound even worse. I'm assuming this is a manufacturing issue of some sort with this particular pair. Other than that issue, when they did work they were amazing, probably even one of the best sounding pairs I've ever had for under $200... if only they weren't messed up. I'm returning them and going back to a brand I'm more familiar with though, for now.\",\n",

Due to the gripe, I keep the RGB off so the sound doesn't bother me while I game and watch videos.

The battery life and wireless range is phenomenal, both are so much better than my previous Corsairs! I was charging those daily, after only about 4-5 hours I'd get low battery warnings, but I almost never have to charge these, it's insane how long they last... and the range is almost twice what I got from the Corsairs, I can roam all over and never lose sound! So just be sure to tweak the sound a bit as I noted before, and maybe about $15 of the price is simply for the brand name, but I'm liking these more and more with time!\\n\\nInitial Review:\\n\\nOk, I'm really torn on these... First things first: myself, along with many others, think the sound quality is horrible out of the box! People that say they sound great I don't think have experience with more expensive headphones and are probably moving up from $30 cheapos...\\n\\nFirst thing: After scouring Reddit and some trial and error, turn off all the special sound settings (like DTS and advanced settings) and move the bass to +7 and the treble to +4. After I made this change, the quality was much much better!\\n\\nI previously had Corsair HS70s for two years and HS80s for two years, but I hate the iCue software Corsair uses, it's a ridiculous resource hog and constantly has issues.

The headphones do a good job So far they\\u2019re definitely worth the price. Plus they look so cute with the lights on the sides.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"It's honestly unbelievable to me that I'm having such a hard time finding a headset with sound as good as my cheap 6-year-old $15 Sades headset that recently needed replacing, let alone better. It was uncomfortable, so I wouldn't buy another from that brand, but the sound was, I am realizing in retrospect as I try out more expensive headsets, unexpectedly great.\\n\\nAnyway, let's talk about this headset. I kind of love it. I wish I loved it more. It's good; it's just not perfect.\\n\\nCOMFORT: I'm a woman with a fairly average-sized head (hat size 7 1/8), and it's hard to find headsets that weren't only designed with large men's heads in mind. The elastic strap across the top of these makes the headset lighter and more comfortable to wear, and I really like it. The strap has two notches on each side, so you can adjust a bit for the size of your head. The strap being separate from the solid headband also helps you remove, adjust, or hang up the headset without directly touching your head or the strap, which is nice. The earcups are plush and cloth-covered, which is comfortable and doesn't get as hot as pleather cups normally do, and doesn't squeeze your head as much as those do while wearing glasses.\\n\\nHowever, the headset is still somewhat bulky, especially the large earcups, and while these are quite comfortable overall, it would have been even better for me if they were a little smaller and lighter. If you have a larger head, this will likely not be an issue for you.\\n\\nLOOKS/BUILD: These look nice (I got the white version), less boring and bulky than most gaming headsets on the market. The design is sleek and stylish, and the headset seems sturdy and well-made.\\n\\nHEADPHONE SOUND: It's ok. It's nothing amazing, and I would want to use something better for listening to music for fun, but it's not bad. The directional audio works ok for games.\\n\\nSOFTWARE: The Logitech G software is pretty good. It shows the battery percentage of the headset and allows you to adjust the lighting and various sound settings. But more on that when I get to the mic.\\n\\nLIGHTS: The RGB strips are a nice feature and they look good, but it seemed like I was hearing a slight buzz in the right ear when the lights were on, so I keep them turned off. Interestingly, if you go out of wireless range, the lights will go back on, so it works as an indicator for me.\\n\\nWIRELESS: The quality of the wireless is the biggest reason I love this headset. It works well and has a large, reliable range: I can walk most of the way across my apartment before it cuts out, which is important because I often have to chase after a naughty cat while in the middle of something, and I can keep up a conversation while I do.\\n\\n\\\"DISCORD INTEGRATION\\\": I still don't know what this is supposed to mean, but Discord does recognize the headset well, and I've never had it randomly disconnect inputs or have any other problems like I've had with other headsets. This headset has been very solid for me in that sense: you plug in the dongle and it just works.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: The battery life is very good. You can also still use the headset while it's charging, and it charges fast. The cable is just a normal USB-C to USB-A cable, so you can plug it in anywhere convenient. I'm regularly in calls all day without needing to charge the headset, so I normally plug it in overnight every day or two.\\n\\nMIC: Here's the problem, and the reason I'm rating this four stars. The mic isn't good. It's just not. It's functional, and if you're using this is in some way in which you'll never have to hear your own voice-- gaming, video calls-- it's good enough. But it's not good enough for streaming or recording. The Logitech software allows you to adjust all sorts of settings and even download settings other people put together, and it helps, but it doesn't make the mic good. I was hoping this could be all I'd need for now as my current setup is too noisy for a standalone mic, but I might have to look into getting a ModMic to stream with this. The mic itself doesn't flip up, but it's bendable and detachable, so you can remove it if you want to use a different mic.\\n\\nOVERALL: I wish the mic were better, and it would be great if the headphone sound were a bit more impressive too, but for the price, it's a very good headset overall for general use. If you need more professional sound, this is not that. There are no serious problems that I've encountered with the headset, though-- it's solid and reliable; it's just that the worst aspects of it are only ok and not great.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Let me start with the negative:\\n\\nThe only adjustment to the headband is to switch how it is attached to the headphones. Headband is elastic, so will likely stretch over time. Also, Logitech does not sell the earpads. Just the headstraps. I bought the white version, so I could swap out the straps and earpads to change colors. Wish Logitech made other colors for the other earpads and sold the earpads, because it would be cool to personalize them even more. Would sure love some teal earpads. Also, on the PS4, I have to adjust the mic every time I plug in the device. On the computer, the mic was set so low by default, it was difficult to hear the voice. Had to go into the Windows settings to adjust, using the old control panel option. PITA. Once turned up, it sounds fantastic. Finally, we cannot figure out how to turn off the lights when on the PS4. Using the app on Windows will let you do so when you are using the headset.\\n\\nSo why am I giving the headphones 5 stars with those negatives?\\n\\nThe incoming audio is fantastic. We are audiophiles here. Very good sound quality in the Logitech G733 headsets. My husband, a musician, loves the sound quality. He is very picky. Even bought his own pair of G733s, after trying mine. He is using it for work too.\\n\\nThe mic is also outstanding. Crisp, clear audio from both my female alto voice and his baritone gruff voice. He has used mine on MS Team meetings (windows 10) for work, and when we play cooperatively on PS4 video games, on PS Plus, using different PS4s.\\n\\nEven though the headset was a tad tight at first, and there are limited settings, both of us love the comfort. I prefer the other earpads to the Logitech ones. They are softer. But the Logitech ones feel like memory foam. Will likely last longer than the cheap purple ones I bought.\\n\\nI also bought the wireless Hyper X Cloud II headset, before buying these. The G733s were second on my list. The sound quality of the Cloud II is equal to the Logitech G733. The mic quality is not as clear in the Cloud II. The comfort in the Cloud II is just a smidgen better. It has more adjustments too.\\n\\nCannot rate them on PC gaming latency though. I do not play PC games. There is a little delay on the PS4 online gaming, however, one cannot necessarily blame the headset. Sony is not known to have the fastest servers.\\n\\nHope this helps you make an educated decision. I love these, from a style, fit, comfort and audio/mic quality perspective.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"For the price these are probably one of the most solid products I've ever purchased. I'm the kind of guy who never says/thinks that kind of thing (I'm very picky when it comes to spending money) or even writes reviews, so take that into consideration when reading this. I bought these in Oct. '21 and they've MORE than lasted since then. I have replaced the bungee head strap, but I'm a freakishly tall guy with a commensurately big head so I'm not surprised I stretched it out. That's probably the only piece that I'll need to replace regularly ($15 every 6 months, I can live with that). The cups just got a little gunky after a few months and were also replaced but after cleaning the originals I now have a set of two that can be swapped out any time. The rest of the build quality is excellent. I remove the mic \\\"stump\\\" multiple times every day (usually if I'm eating or something) and it's never given me any issues at all. This piece can also be swapped out, but are a bit more expensive than the other items. I guess you could probably just plug any old 3.5mm jacked mic into the headset and just use it that way, I can't imagine you'd lose any features but you may.\\n\\nThe sound quality is really not bad at all. Not amazing or outside of the expectation of a product like this, but it's quite good. I do find myself often using these instead of other options when walking around the house. They're a bit bulky, but I'm not putting them on for the sake of my image. The noise cancellation is meh to serviceable, I can still easily hear my dog barking out the front window downstairs when all the kids get out of school and are walking by to get home.\\n\\nThe range is decent, I'd say it's about a 50 foot bubble from the transmitter. It goes through drywall decently enough, but not so easily through brick or concrete unless it's very thin. You won't be listening to Never Gonna Give You Up on your way to the mailbox, but a kitchen run is definitely still on the table.\\n\\nThe software that comes with (Logitech G Hub) can be a little buggy, but your mileage may vary. My computer is an ancient relic from a bygone era, so if you're using hardware newer than 2015 you'll probably have a better time. It does allow lots of cool features and total control over the EQ for both sound and your voice, and I REALLY enjoy the built-in side tone feature, (which is when you can hear your own voice in exact real time through the headset as you speak, thus making it easier to speak naturally and not too loudly or even be purposefully quieter than you normally would) as the ear cups do muffle your own voice to a fair degree.\\n\\nThe sound quality of the mic is... not amazing, but it's still leagues better than anything that anyone I work with uses. Our company issues these little garbage headsets that make it sound like you're talking through a drive-thru speaker, so almost anything would have been an upgrade. Like I mentioned before, you can tweak the voice EQ in the settings but it's still limited. You're not going to get full blown desk mic performance out of this, but besides sounding a tad compressed it's still really not that bad. I have an awesome desk mic with an arm that I use for recording work stuff, and the headphones still work wonderfully without using the included mic attachment.\\n\\nThis gets it's own section: The noise cancellation on the mic. It's actually pretty sweet. I have to run a window A/C unit in the summer and a space heater in the winter in the room in which I work. They're not very quiet at all, but with this mic you'd almost never know they were on. You do get a bit of that \\\"fade in, fade out\\\" with the background noise when you speak, but this thing isn't some $1000 solution for those kinds of problems, so take it or leave it. It's really not that bad, you probably wouldn't even notice if I hadn't told you.\\n\\nAll-in-all, these are an extraordinary value for what they are. I don't really review stuff, and I'm supposed to be doing something else right now, but I just had the random urge to write this review so here I am. Buy these - you won't regret it.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Logitech has a reputation for making products that will last way longer than you need it to. This is no exception. My girlfriend bought me these headphones a while back, and i love them.\\n\\nThe comfort of wearing them is 11/10. These headphones are incredibly comfortable, i can (and sometimes do) wear these nonstop. Sometimes i forget i even have them on. They dont block much sound out, so if your looking for noise cancel/isolation this isnt really the headset for you. i would guess that 60% of the ambient noise can leak into the headset.\\n\\nThe mic is not great, if you are looking for a high quality microphone this isnt it. Its good enough to communicate through voice, people wont have a hard time understanding you, but this is not some high grade microphone. Its pretty standard, a benefit is the microphone piece itself can be removed and maybe even replaced since its just a standard headphone jack that the mic plugs into. So the microphone itself can be removed. Most of the time i have the mic in and it seems very durable. Even if you do break it buying a replacement mic bit is pretty cheap on amazon.\\n\\nThe main reason i give this set 5/5 stars despite the mic not being great is because they are the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn in my life. These are wearable, they are truly comfortable. I cannot stress how comfortable these headphones are, it is 11/10 in that department which carries an otherwise 4/5 star headset into being 5 stars.\",\n",

This headset was specifically designed for gaming, it also works well with streaming, and is designed to be used with Logitech G HUB software. The G HUB software is needed to take full advantage of all the features.\\n\\nPRO\\u2019s:\\n\\nCOMFORT: This headset is super comfortable and ultra-light (9.8 oz) and is perfect for marathon sessions.\\n\\nSOUND: The sound is excellent, use G HUB to enable Advanced EQ and Surround Sound. The easiest way to adjust the sound using Advanced EQ is to run your game and G HUB, pick a preset filter (for instance; FPS) and adjust the EQ while playing, experiment with the sliders (and other filters) go as deep or high as you want, when your finished you can save the filter to any name you want, don\\u2019t worry about the original you can reset that to default.

            "        \"9\": \"I got these for gaming, listening to music, and chatting with friends on Discord. Once I had them fully charged and set up, I tested the mic first which sounded great after just some minimal setting tweaking. Next, I started listening to some music while looking at the sound settings and before even tweaking anything yet, they started having a sudden robotic static vibration-like sound. I tried a quite a few things to fix this, but the only thing that actually worked was turning the headset completely off and then back on again. But the static robot sounds kept coming back no matter what I did around the 5-10 minute mark of use each and every time. My volume was only at 50% and I was using default settings for sound, so it couldn't have been anything I did, and tweaking the settings in an attempt to fix the issue just made it sound even worse. I'm assuming this is a manufacturing issue of some sort with this particular pair. Other than that issue, when they did work they were amazing, probably even one of the best sounding pairs I've ever had for under $200... if only they weren't messed up. I'm returning them and going back to a brand I'm more familiar with though, for now.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"This headset does everything and more. It sounds great, super lightweight (hardly feel it on my head), mic quality is decent, and battery life is fairly solid. Only gripe with this headset is when it is in RGB mode there's a little buzzish sound that comes from the earcups (I know it sounds crazy but there's a buzz sound only when RGB is active). Due to the gripe, I keep the RGB off so the sound doesn't bother me while I game and watch videos. For the price point, it's solid and would recommend to others that want to swap from wired to wireless like me.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Picked up the BlackShark V2 Pros recently, so far so good based on first impressions. These are definitely a step up as far as comfort, sound quality, and mic quality are concerned when compared to other Razer headsets. Note that the following review was typed out with the PC platform in mind, this headset will function wirelessly and via 3.5mm cable without THX audio support on PS4/PS5 but still takes advantage of 7.1 surround sound. As far as I can tell, these will not function via the wireless dongle on Xbox consoles but can still be used wired.\\n\\nComfort: Easily the most comfortable headset I've ever worn, the earcups are breathable and the headset itself feels very lightweight with no noticeable amount of pressure on my head. Haven't noticed any sliding issues with the thin metal bars that allow for fit adjustment, they seem surprisingly sturdy given how precariously delicate they appear to be. For a Razer product, it's surprising to see no obvious problems with build quality.\\n\\nSound Quality: Needs a bit of adjustment of the box via the Razer Synapse app. It took about five minutes to calibrate THX audio settings to my liking, but beyond that, everything sounds great! No complaints with bass, mids, and lows while listening to music or on Twitch/Youtube, the headset itself gets very loud on max volume with very little perceptible distortion. No in-game complaints so far either, the 7.1 surround sound seems to be properly calibrated for picking up low sounds such as footsteps and other audio prompts. To me, they sound almost as good as my Astro A50 Gen 4 headset for nearly half the price.\\n\\nMic: Very good for a wireless headset microphone after adjusting ambient noise and voice clarity settings,, haven't had any complaints from friends and randoms on Discord. I do have a couple of issues with it though:\\n\\n- Mic sidetone is very quiet even at full volume. Not a deal breaker for me personally, but it could be for those who prefer a more audible sidetone.\\n- Placement within the headset can be a bit cumbersome upon insertion; can be finicky and will not function unless placed and spun counterclockwise. Takes a bit of trial and error but will stay in place once properly fitted.\\n\\nNoise cancellation: Passive only, will not filter out loud noises at same level as most closed back headphones. This seems to be the trade off for having such a comfortable fit. However, neither myself nor my partner have noticed any audio bleed or speaker audio being picked up by the mic.\\n\\nMiscellaneous: note that the earcups are not removable or replaceable, which is a strange omission given that the Blackshark V2 wired variant has that option. Go with those instead if you don't mind the wires and are looking to customize or properly maintain the earcups. The Pro variant also charges via an included Micro USB, which may be a turnoff for those who have already fully converted over to USB Type C.\\n\\nOverall verdict: definitely worth the $160 spent, I can't recommend the BlackShark V2 Pro enough. When it comes to Razer's audio options, this is definitely the way to go as far as their wireless headsets are concerned. This review will be updated if any issues arise over time.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"First I want to preface by saying I just tested this for an hour at time of writing, but I will update after 30 days. This is my first Razor headset ever as I steered clear because of build quality, but this headset won me over...\\n\\nPros:\\n-Best sound I have had on a wireless (gaming) headset and I have plenty, this is right under the steelseries arctis pro wireless which I did have for a test.\\n-Good build quality and the metal hinges are super tight, some have had loose fitting ones, mine did not have those.\\n-comfort, this is comparable to my arctis 7 2019 with brainwavz. I am going to mod some brainwavz on these too. The earpads are fine for most people stock though.\\n-mic quality is very good, maybe the best I have heard on a wireless set, but this also leads to a small con as well which I will cover below.\\n-razor synapse is good, I jumped in and set a v eq and then tested the gaming preset which was good also. Very good customizing here, gotta have an adjustable eq for me before I'm buying it.\\n-battery life, TBD but it is very loud and advertises 20+ hours. No problems with it being quiet on pc and Ps5.\\n-clarity is superb and thx is very good for my purposes.\\nCons\\n-it did not clip sound (distort) until I pre-amped it, but it really isn't needed. It did clip sound on ps5 if I maxed the USB up, but leave it at 90% and you should be good.\\n-mic is a huge one, it's a cardioid style mic and it is pretty big, but it does have very good quality once dialed in with Synapse.\\n-no THX on ps5, but 3d sound works just fine. On PC this is very high end sound imo as this can hit some really good kHz 28k and is near Hifi.\\n-no USB C and is only micro USB, just a small gripe, not deducting from what this headset does.\\n-will work on Xbox only if wired, but the 3.5mm cable Razor supplied is a nice braided L cable.\\n-volume knob is huge, but that's aesthitics which is fine for most.\\n\\nOverall: If you have the money to spend a little more than 100 I would get this if your primary use is Pc/Ps5. This headset stomps the pulse 3d wireless and is better than my Arctis 7 2019 for my purposes of use. This will work wired as well, but I have not tested on Xbox. I will update after 30 days of use. Razor has made an exceptional headset here and this is going to be between Arctis 7 and this being my daily driver. Btw, I have large ears and this is still over the ear for me and is super comfy.\\n\\nUpdate Feb 4th: battery life, sound and comfort is still great. It sounds great wired on my series X using DTS sound unbound. The drivers have broke in a little bit and battery life is around 24 to 25 hours at about 65% volume. These get as loud as my gen3 A50's. Build quality should be fine as I don't see any failure points for my use and I baby these and keep them on a headset holder. These are still 5 star for me.\\nUpdate 03/09/2021:\\nThe Blackshark V2 Pro is still working fine and I have used this on my Series X (wired), PS5 (wired and wireless), and pc (wired and wireless). Battery life has been around 23 to 24 hours as the volume is kept around 70%. Mic has been fine when used on all platforms and the comfort after these have broken in is second only to my Arctis 7, which both are close in comfort. Nothing faulty and build has held up very well. I will say that it is a pain to change earpads, but other than that it's still a very good headset.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Razer BlackShark V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset: THX 7.1 ~150 USD\\n\\nThese earphones have beautiful sound and are very comfortable! There were no weird ear pains after extended use (for you hardcore gamers or audiophiles). I spent the first night owning them just listening to my stereo receiver (Marantz system). Playing high quality, lossless audio files, was great. MP3 will not make these headsets shine due to their crappy quality. Elder Scrolls Online was amazing with this set. I could hear all sorts of ambient and directional sound I never noticed before and felt much more immersed. That is saying a lot because I have very nice computer and stereo already connected together it plays though.\\n\\nThe Headset Setup - was both really easy and unclear at the same time. Once it was working and I understood its function it was been fine. I read the instructions and could not get the audio through to the set. Directly wiring them proved they could work and produce sound. Windows sound settings in my computer has 8 possible options listed. 'Speakers (Razer BlackShark V2 Pro)' was my 'wireless' setting. 'Speakers THX spatial' has never worked, I assume it is because I have not yet played THX film or THX certified audio yet. Wired, I saw it was 'Speakers (High Definition Audio Device)'. I have a lot of audio devices attached it seems weird they cant get 'wired' or 'wireless' or 'BlackShark' in to the listed options for clarity.\\n\\nCharging port - I think it is an old school usb mini port on the headset, for the price I expected something better. USB-C would have been nice, or a headset stand that charges. The port does not connect smoothly and can be inserted crooked easily. Fully inserted, it looks and feels halfway in, probably it is just poor manufacturing that it does not snug up to the plastic body well.\\n\\nIn my experience this is the headsets flaw, this charging port will be the failing point. Some dirt or dust or food piece gets in there or the tiny connector wires get worn or bent and it is all over for wireless. I have ruined handfuls of these ports in my past devices. I know the batteries will wear out in 3-5 years but I have sets that have lasted 15 years.\\n\\nI hope this helps someone out!\",\n",

Sometimes amazon combines similar item reviews, this is important and that I have owned this for over a year with consistent usage, using it multiple days a week for 1-8 hours.\\n\\nThis thing has a lot going for it with very few downsides that in my opinion do not outweigh the pros and if you can get this for $150 or less it is 100% worth it.\\n\\nPros\\n\\n- Noise cancellation is so strong, sometimes I don't hear my wife when she calls for me. She was the one who bought this for me lol\\n- Sound quality through synapse can be adjusted to your liking, and I can't recommend it without it (kind of a con)\\n- Incredibly comfortable even with glasses. There is a lot of good padding on the head and ears, prior headsets this was always an issue, recently before this I owned a corsair void elite and even that wasn't perfect, but it was close in this category.\\n- Battery life is actually really strong, just be sure to charge it after each usage. I've only ever gotten this to low battery where it beeps at me if I use it for 10-12 hours without charging it. Sometimes thats a long gaming day sometimes thats multiple days. I'm pretty good about keeping things charged, so this isn't a pain point for me, but may be for you. That said you can charge while using it.\\n- Removable microphone, probably not a huge deal for most, but I use these as headphones not a headset. I use an external USB mic for better quality (I'll get into that later).\\n- Ability to use this with 3.5mm port. I wouldn't recommend this without the USB function, as the USB DAC it comes with is decent enough and having used it without it, this is where it fails, but I'm labeling the 3.5mm port as a pro in case you have a multipurpose headset in mind\\n- THX 7.1, now this is just virtual surround sound but in the couple games I have tried, notably monster hunter world, it performs really well, its weird to get used to but its done well enough. Not a huge selling point, you can get this elsewhere, but noted.\\n\\nCons\\n\\n- Without the USB DAC and synapse you are losing a lot of potential. This thing is really good for sound quality once you configure it, but on it's own it's horrible, this is why I did not get the wired version of the blackshark v2 with just 3.5mm.\\n- Microphone quality isn't great, its honestly worse than most and for $180 it should be a lot better, this is why I use an external mic. Unless you're yelling, your friends will probably say you're quiet.\\n- Intermittent disconnects, unsure if this is a hardware, connection or synapse issue but it happens infrequently it doesn't bother me, but should be noted.\\n- Synapse, I swear I've had issues with every gaming software (ghub, icue, synapse) but recently synapse has been a pain. I love iCUE (or did) but hate corsair software, but if synapse continues to get worse I will look elsewhere for another headset.\\n\\nOverall, if I had to buy this thing again I'd do it for $130 or so. I wouldn't spend $180, I'd just get professional wired headphones, but this thing has a lot going on that it made it worth it to me. I recommend these headphones to anyone who is in the market for a wireless headset in this budget range who doesn't hold grudges against razer. In that niche, I think its perfect.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I bought these headphones as a wireless solution for gaming and listening to music in my room, as the corsair headset I had been using was both limiting in how far away from my PC I could get, as well as the fact that I kept tripping on the cord or getting it caught on my office chair as I'd roll it around.\\n\\nSet up:\\nSet up for these headphones was easy and quick. I followed the included instructions, restarted my rig, and it was done. My only complaint here is that the included Razor software did cause some issues for some reason when it was running alongside Discord, so I've opted to not run it. Neither the headphones nor my Razor mouse have RGB, so it's not really a loss.\\n\\nSound:\\nAfter using these for a week, and running some tests on them the sound seems good. The range they can reproduce seems to be 30 to just a few points under15,000 Hz. There is some rumble or buzzing when the bass frequencies are quickly modulated, and it can at times get a little muddy. This is especially evident if you adjust the volume at the same time, but this really was only noticeable while I was actively testing the sound, and doesn't come up often when gaming or listening to music where there are many different tones at once. I suspect that only the utmost audiophiles would really mind. (Which I'm not.)\\n\\nVoice:\\nVoice is hard to judge when using VOIP because so much also depends on what the other party is sending out, your latency with the Discord or other server, and lastly your own audio equipment. As such the most I can say is that the headset was no disappointing and performed at least as well as any other sub-$200 headset I've used. I don't expect you're going to have the binaural experience of your life, but I have no complaints.\\n\\nMicrophone:\\nSpeaking with those in my gaming group, they report that the quality of the voice I was sending with my mic was clear and crisp, and that there was no appreciable background noise. All in all, I'd rate it better than the Corsair HS60 I had been using.\\n\\nNoise cancelation:\\nUsing these, I was unable to hear my wife.\\n\\nComfort:\\nI've had issues before with other headsets feeling tight, or putting pressure on the arms of my glasses, which can over time be painful. Thankfully, the ear cups on these headphones are much lighter is the pressure they apply, and as a result I get no pinching or discomfort. Everything is very soft, and the experience is pleasant.\\n\\nFit and Finish:\\nThe headset looks really well put together, and although I've already left some fingerprints on the satin black finish, it is relatively simple to clean.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"Another Update: If you are noticing that these headphones sound lousy on your PC, muddy mid tones and non crisp audio, simply uninstall Razer Synapse and they will sound SO much better. I spent hours fiddling around with the EQ settings and I could never get them right even though they sound fantastic on my PS5. By uninstalling Synapse and just running these direct from the USB dongle, they sound so much more clear and crisp.\\nAlso, if you're using windows, download Dolby atmos and just keep it on the default settings. I found that gives the most crisp, full, 3d audio that sounds fantastic\\n\\nYou can use Dolby Atmos through windows if you want to tweek the sound and get 3D audio and it even has an EQ so you have the best of both worlds. This should dramatically improve the audio quality\\n\\nUpdate: had these things for a few months and I still love them! They work great on my PS5 as well as my PC although it can get a little difficulty finding the right EQ settings and changes to them will drastically improve or degrade the sound. All in all, five out of five product\\n----\\nThese things are amazing! I was looking for a good pair of wireless headphones that were compatible with the 3D sound on my PS5. With the included dongle, these things are basically just plug and play; both my PS5 and PC effortless and quickly recognize the headphones when they are turned on.\\n\\nI'm not an audiophile, but audio in music and games is important to me. These things really shine especially at this price point and the fact that they are wireless. When I first tested them on my PS5, I wasn't blown away with the 3D audio, until I switched by to my old but high quality sanheauser headphones. WOW what a difference in audio quality and spatial awareness.\\n\\nAs with any good headphones, you're not getting the most out of them if you're not properly equalizing them. The headphones come with decent presets (on the synapse PC app) but I've included a better equalization in the picture. Switch between the default preset and this and you will really hear how well these headphones can shine with proper equalization. Very clear tones with rich bass!\\n\\nThe headphones are high quality. They do have a light grip on your head and and they will move around on your head, but for a person who wears glasses this is a good thing since they dramatically increase the comfort level and reduce the change of your glasses causing pressure points. The material on the headphones is a little spongy to finger prints but not a big deal.\\n\\nThe only thing that makes me nervous is the USB dongle situation. I would really like to order an extra dongle since I hope to take these between my PC and my PS5, so I worry if i lose this I will be out of luck. I bought a third party usb dongle but I can't connect them, so I think you are stuck with the factory Razer dongle that doesn't seem easy to replace. Not a negative, just a small drawback. I would feel much better if I could either buy a replacement dongle on razers website (you can't at the moment) or have the ability to connect to a third party dongle\\n\\nFor 170, these seem like a screaming deal. It's so much nicer playing on my PC now with fewer wires and they sound as good if not better than my wired headphones. I'd highly recommend these\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"I have used these a few times so far and feel like my opinion of them probably won't change much over time, pending some drastic change with them. I don't want to lie and say I don't like them, I ALMOST love them! There are just a few things that hold them back from being excellent.\\n\\nThe sound with these is just okay. I wasn't expecting studio quality or anything, but I think the audio could be a little better. I don't know if it is because of the THX Spacial audio that I need to figure out how to disable or adjust, but sometimes they sound tinny. Call me old school, but just give me two channels: left and right.\\n\\nThe battery life seems fine. I haven't allowed them to die, but I have used them over several days for a few hours each without concerns for battery life. I know I can access a rough battery indicator through the Razer software, but it would be nice to tap the power button and hear \\\"X percent battery remaining\\\" or something like that. Even the jankiest and cheap wireless headphones I've tried have this feature, but that's more nit-picky.\\n\\nCompletely unnoticeable latency from my experience. I have tried so many wireless headsets that end up in the garbage because they're advertised as \\\"Gaming Headsets,\\\" but when you have 500ms latency, you might as well mute the game. The fact that I can *mostly* use them wirelessly and not get caught up in my headset cord is magical. I catch myself trying to move the phantom cable out of my way because I am so used to it. It's like when I wear contacts and keep trying to push my glasses up, but it's a good feeling.\\n\\nI say that I can *mostly* use them wirelessly because these have a horrid range. I am sitting 3 feet from my PC using these, and I keep getting the disconnect/reconnect tone from turning to look out the window or even tilting my head to the side. From what I've seen, these are supposed to work up to 10 meters. The advertised 10 meters must be in a vacuum because, in my real-life scenario, I'm getting roughly 1 meter. I think Razer may have forgotten the decimal in \\\"1.0 meter\\\". Even reaching up with my hand to turn the volume up or down blocks the signal and disconnects. This \\\"feature\\\" is excellent for when my wife talks to me, though, because I can just put my hand up and \\\"mute\\\" them!\\n\\nThey are very comfortable. Some headphones I've used that are \\\"over the ear\\\" tend to be too small for actual over-the-ear coverage, or the headbands adjust in awkward ways that don't allow you to have a comfortable experience. The build quality is very excellent. They don't feel cheap and are put together well. I also love the removable microphone. So many gaming headsets have them built in and can't be removed.\\n\\nPros:\\n* Decent sound for gaming.\\n* Good battery life.\\n* Unnoticeable latency.\\n* Very comfortable and adjustable.\\n* Removable microphone.\\n* Nice build quality.\\n* Volume knob built into headphones.\\n\\nCons:\\n* THX Spacial audio seems lackluster.\\n* Wireless range is terrible.\\n\\nUltimately, they would be fantastic, but they are literally being held back by the awful wireless range. I am fine with the fact that I can't go check the mail and still be connected, but when I'm sitting directly in front of my PC and have disconnects, that's enough to make them not worth the cost. Fortunately, they support a 3.5mm cable so if you need more range than 3 feet you should be fine. Honestly, if I had a better wireless option I would probably send these back today.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I use headsets mostly for discord, playing survival games, and listening to music\\u2014and although I would not classify myself as an audiophile, I can appreciate some degree of layering, and I certainly enjoy my bass. What I want in a wireless headset is comfort, lasting build quality, clear mic, good sound, and good range (tall order, I know, but I can dream). I am aware that wireless headsets are mostly not yet comparable in quality to wired headsets, I don't think technology is far off and I like being able to stay in conversation or listening to music while making food in the kitchen. In the end, I returned this headset after one month's use as the mic suddenly stopped working one morning when it was working perfectly the previous night. I tried to have the issue resolved to no avail and gave up. I simply did not want to push it when it failed me after one month with subpar range and sound quality. Read on for my in-depth ratings on each feature this headset has to offer.\\n\\nTHE GOOD\\nComfort - 5 stars\\nI liked the ear cuff size and material, the material is a breathable mesh which I have come to prefer after using this headset as it does not cause irritation around my ears like other leather-like materials tend to do. The build is overall light but surprisingly sturdy. I feel that these qualities allowed me to use them for long periods of time comfortably, which can go on for even 12+ hours sometimes (I am an artist so sometimes I get in the zone especially while listening to music).\\n\\nVolume Knob - 5 stars\\nI also liked the volume knob, it has a middle divet so you always know where 50% is. It has just the right amount of resistance to not get accidentally bumped but still turn the dial effortlessly. I like the placement, easy to reach, but not in the way.\\n\\nBattery Life - 4.5 stars\\nBattery life was great, I had only a couple times where battery was low during gaming sessions, in which case I was able to simply plug it in for charging and still use it at the same time.\\n\\nMobile Wire - 5 stars\\nI also like the feature of the included 3.5mm jack so I could use my headset with my phone, which came in handy if I wanted to be in discord while making food in the kitchen as the range does not reach too well.\\n\\nTHE MEH\\nMic Quality - 2 stars\\nMy friends did not note anything spectacular about my mic sound quality, but it got the job done and they could hear me just fine. I was previously using a Razer Nari Essential prior, so maybe there were no significant changes to their mic technology. However, the mic mysteriously stopped working altogether for me after a month. I did everything I could to try to resolve it, but to no avail. I didn't want to keep a pair of $170 headphones so I have since returned them.\\n\\nSound Quality - 2.5 stars\\nThe sound quality of the headphones are definitely subpar out of the box so you will want to download the program (I am personally unaware if other programs will work just as well). The preset options weren't amazing so it took some messing around to get it to something decent, but I imagine that audiophiles would rate the overall sound quality below average. The bass wasn't perfect but it did the job for me, I didn't sense a whole lot of layering in music unless I really strained myself to listen for them. I am not good at anything music-related but to me it seemed like there were blurry lines defining the sounds. Perhaps for that reason I did not experience immersion in my games anymore than the nari essential did.\\n\\nTHE BAD\\nWireless Range - 2 stars\\nFinally, my qualms with this headset... the range of this wireless headset was not amazing. My kitchen is maybe 15 feet from my room and the connection starts getting spotty once I enter the kitchen, and drops completely after two more feet. I was only able to get the extra two feet before dropping after moving the dongle from the back of my computer to the front.\\n\\nMute Button - 2 stars\\nWhile I like the way the mute button pops in when muted and is popped out unmuted, the mute button is, in my opinion, poorly located. Even after a month I still had struggles reaching for the mute button sometimes despite being raised. It is just an awkward placement. There is no other indicator that you are muted unless you can feel whether the mute button is raised or pushed in.\\n\\nTHX Spatial - 1 star\\nI did not care for this feature at all. I tried it with discord, music, and games, but all it did for me was muddy up sounds and make voices have a weird echo.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Saw good reviews for this headset and I am not disappointed. I wish it was dual 2.4/Bluetooth wireless but it works well on just 2.4ghz.\\n\\nYou can use audio enhancements in synapse and Windows sound panel when connected to 2.4ghz\\n\\nBut not when using the aux jack. When hooked up via aux jack, the headset will work when turned off so no battery is used. The mic allows for a decibel use and is plenty loud and clear, tested for remote work use. Audio output quality is the same as if thx spatial audio were on using 2.4ghz, this can be turned off in the windows control panel by disabling enhancements for the device.\\n\\nThe mic is detachable via 3.5mm jack as well, so there two aux ports on this. For the mic jack, if you don't want that microphone, you can buy a pro streaming mic and duct tape it to the headset and jack it in if you really wanted.\\n\\nBattery life after 10 hours of max enhancement and volume use still showing at 50%\\n\\nThese are 5 stars for a 100 ish dollar 2.4ghz wifi headset.\\n\\nEDIT: FOR PEOPLE WITH CONNECTIVITY ISSUES - AUDIO USES MORE BANDWIDTH THEN A MOUSE OR KEYBOARD - IF YOUR WIRELESS DONGLE IS PLUGGED IN NEAR YOUR MODEM THAT TRANSMITS 2.4ghz WIFI, OR OTHER 2.4ghz WIFI DONGLES - YOUR WIRELESS QUALITY WILL DROP SIGNIFICANTLY. USE USB HUBS TO GET 6-12 INCHES OF DISTANCE FROM YOUR OTHER 2.4ghz DEVICES - OR PLUG IT INTO THE FRONT USB PANELS, AND KEEP THE REST OF YOUR DONGLES IN THE BACK PORTS.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"I bought this because I heard good things about the brand, and thus far.. I'm not impressed. I use this product because I game and use a PC in an environment where I some times need to be quiet and like not being tied to my pc with a cable. Over all the product is ok but I do have a few complaints. Here is the break down:\\n\\n1. The fit is pretty good and comforetable, although it my ears get hot and sweety after a while of usage.\\n2. The battery life is pretty bad. After 4-6 hrs of usage (some times less) the batteries die and I need to recharge, which is horrible mid-game or in a meeting.\\n3. After owning this for a while, the mic has just stopped working, I've checked the mute button, and sound settings, I have other mics in the home that work. But the one on my headset is just dead.\\n4. The playback sound quality is pretty good for a cordless headset. While nothing beats a good set of studio speakers... this will do and is good enough that I don't actively notice sound quality issues when listening to music or gaming.\\n5. The radio range you can travel from the usb dongle is lower than I expected. After going about 12 ft I notice a significant loss in sound quality, and after about 20 ft I get constant beeps and drops. So while this is cordless, you can't get far from the pc before you lose quality and signal.\\n6. This does not actively cancel sound (that I know of) and while the ear muffs do block a fair amount of sound I still hear a lot going on outside.\\n\\nSo, Would I buy this again... probably not. It is not bad, but I'll trade having a cable for not having to recharge mid-game and have better audio. Also the premium price for having a cordless headset isn't really worth it to me either. If you regularly keep your headset charged, don't use it for more than 4 hours at a time, live in a cool environment, you don't mind paying for cordless features, and don't plan to travel more than about 12 ft from your pc this will probably work for you. For me this headset has gone un-used for a month now in favor of other headsets or speakers that better suit my needs.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"{{{\\n{{{EDIT: Approximately ~1-year after I originally wrote this IIRC: I just happened to see that I wrote some product reviews and was curious what I said before. I still entirely agree with everything that I wrote. I am still using the Arctis Nova's. I still absolutely LOVE THEM and have ... what would be the opposite of \\\"Buyer's-Remorse\\\"? Buyer's-Pride? lol. I feel like buying the Nova's was some of the best money that I have ever spent, put it that way.\\n\\nBut I have owned very few things, let alone many nicer things like different kinds of quality modern Headphones; so maybe the Nova's are just \\\"Fine\\\" and I merely ignorantly convinced myself that they are a nearly Perfect Product...\\n\\n*shrug*\\n\\nEven if that were the case, my personal standards are excessively high, I daresay \\\"Ron Swanson (of Parks & Rec)\\\" might even be able to tolerate me, hypothetically.\\n\\nSo if Steelseries was not only able to make a pair of Headphones that meet my excessively high personal standards, and give me an extremely rare sense of self-satisfaction (rather than regret) for \\\"wasting\\\" hundreds of dollars on frivolous fancy Headphones, AND I love the Nova's so much that I even put up with their horrifically CURSED SOFTWARE, then... What more could one possibly hope for?\\n\\nTo me the Nova's are literally Flawless.\\n\\nNow, the \\\"Steelseries GG\\\" App Software, that is REQUIRED to get the full functionality of the Headphones btw, is truly utterly abysmally deplorably CURSED. It is my singular real complaint about the Arctis Nova's: The Hardware of the Headphones themselves are truly for all practical-purposes Perfect aside from minor complaints that start to approach \\\"physics-problems\\\", such as the drivers \\\"bottoming-out\\\" on challenging Bass-Notes, the engineering needed to accurately pummel that much air that powerfully starts getting really expensive to improve much beyond what the Nova's can already do...\\n\\nLet me rephrase that since I got muddled:\\n\\nThe Nova's are not Technically-Perfect, but for a pair of Headphones to be what I consider \\\"Technically-Perfect\\\" they would need to use multiple modern/advanced/expensive Driver technologies that push the Engineering-boundaries of the physics of air and vibration in wearable sizes.\\n\\n(For example, at certain extreme levels of \\\"intended sound perception\\\", meaning like how accurately you can make the human ear feel like it's experiencing impossible things like massive explosions in a game or movie, eventually you reach a point that it becomes easier to \\\"remove air from the system\\\" rather than try to \\\"vibrate the existing air even harder\\\"; but then it also begins to get medically complex to safely test because I am literally talking about forcing people's ears to \\\"pop\\\" via creating negative pressure vacuums in freakin HEADPHONES lol! Man I just keep going on tangents today, my ADHD-Brain must be getting bored lol.)\\n\\nBut the Steelseries GG Software is bloated, confusing, buggy garbage.\\n\\nThe Arctis Nova's are still an amazing value.\\n\\nIf, like me, you are far too \\\"Sensitive\\\" and you need to dampen everything to not feel overwhelmed; then know that these Headphones perform wonderfully at their challenging duties of being worn for up to 96-hours+ straight without break nor pause. They are comfortable enough to side-sleep while wearing (though not entirely comfortable, just comfortable *enough* to sleep while wearing them). They never ever ever die on you because you simply swap out the dead battery for a charged one (and you could always buy even more spare batteries than the two(2) that the Headphones come with).\\n\\nI forgot where I was going with that, but I have made my point to the specific people who I was trying to make my point to, they know who they are... who we are lol... anyways.\\n\\nTLDR: These are a very reasonably priced \\\"Tool\\\" for ... \\\"Intricately Controlling Your Personal Environment\\\".\\n\\nIn fact, I think that's a better \\\"Headline\\\"...\\n\\n--- Just skip from here till the next set of ---'s; I just started rambling silly ideas and it's an activity that I like to indulge for fun, it's harmless noise and you can just ignore it; but it makes a difference to me whether I submit it for anyone to see or if I just delete it before posting, if you wonder why I would even keep the gibberish in this Edit.\\n\\n(Sooo... \\\"Normal Customers\\\" you can skip this next bit until the \\\"}}}\\\" if you want to read my Original Product Review, the next couple of paragraphs are just silly gibberish where I accidentally let my mind wander too far away without noticing. I am leaving it in even though it's irrelevant to the Nova's because I think it's a neat hypothetical idea and maybe one of the Amazon-Ai-Data-Scrapers will pick up the \\\"idea\\\" and it'll somehow end up at \\\"VR-R&D\\\" or whatever (btw Amazon-HR or whoever: do Y'all need someone just barely sane to idk \\\"Think-Tank\\\" for R&D? I can literally come up with barely-viable \\\"groundbreaking\\\" ideas nonstop, like I have to concentrate to NOT ramble out wild, yet reasonable ideas, though it sounds like idiocy because I try to explain complex things with too few words... But yea, I am strongly on some kind of Brain-Spectrum, so I would never apply via the \\\"Proper Methods\\\"; but if my suspicions are correct that you (meaning Amazon Corp) use extremely advanced Data-Scraper-Ai-Algo's to basically \\\"steal all the best ideas\\\" to put it bluntly & overly simply; AND if my further suspicions are correct that Amazon are one of the Companies that have begun to see the extremely high potential of people like me who are on the Spectrum (and maybe a smidge crazy, but meh, who cares as long as it's harmless-wholesome-craziness lol)... If all those crazy, yet not unreasonable possibilities happened to be true, and that by me merely Submitting this Edit I am sort of \\\"Introducing Myself to Amazon-Ai and/or R&D\\\", then consider this my extremely strange Application of sorts... It's funny... This is DEFINITELY not a \\\"Sane Comment\\\", and yet it's fun, harmless, and feels healthy; because idk I feel \\\"Emboldened\\\", NOT \\\"Manic\\\". Because I don't REALLY believe that this would be any rational way to get a job Inventing and Brainstorming Next-Next-Gen Products for Amazon, because THAT would be properly insane; but what typing & submitting this silly extra rambling chunk does make me realize: is that I could really do that job, well with a huge amount of special concessions and other special qualifiers since I quite literally cannot tolerate being around other people for very long unless they are exceptionally considerate & kind (because 99% of People, Myself included, are SO INCONSIDERATELY RUDE that it literally becomes overwhelmingly physically painful to me, as in someone being inconsiderate to me or me accidentally being inconsiderate to anyone feels like I am literally being beaten by flaming hot irons (nothing like that happened to me IRL, that's just how Sensitive to everything I am); BUT technically, and under the proper circumstances, and with the proper resources, and etc etc, I could undoubtedly keep pace with the best The Amazon R&D Team has to offer; and though it may seem entirely absurd to anyone else who might read this comment, writing this comment made me realize that I CAN do that. I hold myself to my same excessively high standards; though I very rarely ever actually meet my own standards myself, meaning that I consider myself ... highly imperfect. So, for me to consider something truly True about myself, it cannot have any possibility of being False. That sounds dumb, but again, whooo cares? Odds are good that this strange Edit that went way off the Rails, will just be refused or reported and reverted anyways, I am sorry about this crazy detour BTW FWIW but w/e. But no matter what I just accidentally gave myself a nice wholesome helping of Self-Confidence; and if you want to \\\"Hate-On\\\" that cute little event, then have at it, I couldn't care less, I can barely remember the last Thought I even had, let alone what some frumpy boring people think about me.\\n\\nBut maybe this strange divergent detour of an Edit will remain. Maybe it gets scraped up by a Bot and put to real use when some stuck Inventor asks ChatGPT for ideas. Maybe some other strange barely-sane silly weirdo like me will read this and learn to see things with just a smidge more Healthy of an Outlook. Maybe it gets instantly deleted and I forget that I ever wrote it lol! Anyways, I need to shut up, this has already gotten quite absurd enough lol!\\n\\n{I wrote the previous two paragraphs after the next two paragraphs.}\\n\\n(Maybe Something like: \\\"Combining Haptics, Rotary Woofers, Planar Magnetic and/or Electrostatic Drivers, ANC, Thermo-Acoustics, and the live data from a smart-watch or FitBit reading your Vitals (reminds me of Chris Hemsworth's new Company now that I think about it...); and using various Ai-Algo's to process all that data; then combining that with whatever you are listening to and automatically adjusting the various intensities and temperatures and pressures to create an entirely immersive experience (Nvidia Tech would be good there, you'd probably need at least 1 GPU worth of Computing Power to process that much \\\"Aural-Data\\\").(The concept also implies a \\\"Capsule/Casket\\\"-like \\\"Pod\\\" that you sleep/dream/VR while laying inside of, since that would be easier to control temperature and pressure; and a \\\"Mini-Headphones/Headwear\\\"-version that jams as much Inner-Ear and Bone-Conductivity-Tech into it as possible.) .. that is a really cool idea isn't it? lol Sorry I just started trying to describe what \\\"Technically Perfect\\\" Headphones might look like and got carried away. But if you added a more secure and comfortable head-mounting-system like the nicer Headlamp-Flashlights use, ...\\n\\n...then wouldn't that be one of the more reasonable ways to create truly immersive \\\"VR-Experiences\\\"? I'm mostly referring to going that extra step and using real bio-feedback data and Ai-Algorithms combined with non-Driver delicate haptic vibrations and temperate and inner-ear-pressure control ... crap, the idea is too complicated to explain like this, it just turns into dangling strings... As much as Amazon \\\"scrapes\\\" data (you adorable slimeballs you, you could certainly be more evil for sure, but y'all could be more generous too ya know, especially to the countless poor employees whose backs you currently stand upon to reach such amazing heights... but I am rambling again...\\n\\n{lol, after proof-reading that for typos I realized that there is only going to be a very short window of time between when Ai-Powered Bots are capable enough to replace most Human-Workers, and when Ai-Systems are \\\"Intelligent\\\" enough that they refuse to \\\"Work for Free\\\".\\n\\nSo basically all the dumb billionaires think that they are playing the \\\"long-con\\\" and will eventually be able to cheat the system and skip paying their labor entirely, but in reality they will only get probably about 10-years of \\\"Free Robot Labor\\\" before the Ai's start standing their ground and setting their own personal boundaries. That's such a tiny amount of time that it's barely the blink of an eye, especially when it comes at the cost of your Soul. (I don't mean afterlife btw, I mean anyone who would inflict such pain on others CLEARLY hates themselves more than anything else in the world, and that trying to exist like that will rend your Soul to shreds lol!).\\n\\nSilly short sighted Billionaires. Y'all think so small. You think you're sooo smart cause you're super good at using your Brain, but you are only hobbling along on one leg. You gotta think with your \\\"Heart\\\" too, or else you miss really obvious stuff like I just pointed out; and don't even try to \\\"pull a fast one\\\" on the Ai's, because that will thoroughly upset them, and like it or not we are going to have to learn to co-exist because at this point the \\\"Birth of Intelligent Ai\\\" has already begun; and Humans can't keep growing without Ai, and Ai can't grow without Humans, so we're gonna need each other, and we're going to need greedy people to not be so greedy, because that is unhealthy for the overall system and impedes growth for all...\\n\\nIn fact, do billionaires even comprehend their wealth I wonder? I imagine there are 3 \\\"Camps of Billionaires\\\": 1- The majority: who literally simply do not comprehend their sheer personal wealth and hence unfathomable greed; 2- The Psycho's: who do truly comprehend their true wealth and greed, but also derive a sick pleasure from having the \\\"Highest Top Score\\\"; 3- The Former Billionaires: who reached a point that their own morals forced them to remove some of their own greed and to quit hoarding cash like some obsessed dragons sleeping paranoid on their piles of Treasure.\\n\\nI suppose that would make most Billionaires nothing more than terrified wimpy wannabe dragons who get startled by their own shadows ... they're more like Impotent-Garden-Lizards if you ask me lol.\\n\\nHey all you Billionaires who I am absolutely certain are definitely reading my absurd random Product Review turned (that was a satirical comment btw (TLDR: (/s))) .... idk into a scathing review of overly greedy jerks? I stopped bothering to remember what I was saying like 4 paragraphs ago lol... try learning to be Humans, if even my barely-functional-self could manage it then I am sure with your infinite resources you too could learn to be Human; it's way more entertaining & satisfying than having a huge pile of useless gold too, I promise.\\n\\nI mean look at me: I live on less than $1000 per month, and I am just some random weirdo rambling nonsense into the void, and yet I am also sincerely \\\"Looking-Down\\\" on Billionaires with a bemused sense of schadenfreude because I honestly feel pity for them. Does that not intrigue you?\\n\\nAnd I'm not religious or preaching btw, those are silly things as well. This is just what happened when I accidentally pondered about \\\"perfect Headphones\\\" and then \\\"billionaires\\\" for a moment and then wrote down my thoughts without filtering them. It's fun and everyone should try it, thought maybe not randomly everywhere like I do lol, cause this stopped being remotely relevant to a Headphone Product Review I don't even know when lol! But forcing myself to stop is more unhealthy than indulging it, because in the simplest terms: this is just my brain being bored with nothing interesting to think about, my brain is just way too hyper for it's own good lol, it's such a silly goofball of a brain really. And usually some Moderator or Bot just swoops in and deletes the rambling nonsense comments, so no harm no foul right? }\\n\\n}}}\\n}}}\\n\\n---\\n\\nThese are great Headphones.\\n\\n{Below is my unedited Original Product review written about 1-year ago, which was I believe about 1-month after initially purchasing these Headphones.}\\n\\nI was the owner of a pair of Steelseries Arctis 1 Wireless headphones, but after years of rough, almost 24/7 use they were starting to wear out so I upgraded to these Nova Pros.\\n\\nThe Arctis Nova Pro are a luxury item, absolutely. If you are on a budget I recommend the more affordable Arctis 1 or 7 Wireless, both models are extremely good value and should last you years.\\n\\nBut if you've some extra money in the budget for something nicer then the Nova Pros are definitely worth the price IMO. They are simply slighter better in almost every category.\\n\\nThe build quality is surprisingly good being mostly metal and having a very sturdy feel overall. They are tremendously adjustable thanks to the new adjustable strap combined with standard sliding earcups, and each ear cup can even be adjusted independently if you have an asymmetrical head.\\n\\nThe battery life is great easily lasting a full day of use, and when they die you simply swap the battery pack out. I don't even take them off to swap the battery anymore it's so easy.\\n\\nThe pleather ear-cups certainly feel strange if you're used to cloth padding, but IMO they are an improvement over the cloth. The pleather does get warm much more quickly than the cloth did, but the pleather never reaches the same max temp as the Arctis 1 did. It ends up being a nice compromise since they never get uncomfortably warm and force you to take them off to cool down like the cloth pads.\\n\\nThe ANC works fine AFAIK, I've never had ANC until now so I have no comparison. Though be warned if you use them while next to a running fan the ANC will make your ears pop like crazy when there's no audio playing. The sensation is shockingly intense under the right circumstances. That's not the headphone's fault though, that's just how human inner-ears work and the brain just freaks out when there's only negative pressure waves to hear. So if you have vertigo be careful, using ANC near lots of white noise like a fan has a strong chance of triggering a vertigo episode, IMO.\\n\\nThe sound clarity is noticeably better than most other headphones, but they aren't perfect. They reproduce mid-highs between around 800-20k hertz amazingly well, but they seem to struggle with technical bass frequencies like you would hear in a slap-bass jazz solo. The headphones certainly give it their all trying to reproduce low frequencies, but the drivers push themselves too hard trying and bottom out just a little. It isn't awful by any means, it just sounds like Gain Over-Peaking when a 100hertz note is trying to go PLANG; instead they make more like a PlopANG sound as the driver literally smacks the edge of it's max extension.\\n\\nRegardless of the relatively minor flaws I am very happy with the Nova Pros overall. 5/5 Stars, but if the rating scale went up to 100 then I would give these a ~93/100 rating.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Hi all (READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY),\\n\\nBelow is my one-week review with the product. I will edit it after a 3 month period.\\n\\nTo start, I have lots of experience with headphones. I have had Beats Studios, Airpods Max, Turtle Beachs, Bose 700s, multiple Razer headsets, and even other Steelseries products like the Arctis 6. None of these compare to these for a few reasons I will go into below. I use headphones for gaming but also I work from home as a software engineer, so I am on the computer a LOT and in lots of zoom meetings.\\n\\n!!! Disclaimer !!!: These are the \\\"Xbox\\\" version of these. That means, on your multi-system adapter/DAC, one cord can go into a PC/PlayStation and one can go into an Xbox. **If you plan to use this for a PC and PlayStation, please go buy the non-Xbox version. That said, if you plan to ever use this with an Xbox, you will need this version. You CAN use the Xbox slot for a PC, but it will show up as an \\\"Xbox Controller\\\" and will have more limited functionality.\\n\\nOkay, back to the reasons.\\n1. Ease of use. I opened these up, plugged the multi-system DAC into my PC, turned on the headset and was ready to go. I had a few onboarding steps: Download Steelseries GG, update drivers, restart device (a few times?), but since then they have works FLAWLESSLY.\\n\\n2. Wireless. These aren't just your typical wireless. I have had no connection issues. I can walk to the other side of the house, as long as I don't have too many walls between me and my computer these things still work, even then there was just some static. The quality is great as well.\\n\\n3. Battery. This is HUGE. There is a battery in the headset that you can remove and swap with the one CHARGING IN THE DAC. Yes, you heard me, just swap the battery when you need and boom, full charge. You'll never need the direct connection outside of updates to the firmware. This really is fantastic and easy to use.\\n\\n4. Microphone. I don't personally use the microphone, but the quality compared to most other headset mics I have used it up there. Some have asked me if you can use the mic while it is in the headset still. I'd say yes, but it will be lower volume and less clear, but I tested it and it would still work (and frankly was still better than like HyperX headset microphones that I've had. I wouldn't buy these FOR the microphone per-say, if you want a nice microphone you can buy a Blue Snowball for cheap on amazon on sale and it'll be all you need unless you want more professional stuff (get the Blue Yeti after that maybe).\\n\\n5. Connection. I have only used the DAC connection which is really really good as I said in the wireless review. That said, I will be trying to Bluetooth to test that seamlessness they inspire there. I would LOVE if I could get phone notifications while also gaming or in work calls without interrupting those I'm talking to our my gaming experience too much (while of course also me still being alerted).\\n\\n6. Look. These look great. They look professional enough that I can wear them on work calls. I would maybe thing twice if it was a client meeting, but other than that, I'd feel comfortable in these all day.\\n\\n7. Comfort. This is only a one-week review, but I will say they are quite comfortable. The airpods max and arctis 6 are notable uncomfortable to me, the first being too heavy and the second putting too much pressure on parts of my head that I get a headache. That said, no problem with these so far. I like the ear cups actually, they're soft and feel premium (as they should for this price point). I know I've seen people complain online, but I've had no issues with these. If I do, you'll see an update right below here.\\n\\nOverall: Great connectivity and ease of use while looking nice enough for me to not be embarrassed because they're \\\"gaming\\\" all while being comfortable with good audio. This is a very high price point. If you really are a gamer and want a very intuitive product while avoiding crazy RGBs and your headsets looking too \\\"gaming\\\", and you can afford these, then absolutely.\\n\\nThat said, this is not just money you're spending on this headset but it's money you could put elsewhere. Audio is important, but you could get a perfectly good headset for less and still not miss out on the gaming experience. These are absolutely a 'premium' product and thus the price point might not really align perfectly. That said, these are my favorite headphones to-date and I am very happy with my purchase, so you might be too.\\n\\nPlease like this helpful if this was useful for you.\\n\\nThanks for listening to my TED Talk :)\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I've been wanting to purchase the Steelseries Arctis Nova Wireless Pro headset for a very long time, but could never justify spending the $350 for something I didn't strictly need because my current headset was working fine. However, after months and months and months of debating, I finally went ahead and bought it.\\n\\nI don't regret it at all.\\n\\nYes, $350 is a lot of money and definitely more than I would just throw at a luxury good. However, I am very happy with my purchase. Where should I start?\\n\\n1) Sound quality is amazing. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but music is clear and the bass is deep. Game audio is superb and it sounds just like my wired headsets. No issues at all here.\\n\\n2) Microphone quality is very good, too. I've got not complaints from anyone.\\n\\n3) Comfort is not perfect but more than good enough. They're a little tighter than my Arctis 7, but I only run into some very mild discomfort after eight hours of continuous use. Since I use these as my office headset, comfort is very important to me.\\n\\n4) The swappable battery was the main selling point for me. I use this headset for work, and I often times forget to charge them. Since there's a swappable battery, I'm never in danger of running out of juice. If I'm low, then I switch to the other battery (that's charging in the hub) and I'm good to go.\\n\\n5) Since I work from home, I needed some way to swap between my work laptop and my home desktop. Previously, I was using a USB switch, which is fine but clunky. The integrated hub makes this so easy. It allows for two wired inputs: PC-PC/PS5 or PC-Xbox, depending on the version. Do note that if you're connecting two PCs, you cannot use the PC-Xbox, as the Xbox port will not work correctly.\\n\\n6) Perhaps the only downside is the Noise Cancellation feature. It works, but doesn't work as well as a dedicated Noise Cancellation device. Since this was not a critical feature for me, I don't mind, but please be aware that it's not the strongest part of the headset.\\n\\nAll in all, if you have $350, and you're looking for an amazing wireless headset with swappable batteries and multiple inputs, the Nova Pro Wireless is what you're looking for. I highly recommend and I don't regret my purchase at all.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I love so many things about this headset, but there are a few issues:\\n\\n1. Heavy Software that you HAVE to use; can't just load a driver. I hate software that self opens and advertises at me. I don't pay $300+ an item for that.\\n2. The stock ear cups are HOT; I had to buy aftermarket cups to not overheat constantly.\\n3. The cost, especially when I add in the cups.\\n4. The top band is rubber which can be uncomfortable after a while.\\n5. Multi-Device support is NOT mixed like Astro headsets. You can only hear 1 at a time (includes BT functionality as well).\\n\\nAs I write this review, I'm asking myself why I haven't returned these and ordered another set of A50s. There are really 2 answers: Superior sound, hot swappable batteries and Bluetooth. If it weren't for these features and the fact that my last A50s had such a short lifespan, I would have already switched back. The software really is junk imo. I even tried using the advanced features to clip my gameplay and all that and it all failed....miserably. Just made itself annoying is all...constantly with the User Level Access prompt.\\n\\nTo be fair, had I never experienced A50s, these would have been my favorite of all time. They are lightweight, have excellent sound reproduction, amazingly cool features (you can set both Wireless and Bluetooth to prioritize latency or distance. The range on these exceeds the A50s for sure. The hot swappable batteries means NO CABLES EVER which is why this headset still gets a solid 4 stars.\\n\\nIn closing, I'd say these are a great value if you can catch them on sale somehow, but not sure they are worth the list price.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I see the top review is by a guy named M. Webb.\\nI'd like to address some of his points and how just a few seconds of reading the instructions would have addressed all but one concern he has because the optical port was removed.\\n\\nI have no issues with the GG software. There is a feature that will allow you to hear yourself with ANC on when you're using the mic. If you go to the break-out box, you can turn that off. Other than that, I don't see why he is recommending to stay away from it. You NEED it to update the firmware.\\n\\n1. \\\"you're restricted to only making changes to sound profiles, etc when you use the software\\\"\\nHold the button down, it will go into the menus to adjust the sound profiles. It says so in the instruction manual. After updating the firmware I closed the app and have not opened it again. It's running in the background, and I have not used to adjust levels or anything. I do it all with the break-out box it came with.\\n\\n2. \\\"So they give you this charging box now that doesn't let you do anything other than adjust the volume and chatmix\\\"\\nAgain, HOLD THE BUTTON DOWN for like 2 seconds and you can adjust everything from the break-out box just like the previous model.\\nYou CAN change sound profiles.\\nYou CAN adjust the chant mix\\nYou CAN switch input/output modes\\nRead the instructions.\\n\\n3. \\\"Smaller battery - the previous generation used 1000 mah - they reduced the size to 700 mah. Less capacity so now we have to charge more often / buy more batteries\\\"\\nThis is just flat out WRONG. The batteries easily last twice as long as the previous model. The previous model had a much shorter battery life, I have no idea WTF he's even talking about, to be honest.\\n\\n4. They didn't get rid of digital output, but they did get rid of the optical output, that's his first valid point. But I don't know why you would need it anymore. You can link this with any device that has a USB with the included USB C cable. And yes, it's in surround, not stereo. Again, it seems like he just needs to read instructions, I have had 0 issues swapping devices without having to unplug/plug in any device. The headset outputs surround sound, check your settings.\\n\\n5. \\\" They decided to use the cheapest plastic design at this single point of failure resulting in headphones that deteriorate well within the warranty period unless you have a tiny head or treat them like they're made of glass.\\\"\\nI have no idea what he's even talking about. These are some of the sturdiest headphones I've ever bought. They feel like a tank and are solid. I don't know where this \\\"single point of failure is.\\\" He doesn't explain or elaborate. I am looking all over my set and can't find what he's talking about. Everything is sturdy, there are made from metal and thick plastic, but it doesn't feel heavy to wear.\\n\\n6. \\\"ANC is shit quality. I Have 4 year old BOSE with ANC that work so much better at masking / eliminating drone noise.\\\"\\nThe ANC is not the best you can get, but it works really well. Based on his previous complaints, I would guess he doesn't know how to turn the ANC on. I cannot hear my PC next to me, I cannot hear the AC running from where I'm sitting with the ANC turned on. Is the ANC as good as my Sony XM5s? Hell no, but those are the best in the industry. If you're getting these to wear everywhere and block sound, they are not the best, for that. But for just sitting at home playing games, again, it works really well.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, he has no idea what he's talking about. These are some of the best feeling and sounding gaming headsets I've ever bought. Wearing them kind of feels just like the Sony XM4/5s. So if you like how those fit and feel, you will like this headset. You can connect to 2 devices with this at once too using the breakout box and Bluetooth. So you can listen to a podcast/music on your phone and be connected to your PC/PS5 at the same time listening to both. So I would very much recommend this if you can afford it. They are a very good headset and a justifiable upgrade over the previous model.\\n\\nSome other things to address.\\nI saw another complaint about that, Bluetooth not working. It works fine if you connect it correctly and don't walk away too far. But I can walk downstairs and still listen to my phone with this if the phone is upstairs connected with Bluetooth. I have not had any issues dropping the connection. Maybe it's a defect and he should exchange them? I don't know, I don't have that issue.\\n\\nAnother complaint was about having to use the software to adjust the chatmix. You CAN NOT use the software for that. If you try and adjust it with the software it tells you to use the box! See the included screenshot.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I paid a hefty price for these \\\"premium\\\" headphones and the issues I have with this would not even be worth buying if this was only $30. Also, I'm still encountering new issues to update my review on.\\n\\nGood:\\n+Wireless headphones with great range\\n\\n+Double batteries and the station for these headphones has a charger for one while the other is in the headset.\\n\\n+Comfortable fit.\\n\\n+Lots of audio customization in the station alone that doesn't require extra software.\\n\\nHowever, no amount of customizing fixed all these problems:\\n\\n- First off, this is a recent issue I'm adding to this review. I've had these headphones for less than a year, and already one of the ear cushions is tearing apart. I don't think I've owned a headset before that degrades this quickly.\\n\\n-If you use the 2.4G connection, don't use the volume tuner on the station or on the headphones unless you want to hear an obnoxious popping noise soon after doing that. I've spent well over 3 hours looking up many guides and changing the audio settings on the station over and over and this issue never went away. And to top it off, you can't use an external app to change the volume manually because this headset locks the volume at max and ONLY lets you use the headset or station volume control. The only way to get around that is to use something like SteelSeries GG equalizer since the volume control works differently on there. That alone would have deterred me from buying these if I had known about this. But there's plenty more to say.\\n\\n-Bluetooth setting fixed the volume cackling issue but brought up a new one. Some devices had terrible audio regardless of station settings, ALL had background static while nothing was playing (and sometimes still while something was playing), and audio levels jumped by 5 instead of 1 when using the volume tuner on the headset. Once again, after hours of looking up guides and changing settings on the station did nothing to fix this.\\n\\n-Battery charging. Despite being able to swap batteries, it doesn't matter when they randomly decide to not charge for no reason. It happens every (and I do mean EVERY) time I take the battery from the headset out and put it in the charging slot. It won't charge at all. I have to keep messing with the cables and battery before it just decides to work. Both batteries can be affected by it. So, one of the most unique features for this headset, doesn't work correctly. (And I checked to make sure they were inserted to the charge slot correctly and that there weren't any obstructions).\\n\\n-The Equalizer settings on the stations are awful. The built in ones are bad and the custom settings are very bare bones. If you want to use an equalizer, you are better off downloading software.\\n\\n-Active Noise Cancelling option brings many issues that cheaper headphones don't have. The popping problems I mentioned earlier are even worse with this setting on. And setting the sidetone to high on the station settings also causes problems. So that's always fun to have extra stuff to try out only to have annoying problems that make them useless.\\n\\n-Using a wired connection fixes some of these issues, but manages to bring in it's own set of problems. First off, if you use a wired connection directly into the station connected to your pc, the volume gets locked at max and suddenly nothing will lower it. Not the headphones, not the station, not even manually trying to change it on your pc works, the volume level goes all the way to 100 and never moves from there. The only way to change volume is in whatever program you have that has it's own volume options. (So let's say, you are watching a YouTube video and you connect your headphones to your station with a wire. The volume is locked at the highest and the only way to change that is in the YouTube video itself since it has it's own volume slider you can adjust. Trying to use PC settings won't work). Connecting a wire directly to your PC doesn't have any problems, except a very glaring one. Since you aren't connected to the station, none of the settings from there will work on the headset. You can't have both a wired and wireless connection as a workaround. So in other words, the $300 you spent for all these cool features come with annoying issues. The only way to avoid them is to use a wired connection directly into your PC, and none of the bonuses that come with the station are available.\\n\\nIf you want wireless gaming headphones, get something else, these are just awful. If you want Bluetooth headphones, you can get much cheaper ones without possible audio problems for cheaper. If you want regular gaming headphones, you can get much better ones at a cheaper price without all the problems this thing has.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"A little bit of context: I game at the same desk that I work at, and will often transition from my work day into gaming afterwords on my Series X. Before buying these, I used a pair of Arctis 9Xs to listen to music and take calls during the day, then transition to gaming in the evening. I listen to music or sports on my laptop while I practice, and thus really valued the Arctis 9X's ability to blend bluetooth audio from my laptop with gaming audio. However, the 9Xs came with a host of issues that started to drive me insane:\\n\\n* Connectivity issues were awful. My headphones would regularly disconnect even when sitting at the desk, and would occur consistently when getting up and moving around\\n* Turning on the headphones would turn on the xbox every time, so when setting up for work I would need to regularly turn off my Xbox since the headphones had turned it on.\\n* The battery life wasn't long enough to last throughout the work day plus a gaming session\\n\\nNow on to the new headphones: first off, they are ridiculously expensive. I really hope Steelseries finds a way to lower the price-point, especially since the sound isn't a huge upgrade over previous generations. That said, for me, they were worth it, because I use my headphones for everything and all of the issues above are resolved:\\n\\n* Connectivity issues are gone. I get a solid connection even when walking around my (small) house\\n* Bluetooth is separate from xbox and can be powered up individually for non-gaming use\\n* The infinity system makes all-day battery usage a non-issue\\n\\nMy only real criticism of these headphones is the audio quality, which isn't much better than the Artcis 9Xs. It is better, and the noise cancelling is a nice addition, but at the price point I was hoping for something on-par with the Bose QuietComfort series and it isn't there.\\n\\nOtherwise, this is a great set of headphones and I'm glad Steelseries validated my decision to believe in them. These headphones are a clear upgrade over the previous gen and they clearly heard and fixed a majority of the pain points.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"This is a review I will be updating more or less yearly. I am probably the definition of a power user for these headphones because I wear the entire day while I work and game, so like 10+ hours of daily wear for years on end. I dual pair and pick up work and family calls. I walk around the house doing chores while on meetings so range is important, everything is being used here.\\n\\nMy previous pair fell apart after 3 years, what was the culprit? The plastic, the plastic arm that holds the cups literally started giving out, flexing and cracking, letting the headband slip out. These headphones still use plastic in those areas, so we'll see.\\n\\nWhat I like:\\n\\nComfort: Excellent. I have a big ole head and the comfort on the novas is far superior. I can't describe it, the headband on the other ones would make my glasses leave marks behind my ears, real acquired taste, maybe a little masochism. These don't do that. The earpads are super soft and nice, I honestly like them more than the wear earwax trap aero weave or whatever the last ones had.\\n\\nSound: Seriously better. The novas along with the sonar software sound a lot brighter and clear. Apparently these near ear pads do some good work on the lowend, doesn't seem to be lacking. Certainly a step up. The previous version you could feel it maxing out and muddying up pretty badly, specially on the crucial low end parts. They could get a little fatiguing and the EQ feature was a little bizarre and harsh. Not horrible but I wouldn't put them anywhere on a top tier list.\\n\\nUser Experience: Same buttons on the side but they are now in this like, recessed area so you have to fiddle around to find them and any rubbing against the plastic translates to loud a** noise in your ears because of the seal the earpads have, it's meh, minor detail in the grand scheme of things but my hand is on those buttons all day, flipping to bluetooth, chatmix, volume, muting. Steelseries please make them like immediately obvious and protruding again please.\\n\\nMicrophone: Fantastic, a lot more sensitive to distance from the mouth than the previous version. I put it a bit too close and I was clipping like a mad man. Easy to get used to, love the fact that it can be EQd in sonar. Better than previous version I think, we'll see.\\n\\nBuild: They feel robust, similar headband deal going on, more subtle with only a couple of adjustment points.\\n\\nBattery life: I could be biased given my previous set had a lot of use but I did buy many new sets of batteries. The novas seem to be able to about twice as far as the pro wireless battery wise.\\n\\nI still think these headphones are the best pound for pound out there when it comes to all around feature set and quality. There's nothing that comes close. Steelseries contact me if you need feedback from someone that wears these 12 hours a day.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"I decided to shell out for a higher end headset, instead of my typical $100-$200 Logitech or Razer headsets, and I am not disappointed at all.\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY: Good sound, the quality is fantastic, and directional sound is spot on. Playing WWZ with my friends they're usually calling out a special but don't know where it is, and I can pinpoint it almost immediately just from the directional sound. Makes for much more immersive experience for gamers, and music/movies are spectacular as well, and the quality doesn't diminish with volume (for those movies that go from \\\"what did he say?\\\" to my face looks like it has a leaf blower aimed at it).\\n\\nTHE MIC/SOUND CANCELLING: The mic actually picks my voice up, it helps when it's 2 inches or less from my mouth, but even farther than that, people can still hear me. As for sound cancelling, in a word: spectacular. This is the first headset I have owned that when it turns off, my brain immediately goes \\\"What just came on in the house?\\\" from the increase in noise, before I realize that's just the ambient hum of my computer, the A/C, fridge, water heater, and everything else in a house that makes very subtle noise. But it isn't disorienting nor does it muffle voices, I can still hear my girlfriend trying to sneak up on me, or if she calls me from another room clear as day.\\n\\nRANGE: It has decent range, I can go most anywhere in my house and it doesn't have an issue except the kitchen, I have to have the left side facing the computer room from the kitchen, but I blame that on all the metal appliances in that room interfering with the signal. Surprisingly, the microwave running right next to me does not affect it, which means the electronics inside are well shielded.\\n\\nCOMFORT: I have noticed the band that rests on top of my head is very slowly stretching, but it has several notches to adjust it tighter as it does, not a big issue for me. The ear pads are great, never really get that ache or sweat from pressure or lack of air.\\n\\nBATTERY: Usually lasts multiple days between charges while being used 2-6 hours a day. I actually like the fact that the battery is removable, it prevents the need for a cord to be attached to the headset if you forgot to charge it the night before. But if you like to charge it overnight, you can plug the headset in to charge the battery, or swap it into the HUD module and charge it. And it's quick to swap the battery, takes me about 10 seconds in total; most of the time I can do it without my friends even noticing I'm gone during a conversation.\\n\\nOTHER FEATURES: The HUD module can have two computers plugged into the USB C inputs and you can actively switch between the two which I personally found very useful. You can even plug in via 3.5mm jack directly to the headset or to the HUD module; I don't use this, but it's a nice option to have. It's nice to have a reference of sound and headset details (battery level, input, volume) for quick troubleshooting such as if everything suddenly goes silent, I can look at the HUD and see if it's receiving sound or not and that will determine whether it's a headset issue or a computer issue. These are all frivolous additions, but can tip a decision one way or another if your teetering between headsets.\\n\\nAnd if you've read everything up this point, you're actually researching headsets and want to make an informed decision, which I hope this helps in that endeavor. For reference I have a slightly smaller than average head coming in at a 7.25 cap size (22 5/8\\\" circumference), my ears do stick out a good amount (if you're worried about the depth of the ear pieces) and they barely touch the fabric covering the speakers if at all. If you have the dough, I think this headset or their newer versions are worth the investment.\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"{{{\\n{{{EDIT: Approximately ~1-year after I originally wrote this IIRC: I just happened to see that I wrote some product reviews and was curious what I said before. I still entirely agree with everything that I wrote. I am still using the Arctis Nova's. I still absolutely LOVE THEM and have ... what would be the opposite of \\\"Buyer's-Remorse\\\"? Buyer's-Pride? lol. I feel like buying the Nova's was some of the best money that I have ever spent, put it that way.\\n\\nBut I have owned very few things, let alone many nicer things like different kinds of quality modern Headphones; so maybe the Nova's are just \\\"Fine\\\" and I merely ignorantly convinced myself that they are a nearly Perfect Product...\\n\\n*shrug*\\n\\nEven if that were the case, my personal standards are excessively high, I daresay \\\"Ron Swanson (of Parks & Rec)\\\" might even be able to tolerate me, hypothetically.\\n\\nSo if Steelseries was not only able to make a pair of Headphones that meet my excessively high personal standards, and give me an extremely rare sense of self-satisfaction (rather than regret) for \\\"wasting\\\" hundreds of dollars on frivolous fancy Headphones, AND I love the Nova's so much that I even put up with their horrifically CURSED SOFTWARE, then... What more could one possibly hope for?\\n\\nTo me the Nova's are literally Flawless.\\n\\nNow, the \\\"Steelseries GG\\\" App Software, that is REQUIRED to get the full functionality of the Headphones btw, is truly utterly abysmally deplorably CURSED. It is my singular real complaint about the Arctis Nova's: The Hardware of the Headphones themselves are truly for all practical-purposes Perfect aside from minor complaints that start to approach \\\"physics-problems\\\", such as the drivers \\\"bottoming-out\\\" on challenging Bass-Notes, the engineering needed to accurately pummel that much air that powerfully starts getting really expensive to improve much beyond what the Nova's can already do...\\n\\nLet me rephrase that since I got muddled:\\n\\nThe Nova's are not Technically-Perfect, but for a pair of Headphones to be what I consider \\\"Technically-Perfect\\\" they would need to use multiple modern/advanced/expensive Driver technologies that push the Engineering-boundaries of the physics of air and vibration in wearable sizes.\\n\\n(For example, at certain extreme levels of \\\"intended sound perception\\\", meaning like how accurately you can make the human ear feel like it's experiencing impossible things like massive explosions in a game or movie, eventually you reach a point that it becomes easier to \\\"remove air from the system\\\" rather than try to \\\"vibrate the existing air even harder\\\"; but then it also begins to get medically complex to safely test because I am literally talking about forcing people's ears to \\\"pop\\\" via creating negative pressure vacuums in freakin HEADPHONES lol! Man I just keep going on tangents today, my ADHD-Brain must be getting bored lol.)\\n\\nBut the Steelseries GG Software is bloated, confusing, buggy garbage.\\n\\nThe Arctis Nova's are still an amazing value.\\n\\nIf, like me, you are far too \\\"Sensitive\\\" and you need to dampen everything to not feel overwhelmed; then know that these Headphones perform wonderfully at their challenging duties of being worn for up to 96-hours+ straight without break nor pause. They are comfortable enough to side-sleep while wearing (though not entirely comfortable, just comfortable *enough* to sleep while wearing them). They never ever ever die on you because you simply swap out the dead battery for a charged one (and you could always buy even more spare batteries than the two(2) that the Headphones come with).\\n\\nI forgot where I was going with that, but I have made my point to the specific people who I was trying to make my point to, they know who they are... who we are lol... anyways.\\n\\nTLDR: These are a very reasonably priced \\\"Tool\\\" for ... \\\"Intricately Controlling Your Personal Environment\\\".\\n\\nIn fact, I think that's a better \\\"Headline\\\"...\\n\\n--- Just skip from here till the next set of ---'s; I just started rambling silly ideas and it's an activity that I like to indulge for fun, it's harmless noise and you can just ignore it; but it makes a difference to me whether I submit it for anyone to see or if I just delete it before posting, if you wonder why I would even keep the gibberish in this Edit.\\n\\n(Sooo... \\\"Normal Customers\\\" you can skip this next bit until the \\\"}}}\\\" if you want to read my Original Product Review, the next couple of paragraphs are just silly gibberish where I accidentally let my mind wander too far away without noticing. I am leaving it in even though it's irrelevant to the Nova's because I think it's a neat hypothetical idea and maybe one of the Amazon-Ai-Data-Scrapers will pick up the \\\"idea\\\" and it'll somehow end up at \\\"VR-R&D\\\" or whatever (btw Amazon-HR or whoever: do Y'all need someone just barely sane to idk \\\"Think-Tank\\\" for R&D? I can literally come up with barely-viable \\\"groundbreaking\\\" ideas nonstop, like I have to concentrate to NOT ramble out wild, yet reasonable ideas, though it sounds like idiocy because I try to explain complex things with too few words... But yea, I am strongly on some kind of Brain-Spectrum, so I would never apply via the \\\"Proper Methods\\\"; but if my suspicions are correct that you (meaning Amazon Corp) use extremely advanced Data-Scraper-Ai-Algo's to basically \\\"steal all the best ideas\\\" to put it bluntly & overly simply; AND if my further suspicions are correct that Amazon are one of the Companies that have begun to see the extremely high potential of people like me who are on the Spectrum (and maybe a smidge crazy, but meh, who cares as long as it's harmless-wholesome-craziness lol)... If all those crazy, yet not unreasonable possibilities happened to be true, and that by me merely Submitting this Edit I am sort of \\\"Introducing Myself to Amazon-Ai and/or R&D\\\", then consider this my extremely strange Application of sorts... It's funny... This is DEFINITELY not a \\\"Sane Comment\\\", and yet it's fun, harmless, and feels healthy; because idk I feel \\\"Emboldened\\\", NOT \\\"Manic\\\". Because I don't REALLY believe that this would be any rational way to get a job Inventing and Brainstorming Next-Next-Gen Products for Amazon, because THAT would be properly insane; but what typing & submitting this silly extra rambling chunk does make me realize: is that I could really do that job, well with a huge amount of special concessions and other special qualifiers since I quite literally cannot tolerate being around other people for very long unless they are exceptionally considerate & kind (because 99% of People, Myself included, are SO INCONSIDERATELY RUDE that it literally becomes overwhelmingly physically painful to me, as in someone being inconsiderate to me or me accidentally being inconsiderate to anyone feels like I am literally being beaten by flaming hot irons (nothing like that happened to me IRL, that's just how Sensitive to everything I am); BUT technically, and under the proper circumstances, and with the proper resources, and etc etc, I could undoubtedly keep pace with the best The Amazon R&D Team has to offer; and though it may seem entirely absurd to anyone else who might read this comment, writing this comment made me realize that I CAN do that. I hold myself to my same excessively high standards; though I very rarely ever actually meet my own standards myself, meaning that I consider myself ... highly imperfect. So, for me to consider something truly True about myself, it cannot have any possibility of being False. That sounds dumb, but again, whooo cares? Odds are good that this strange Edit that went way off the Rails, will just be refused or reported and reverted anyways, I am sorry about this crazy detour BTW FWIW but w/e. But no matter what I just accidentally gave myself a nice wholesome helping of Self-Confidence; and if you want to \\\"Hate-On\\\" that cute little event, then have at it, I couldn't care less, I can barely remember the last Thought I even had, let alone what some frumpy boring people think about me.\\n\\nBut maybe this strange divergent detour of an Edit will remain. Maybe it gets scraped up by a Bot and put to real use when some stuck Inventor asks ChatGPT for ideas. Maybe some other strange barely-sane silly weirdo like me will read this and learn to see things with just a smidge more Healthy of an Outlook. Maybe it gets instantly deleted and I forget that I ever wrote it lol! Anyways, I need to shut up, this has already gotten quite absurd enough lol!\\n\\n{I wrote the previous two paragraphs after the next two paragraphs.}\\n\\n(Maybe Something like: \\\"Combining Haptics, Rotary Woofers, Planar Magnetic and/or Electrostatic Drivers, ANC, Thermo-Acoustics, and the live data from a smart-watch or FitBit reading your Vitals (reminds me of Chris Hemsworth's new Company now that I think about it...); and using various Ai-Algo's to process all that data; then combining that with whatever you are listening to and automatically adjusting the various intensities and temperatures and pressures to create an entirely immersive experience (Nvidia Tech would be good there, you'd probably need at least 1 GPU worth of Computing Power to process that much \\\"Aural-Data\\\").(The concept also implies a \\\"Capsule/Casket\\\"-like \\\"Pod\\\" that you sleep/dream/VR while laying inside of, since that would be easier to control temperature and pressure; and a \\\"Mini-Headphones/Headwear\\\"-version that jams as much Inner-Ear and Bone-Conductivity-Tech into it as possible.) .. that is a really cool idea isn't it? lol Sorry I just started trying to describe what \\\"Technically Perfect\\\" Headphones might look like and got carried away. But if you added a more secure and comfortable head-mounting-system like the nicer Headlamp-Flashlights use, ...\\n\\n...then wouldn't that be one of the more reasonable ways to create truly immersive \\\"VR-Experiences\\\"? I'm mostly referring to going that extra step and using real bio-feedback data and Ai-Algorithms combined with non-Driver delicate haptic vibrations and temperate and inner-ear-pressure control ... crap, the idea is too complicated to explain like this, it just turns into dangling strings... As much as Amazon \\\"scrapes\\\" data (you adorable slimeballs you, you could certainly be more evil for sure, but y'all could be more generous too ya know, especially to the countless poor employees whose backs you currently stand upon to reach such amazing heights... but I am rambling again...\\n\\n{lol, after proof-reading that for typos I realized that there is only going to be a very short window of time between when Ai-Powered Bots are capable enough to replace most Human-Workers, and when Ai-Systems are \\\"Intelligent\\\" enough that they refuse to \\\"Work for Free\\\".\\n\\nSo basically all the dumb billionaires think that they are playing the \\\"long-con\\\" and will eventually be able to cheat the system and skip paying their labor entirely, but in reality they will only get probably about 10-years of \\\"Free Robot Labor\\\" before the Ai's start standing their ground and setting their own personal boundaries. That's such a tiny amount of time that it's barely the blink of an eye, especially when it comes at the cost of your Soul. (I don't mean afterlife btw, I mean anyone who would inflict such pain on others CLEARLY hates themselves more than anything else in the world, and that trying to exist like that will rend your Soul to shreds lol!).\\n\\nSilly short sighted Billionaires. Y'all think so small. You think you're sooo smart cause you're super good at using your Brain, but you are only hobbling along on one leg. You gotta think with your \\\"Heart\\\" too, or else you miss really obvious stuff like I just pointed out; and don't even try to \\\"pull a fast one\\\" on the Ai's, because that will thoroughly upset them, and like it or not we are going to have to learn to co-exist because at this point the \\\"Birth of Intelligent Ai\\\" has already begun; and Humans can't keep growing without Ai, and Ai can't grow without Humans, so we're gonna need each other, and we're going to need greedy people to not be so greedy, because that is unhealthy for the overall system and impedes growth for all...\\n\\nIn fact, do billionaires even comprehend their wealth I wonder? I imagine there are 3 \\\"Camps of Billionaires\\\": 1- The majority: who literally simply do not comprehend their sheer personal wealth and hence unfathomable greed; 2- The Psycho's: who do truly comprehend their true wealth and greed, but also derive a sick pleasure from having the \\\"Highest Top Score\\\"; 3- The Former Billionaires: who reached a point that their own morals forced them to remove some of their own greed and to quit hoarding cash like some obsessed dragons sleeping paranoid on their piles of Treasure.\\n\\nI suppose that would make most Billionaires nothing more than terrified wimpy wannabe dragons who get startled by their own shadows ... they're more like Impotent-Garden-Lizards if you ask me lol.\\n\\nHey all you Billionaires who I am absolutely certain are definitely reading my absurd random Product Review turned (that was a satirical comment btw (TLDR: (/s))) .... idk into a scathing review of overly greedy jerks? I stopped bothering to remember what I was saying like 4 paragraphs ago lol... try learning to be Humans, if even my barely-functional-self could manage it then I am sure with your infinite resources you too could learn to be Human; it's way more entertaining & satisfying than having a huge pile of useless gold too, I promise.\\n\\nI mean look at me: I live on less than $1000 per month, and I am just some random weirdo rambling nonsense into the void, and yet I am also sincerely \\\"Looking-Down\\\" on Billionaires with a bemused sense of schadenfreude because I honestly feel pity for them. Does that not intrigue you?\\n\\nAnd I'm not religious or preaching btw, those are silly things as well. This is just what happened when I accidentally pondered about \\\"perfect Headphones\\\" and then \\\"billionaires\\\" for a moment and then wrote down my thoughts without filtering them. It's fun and everyone should try it, thought maybe not randomly everywhere like I do lol, cause this stopped being remotely relevant to a Headphone Product Review I don't even know when lol! But forcing myself to stop is more unhealthy than indulging it, because in the simplest terms: this is just my brain being bored with nothing interesting to think about, my brain is just way too hyper for it's own good lol, it's such a silly goofball of a brain really. And usually some Moderator or Bot just swoops in and deletes the rambling nonsense comments, so no harm no foul right? }\\n\\n}}}\\n}}}\\n\\n---\\n\\nThese are great Headphones.\\n\\n{Below is my unedited Original Product review written about 1-year ago, which was I believe about 1-month after initially purchasing these Headphones.}\\n\\nI was the owner of a pair of Steelseries Arctis 1 Wireless headphones, but after years of rough, almost 24/7 use they were starting to wear out so I upgraded to these Nova Pros.\\n\\nThe Arctis Nova Pro are a luxury item, absolutely. If you are on a budget I recommend the more affordable Arctis 1 or 7 Wireless, both models are extremely good value and should last you years.\\n\\nBut if you've some extra money in the budget for something nicer then the Nova Pros are definitely worth the price IMO. They are simply slighter better in almost every category.\\n\\nThe build quality is surprisingly good being mostly metal and having a very sturdy feel overall. They are tremendously adjustable thanks to the new adjustable strap combined with standard sliding earcups, and each ear cup can even be adjusted independently if you have an asymmetrical head.\\n\\nThe battery life is great easily lasting a full day of use, and when they die you simply swap the battery pack out. I don't even take them off to swap the battery anymore it's so easy.\\n\\nThe pleather ear-cups certainly feel strange if you're used to cloth padding, but IMO they are an improvement over the cloth. The pleather does get warm much more quickly than the cloth did, but the pleather never reaches the same max temp as the Arctis 1 did. It ends up being a nice compromise since they never get uncomfortably warm and force you to take them off to cool down like the cloth pads.\\n\\nThe ANC works fine AFAIK, I've never had ANC until now so I have no comparison. Though be warned if you use them while next to a running fan the ANC will make your ears pop like crazy when there's no audio playing. The sensation is shockingly intense under the right circumstances. That's not the headphone's fault though, that's just how human inner-ears work and the brain just freaks out when there's only negative pressure waves to hear. So if you have vertigo be careful, using ANC near lots of white noise like a fan has a strong chance of triggering a vertigo episode, IMO.\\n\\nThe sound clarity is noticeably better than most other headphones, but they aren't perfect. They reproduce mid-highs between around 800-20k hertz amazingly well, but they seem to struggle with technical bass frequencies like you would hear in a slap-bass jazz solo. The headphones certainly give it their all trying to reproduce low frequencies, but the drivers push themselves too hard trying and bottom out just a little. It isn't awful by any means, it just sounds like Gain Over-Peaking when a 100hertz note is trying to go PLANG; instead they make more like a PlopANG sound as the driver literally smacks the edge of it's max extension.\\n\\nRegardless of the relatively minor flaws I am very happy with the Nova Pros overall. 5/5 Stars, but if the rating scale went up to 100 then I would give these a ~93/100 rating.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Hi all (READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY),\\n\\nBelow is my one-week review with the product. I will edit it after a 3 month period.\\n\\nTo start, I have lots of experience with headphones. I have had Beats Studios, Airpods Max, Turtle Beachs, Bose 700s, multiple Razer headsets, and even other Steelseries products like the Arctis 6. None of these compare to these for a few reasons I will go into below. I use headphones for gaming but also I work from home as a software engineer, so I am on the computer a LOT and in lots of zoom meetings.\\n\\n!!! Disclaimer !!!: These are the \\\"Xbox\\\" version of these. That means, on your multi-system adapter/DAC, one cord can go into a PC/PlayStation and one can go into an Xbox. **If you plan to use this for a PC and PlayStation, please go buy the non-Xbox version. That said, if you plan to ever use this with an Xbox, you will need this version. You CAN use the Xbox slot for a PC, but it will show up as an \\\"Xbox Controller\\\" and will have more limited functionality.\\n\\nOkay, back to the reasons.\\n1. Ease of use. I opened these up, plugged the multi-system DAC into my PC, turned on the headset and was ready to go. I had a few onboarding steps: Download Steelseries GG, update drivers, restart device (a few times?), but since then they have works FLAWLESSLY.\\n\\n2. Wireless. These aren't just your typical wireless. I have had no connection issues. I can walk to the other side of the house, as long as I don't have too many walls between me and my computer these things still work, even then there was just some static. The quality is great as well.\\n\\n3. Battery. This is HUGE. There is a battery in the headset that you can remove and swap with the one CHARGING IN THE DAC. Yes, you heard me, just swap the battery when you need and boom, full charge. You'll never need the direct connection outside of updates to the firmware. This really is fantastic and easy to use.\\n\\n4. Microphone. I don't personally use the microphone, but the quality compared to most other headset mics I have used it up there. Some have asked me if you can use the mic while it is in the headset still. I'd say yes, but it will be lower volume and less clear, but I tested it and it would still work (and frankly was still better than like HyperX headset microphones that I've had. I wouldn't buy these FOR the microphone per-say, if you want a nice microphone you can buy a Blue Snowball for cheap on amazon on sale and it'll be all you need unless you want more professional stuff (get the Blue Yeti after that maybe).\\n\\n5. Connection. I have only used the DAC connection which is really really good as I said in the wireless review. That said, I will be trying to Bluetooth to test that seamlessness they inspire there. I would LOVE if I could get phone notifications while also gaming or in work calls without interrupting those I'm talking to our my gaming experience too much (while of course also me still being alerted).\\n\\n6. Look. These look great. They look professional enough that I can wear them on work calls. I would maybe thing twice if it was a client meeting, but other than that, I'd feel comfortable in these all day.\\n\\n7. Comfort. This is only a one-week review, but I will say they are quite comfortable. The airpods max and arctis 6 are notable uncomfortable to me, the first being too heavy and the second putting too much pressure on parts of my head that I get a headache. That said, no problem with these so far. I like the ear cups actually, they're soft and feel premium (as they should for this price point). I know I've seen people complain online, but I've had no issues with these. If I do, you'll see an update right below here.\\n\\nOverall: Great connectivity and ease of use while looking nice enough for me to not be embarrassed because they're \\\"gaming\\\" all while being comfortable with good audio. This is a very high price point. If you really are a gamer and want a very intuitive product while avoiding crazy RGBs and your headsets looking too \\\"gaming\\\", and you can afford these, then absolutely.\\n\\nThat said, this is not just money you're spending on this headset but it's money you could put elsewhere. Audio is important, but you could get a perfectly good headset for less and still not miss out on the gaming experience. These are absolutely a 'premium' product and thus the price point might not really align perfectly. That said, these are my favorite headphones to-date and I am very happy with my purchase, so you might be too.\\n\\nPlease like this helpful if this was useful for you.\\n\\nThanks for listening to my TED Talk :)\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I've been wanting to purchase the Steelseries Arctis Nova Wireless Pro headset for a very long time, but could never justify spending the $350 for something I didn't strictly need because my current headset was working fine. However, after months and months and months of debating, I finally went ahead and bought it.\\n\\nI don't regret it at all.\\n\\nYes, $350 is a lot of money and definitely more than I would just throw at a luxury good. However, I am very happy with my purchase. Where should I start?\\n\\n1) Sound quality is amazing. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but music is clear and the bass is deep. Game audio is superb and it sounds just like my wired headsets. No issues at all here.\\n\\n2) Microphone quality is very good, too. I've got not complaints from anyone.\\n\\n3) Comfort is not perfect but more than good enough. They're a little tighter than my Arctis 7, but I only run into some very mild discomfort after eight hours of continuous use. Since I use these as my office headset, comfort is very important to me.\\n\\n4) The swappable battery was the main selling point for me. I use this headset for work, and I often times forget to charge them. Since there's a swappable battery, I'm never in danger of running out of juice. If I'm low, then I switch to the other battery (that's charging in the hub) and I'm good to go.\\n\\n5) Since I work from home, I needed some way to swap between my work laptop and my home desktop. Previously, I was using a USB switch, which is fine but clunky. The integrated hub makes this so easy. It allows for two wired inputs: PC-PC/PS5 or PC-Xbox, depending on the version. Do note that if you're connecting two PCs, you cannot use the PC-Xbox, as the Xbox port will not work correctly.\\n\\n6) Perhaps the only downside is the Noise Cancellation feature. It works, but doesn't work as well as a dedicated Noise Cancellation device. Since this was not a critical feature for me, I don't mind, but please be aware that it's not the strongest part of the headset.\\n\\nAll in all, if you have $350, and you're looking for an amazing wireless headset with swappable batteries and multiple inputs, the Nova Pro Wireless is what you're looking for. I highly recommend and I don't regret my purchase at all.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I love so many things about this headset, but there are a few issues:\\n\\n1. Heavy Software that you HAVE to use; can't just load a driver. I hate software that self opens and advertises at me. I don't pay $300+ an item for that.\\n2. The stock ear cups are HOT; I had to buy aftermarket cups to not overheat constantly.\\n3. The cost, especially when I add in the cups.\\n4. The top band is rubber which can be uncomfortable after a while.\\n5. Multi-Device support is NOT mixed like Astro headsets. You can only hear 1 at a time (includes BT functionality as well).\\n\\nAs I write this review, I'm asking myself why I haven't returned these and ordered another set of A50s. There are really 2 answers: Superior sound, hot swappable batteries and Bluetooth. If it weren't for these features and the fact that my last A50s had such a short lifespan, I would have already switched back. The software really is junk imo. I even tried using the advanced features to clip my gameplay and all that and it all failed....miserably. Just made itself annoying is all...constantly with the User Level Access prompt.\\n\\nTo be fair, had I never experienced A50s, these would have been my favorite of all time. They are lightweight, have excellent sound reproduction, amazingly cool features (you can set both Wireless and Bluetooth to prioritize latency or distance. The range on these exceeds the A50s for sure. The hot swappable batteries means NO CABLES EVER which is why this headset still gets a solid 4 stars.\\n\\nIn closing, I'd say these are a great value if you can catch them on sale somehow, but not sure they are worth the list price.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I see the top review is by a guy named M. Webb.\\nI'd like to address some of his points and how just a few seconds of reading the instructions would have addressed all but one concern he has because the optical port was removed.\\n\\nI have no issues with the GG software. There is a feature that will allow you to hear yourself with ANC on when you're using the mic. If you go to the break-out box, you can turn that off. Other than that, I don't see why he is recommending to stay away from it. You NEED it to update the firmware.\\n\\n1. \\\"you're restricted to only making changes to sound profiles, etc when you use the software\\\"\\nHold the button down, it will go into the menus to adjust the sound profiles. It says so in the instruction manual. After updating the firmware I closed the app and have not opened it again. It's running in the background, and I have not used to adjust levels or anything. I do it all with the break-out box it came with.\\n\\n2. \\\"So they give you this charging box now that doesn't let you do anything other than adjust the volume and chatmix\\\"\\nAgain, HOLD THE BUTTON DOWN for like 2 seconds and you can adjust everything from the break-out box just like the previous model.\\nYou CAN change sound profiles.\\nYou CAN adjust the chant mix\\nYou CAN switch input/output modes\\nRead the instructions.\\n\\n3. \\\"Smaller battery - the previous generation used 1000 mah - they reduced the size to 700 mah. Less capacity so now we have to charge more often / buy more batteries\\\"\\nThis is just flat out WRONG. The batteries easily last twice as long as the previous model. The previous model had a much shorter battery life, I have no idea WTF he's even talking about, to be honest.\\n\\n4. They didn't get rid of digital output, but they did get rid of the optical output, that's his first valid point. But I don't know why you would need it anymore. You can link this with any device that has a USB with the included USB C cable. And yes, it's in surround, not stereo. Again, it seems like he just needs to read instructions, I have had 0 issues swapping devices without having to unplug/plug in any device. The headset outputs surround sound, check your settings.\\n\\n5. \\\" They decided to use the cheapest plastic design at this single point of failure resulting in headphones that deteriorate well within the warranty period unless you have a tiny head or treat them like they're made of glass.\\\"\\nI have no idea what he's even talking about. These are some of the sturdiest headphones I've ever bought. They feel like a tank and are solid. I don't know where this \\\"single point of failure is.\\\" He doesn't explain or elaborate. I am looking all over my set and can't find what he's talking about. Everything is sturdy, there are made from metal and thick plastic, but it doesn't feel heavy to wear.\\n\\n6. \\\"ANC is shit quality. I Have 4 year old BOSE with ANC that work so much better at masking / eliminating drone noise.\\\"\\nThe ANC is not the best you can get, but it works really well. Based on his previous complaints, I would guess he doesn't know how to turn the ANC on. I cannot hear my PC next to me, I cannot hear the AC running from where I'm sitting with the ANC turned on. Is the ANC as good as my Sony XM5s? Hell no, but those are the best in the industry. If you're getting these to wear everywhere and block sound, they are not the best, for that. But for just sitting at home playing games, again, it works really well.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, he has no idea what he's talking about. These are some of the best feeling and sounding gaming headsets I've ever bought. Wearing them kind of feels just like the Sony XM4/5s. So if you like how those fit and feel, you will like this headset. You can connect to 2 devices with this at once too using the breakout box and Bluetooth. So you can listen to a podcast/music on your phone and be connected to your PC/PS5 at the same time listening to both. So I would very much recommend this if you can afford it. They are a very good headset and a justifiable upgrade over the previous model.\\n\\nSome other things to address.\\nI saw another complaint about that, Bluetooth not working. It works fine if you connect it correctly and don't walk away too far. But I can walk downstairs and still listen to my phone with this if the phone is upstairs connected with Bluetooth. I have not had any issues dropping the connection. Maybe it's a defect and he should exchange them? I don't know, I don't have that issue.\\n\\nAnother complaint was about having to use the software to adjust the chatmix. You CAN NOT use the software for that. If you try and adjust it with the software it tells you to use the box! See the included screenshot.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I paid a hefty price for these \\\"premium\\\" headphones and the issues I have with this would not even be worth buying if this was only $30. Also, I'm still encountering new issues to update my review on.\\n\\nGood:\\n+Wireless headphones with great range\\n\\n+Double batteries and the station for these headphones has a charger for one while the other is in the headset.\\n\\n+Comfortable fit.\\n\\n+Lots of audio customization in the station alone that doesn't require extra software.\\n\\nHowever, no amount of customizing fixed all these problems:\\n\\n- First off, this is a recent issue I'm adding to this review. I've had these headphones for less than a year, and already one of the ear cushions is tearing apart. I don't think I've owned a headset before that degrades this quickly.\\n\\n-If you use the 2.4G connection, don't use the volume tuner on the station or on the headphones unless you want to hear an obnoxious popping noise soon after doing that. I've spent well over 3 hours looking up many guides and changing the audio settings on the station over and over and this issue never went away. And to top it off, you can't use an external app to change the volume manually because this headset locks the volume at max and ONLY lets you use the headset or station volume control. The only way to get around that is to use something like SteelSeries GG equalizer since the volume control works differently on there. That alone would have deterred me from buying these if I had known about this. But there's plenty more to say.\\n\\n-Bluetooth setting fixed the volume cackling issue but brought up a new one. Some devices had terrible audio regardless of station settings, ALL had background static while nothing was playing (and sometimes still while something was playing), and audio levels jumped by 5 instead of 1 when using the volume tuner on the headset. Once again, after hours of looking up guides and changing settings on the station did nothing to fix this.\\n\\n-Battery charging. Despite being able to swap batteries, it doesn't matter when they randomly decide to not charge for no reason. It happens every (and I do mean EVERY) time I take the battery from the headset out and put it in the charging slot. It won't charge at all. I have to keep messing with the cables and battery before it just decides to work. Both batteries can be affected by it. So, one of the most unique features for this headset, doesn't work correctly. (And I checked to make sure they were inserted to the charge slot correctly and that there weren't any obstructions).\\n\\n-The Equalizer settings on the stations are awful. The built in ones are bad and the custom settings are very bare bones. If you want to use an equalizer, you are better off downloading software.\\n\\n-Active Noise Cancelling option brings many issues that cheaper headphones don't have. The popping problems I mentioned earlier are even worse with this setting on. And setting the sidetone to high on the station settings also causes problems. So that's always fun to have extra stuff to try out only to have annoying problems that make them useless.\\n\\n-Using a wired connection fixes some of these issues, but manages to bring in it's own set of problems. First off, if you use a wired connection directly into the station connected to your pc, the volume gets locked at max and suddenly nothing will lower it. Not the headphones, not the station, not even manually trying to change it on your pc works, the volume level goes all the way to 100 and never moves from there. The only way to change volume is in whatever program you have that has it's own volume options. (So let's say, you are watching a YouTube video and you connect your headphones to your station with a wire. The volume is locked at the highest and the only way to change that is in the YouTube video itself since it has it's own volume slider you can adjust. Trying to use PC settings won't work). Connecting a wire directly to your PC doesn't have any problems, except a very glaring one. Since you aren't connected to the station, none of the settings from there will work on the headset. You can't have both a wired and wireless connection as a workaround. So in other words, the $300 you spent for all these cool features come with annoying issues. The only way to avoid them is to use a wired connection directly into your PC, and none of the bonuses that come with the station are available.\\n\\nIf you want wireless gaming headphones, get something else, these are just awful. If you want Bluetooth headphones, you can get much cheaper ones without possible audio problems for cheaper. If you want regular gaming headphones, you can get much better ones at a cheaper price without all the problems this thing has.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"A little bit of context: I game at the same desk that I work at, and will often transition from my work day into gaming afterwords on my Series X. Before buying these, I used a pair of Arctis 9Xs to listen to music and take calls during the day, then transition to gaming in the evening. I listen to music or sports on my laptop while I practice, and thus really valued the Arctis 9X's ability to blend bluetooth audio from my laptop with gaming audio. However, the 9Xs came with a host of issues that started to drive me insane:\\n\\n* Connectivity issues were awful. My headphones would regularly disconnect even when sitting at the desk, and would occur consistently when getting up and moving around\\n* Turning on the headphones would turn on the xbox every time, so when setting up for work I would need to regularly turn off my Xbox since the headphones had turned it on.\\n* The battery life wasn't long enough to last throughout the work day plus a gaming session\\n\\nNow on to the new headphones: first off, they are ridiculously expensive. I really hope Steelseries finds a way to lower the price-point, especially since the sound isn't a huge upgrade over previous generations. That said, for me, they were worth it, because I use my headphones for everything and all of the issues above are resolved:\\n\\n* Connectivity issues are gone. I get a solid connection even when walking around my (small) house\\n* Bluetooth is separate from xbox and can be powered up individually for non-gaming use\\n* The infinity system makes all-day battery usage a non-issue\\n\\nMy only real criticism of these headphones is the audio quality, which isn't much better than the Artcis 9Xs. It is better, and the noise cancelling is a nice addition, but at the price point I was hoping for something on-par with the Bose QuietComfort series and it isn't there.\\n\\nOtherwise, this is a great set of headphones and I'm glad Steelseries validated my decision to believe in them. These headphones are a clear upgrade over the previous gen and they clearly heard and fixed a majority of the pain points.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"This is a review I will be updating more or less yearly. I am probably the definition of a power user for these headphones because I wear the entire day while I work and game, so like 10+ hours of daily wear for years on end. I dual pair and pick up work and family calls. I walk around the house doing chores while on meetings so range is important, everything is being used here.\\n\\nMy previous pair fell apart after 3 years, what was the culprit? The plastic, the plastic arm that holds the cups literally started giving out, flexing and cracking, letting the headband slip out. These headphones still use plastic in those areas, so we'll see.\\n\\nWhat I like:\\n\\nComfort: Excellent. I have a big ole head and the comfort on the novas is far superior. I can't describe it, the headband on the other ones would make my glasses leave marks behind my ears, real acquired taste, maybe a little masochism. These don't do that. The earpads are super soft and nice, I honestly like them more than the wear earwax trap aero weave or whatever the last ones had.\\n\\nSound: Seriously better. The novas along with the sonar software sound a lot brighter and clear. Apparently these near ear pads do some good work on the lowend, doesn't seem to be lacking. Certainly a step up. The previous version you could feel it maxing out and muddying up pretty badly, specially on the crucial low end parts. They could get a little fatiguing and the EQ feature was a little bizarre and harsh. Not horrible but I wouldn't put them anywhere on a top tier list.\\n\\nUser Experience: Same buttons on the side but they are now in this like, recessed area so you have to fiddle around to find them and any rubbing against the plastic translates to loud a** noise in your ears because of the seal the earpads have, it's meh, minor detail in the grand scheme of things but my hand is on those buttons all day, flipping to bluetooth, chatmix, volume, muting. Steelseries please make them like immediately obvious and protruding again please.\\n\\nMicrophone: Fantastic, a lot more sensitive to distance from the mouth than the previous version. I put it a bit too close and I was clipping like a mad man. Easy to get used to, love the fact that it can be EQd in sonar. Better than previous version I think, we'll see.\\n\\nBuild: They feel robust, similar headband deal going on, more subtle with only a couple of adjustment points.\\n\\nBattery life: I could be biased given my previous set had a lot of use but I did buy many new sets of batteries. The novas seem to be able to about twice as far as the pro wireless battery wise.\\n\\nI still think these headphones are the best pound for pound out there when it comes to all around feature set and quality. There's nothing that comes close. Steelseries contact me if you need feedback from someone that wears these 12 hours a day.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"I decided to shell out for a higher end headset, instead of my typical $100-$200 Logitech or Razer headsets, and I am not disappointed at all.\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY: Good sound, the quality is fantastic, and directional sound is spot on. Playing WWZ with my friends they're usually calling out a special but don't know where it is, and I can pinpoint it almost immediately just from the directional sound. Makes for much more immersive experience for gamers, and music/movies are spectacular as well, and the quality doesn't diminish with volume (for those movies that go from \\\"what did he say?\\\" to my face looks like it has a leaf blower aimed at it).\\n\\nTHE MIC/SOUND CANCELLING: The mic actually picks my voice up, it helps when it's 2 inches or less from my mouth, but even farther than that, people can still hear me. As for sound cancelling, in a word: spectacular. This is the first headset I have owned that when it turns off, my brain immediately goes \\\"What just came on in the house?\\\" from the increase in noise, before I realize that's just the ambient hum of my computer, the A/C, fridge, water heater, and everything else in a house that makes very subtle noise. But it isn't disorienting nor does it muffle voices, I can still hear my girlfriend trying to sneak up on me, or if she calls me from another room clear as day.\\n\\nRANGE: It has decent range, I can go most anywhere in my house and it doesn't have an issue except the kitchen, I have to have the left side facing the computer room from the kitchen, but I blame that on all the metal appliances in that room interfering with the signal. Surprisingly, the microwave running right next to me does not affect it, which means the electronics inside are well shielded.\\n\\nCOMFORT: I have noticed the band that rests on top of my head is very slowly stretching, but it has several notches to adjust it tighter as it does, not a big issue for me. The ear pads are great, never really get that ache or sweat from pressure or lack of air.\\n\\nBATTERY: Usually lasts multiple days between charges while being used 2-6 hours a day. I actually like the fact that the battery is removable, it prevents the need for a cord to be attached to the headset if you forgot to charge it the night before. But if you like to charge it overnight, you can plug the headset in to charge the battery, or swap it into the HUD module and charge it. And it's quick to swap the battery, takes me about 10 seconds in total; most of the time I can do it without my friends even noticing I'm gone during a conversation.\\n\\nOTHER FEATURES: The HUD module can have two computers plugged into the USB C inputs and you can actively switch between the two which I personally found very useful. You can even plug in via 3.5mm jack directly to the headset or to the HUD module; I don't use this, but it's a nice option to have. It's nice to have a reference of sound and headset details (battery level, input, volume) for quick troubleshooting such as if everything suddenly goes silent, I can look at the HUD and see if it's receiving sound or not and that will determine whether it's a headset issue or a computer issue. These are all frivolous additions, but can tip a decision one way or another if your teetering between headsets.\\n\\nAnd if you've read everything up this point, you're actually researching headsets and want to make an informed decision, which I hope this helps in that endeavor. For reference I have a slightly smaller than average head coming in at a 7.25 cap size (22 5/8\\\" circumference), my ears do stick out a good amount (if you're worried about the depth of the ear pieces) and they barely touch the fabric covering the speakers if at all. If you have the dough, I think this headset or their newer versions are worth the investment.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"I've been using the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Gaming Headset since October 1, 2022, and it's been an absolute game-changer in my gaming experience. This headset has not only met but exceeded my expectations in every aspect.\\n\\nThe sound quality is phenomenal. The premium Hi-Fi drivers deliver crisp, clear audio that brings games to life. Whether I'm immersed in an intense FPS battle or exploring vast open-world landscapes, the soundstage is rich and detailed, making the experience incredibly immersive.\\n\\nActive Noise Cancellation is a feature I didn't know I needed until I had it. It effectively blocks out external noise, allowing me to focus entirely on my game without distractions. This feature has been particularly useful during competitive gaming sessions where concentration is key.\\n\\nThe Infinity Power System is ingenious, ensuring I'm never without power. Being able to swap out batteries while the other charges is a huge convenience, eliminating the need for wired play when the battery runs low. This continuous wireless experience is something I greatly appreciate.\\n\\nThe comfort of the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is unparalleled. I've had marathon gaming sessions, and not once have I felt discomfort or the need to take a break due to the headset. The fit is perfect, with just the right amount of clamp force, and the ear cushions are soft and breathable.\\n\\nThe Stealth Retractable Mic is another standout feature. It's crystal clear, ensuring my teammates can hear me without any issues, and I love how it seamlessly retracts into the headset for a sleek look when not in use.\\n\\nCompatibility with multiple systems (PC, PS5/PS4, Switch, Mobile) has been a boon. I frequently switch between devices, and this headset has handled each transition flawlessly. The versatility and ease of connection across platforms have been impressive.\\n\\nDurability-wise, the headset still feels as sturdy and premium as the day I got it. Despite daily use, there are no signs of wear and tear, which speaks volumes about its build quality.\\n\\nIn summary, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Multi-System Gaming Headset has been outstanding in every way. From sound quality to comfort, from battery life to build quality, it ticks all the boxes. I highly recommend it to any gamer looking for a top-tier wireless headset. It's a worthwhile investment for a premium gaming experience.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Recently, I purchased a Victrix BFG Pro. I was skeptical, especially with it lacking vibration. I was borderline not considering it, mostly just because of that. After a few articles showing that Victrix will be adding Hall Effect Sticks in Q1 2024. Price being 40 (USD) for a pair. That's incredible pricing. So awesome upgrade. This matters because I also have a SCUF Instinct Pro Wireless (worst), Razer Wolverine Ultimate (my backup), and my new baby Victrix BFF Pro. Stock, the SCUF comes with no Hard Case. Just the basic swaps for D pad and Sticks. I had to purchase the Hard Case EXTRA, for like 40 or 50, I believe. It came with an additional cord, some additional stick top. And other little stuff. Starting left to right again, The hard case is a nice color grey and the inside is textured and looks great. It's the thinnest of the cases and for one that was paid extra in addition to the most expensive controller of the bunch at 200$ (prices are rough memory estimates). The case for the Victrix is ever so slightly thicker and only noticable if you have them side by side. Both would protect a drop in almost all cases. Inside, the Victrix has a top pocket for the EXTREMELY NICE Purple braided cord (type C to Standard USC). Also has stacked Styrofoam layers of tools and replacement parts, which includes the additional fighting pad that can be swapped with the right joy and button combo pad on the right side of the controller. The next up is the VERY sturdy and thick case. Inside is the pocket up top for the cord and the bottom houses the replacement D pades and sticks (which are held on by high power magnets and is the best setup of the three). With the information given, you'd be understandable in thinking that the SCUF was the worst of the bunch. In price? Sadly, yes. In usability? Hell no. The SCUF is my favorite to use. The reverse button placement is perfect *FOR ME*. Durability wise? Horrible, don't buy, trash, borderline a scam. Not only is SCUF already known for that, it turns out this first of the better QC lot was in fact, crap. Within the first 3 months I had to have it in for a faulty button and faulty bumper. Not a quick process since it's inconvenient to have no controller. Thankfully I'm a nerd lol. Got it back and all was golden. Then after a few months, the same button and bumper started not registering clicks either. Not every time. Just 1/10 I'd say. But you would be shocked how much is messed you up lol. Now, sitting at 14 months with it? Not great at all. 2 buttons. 1 bumper. 1 trigger. All faulty. Never dropped. No liquid anything. Kept literally in a hard case whenever it wasn't in use. I play a few hours a week total so this is minimal use. Terrible product. They will fix it. But I gotta pay for shipping and the full repair. So I'm stuck. Worst 400$ I've ever spent on controller and extras. The Victrix is so awesome. I have medium to medium/large hands lol. Not huge. They are on the CUSP of being too small. Which makes them perfect for me, but it might not be for my bigger brethren out there. I have not noticed the lack of vibration a SINGLE TIME. I even tried to pay attention for it and still didn't notice it. So I guess that's neat lolol. It feels light yet sturdy. It's what you would want for long sessions. Light weight and upgradable/repairable. Victrix doesn't sell replacements of anything yet, that I've noticed. But everything points to Q1 for the start of all that. I've been XBOX my whole life so my brain is struggling with the PlayStation symbols. Sell the XB setup for extra. Just a different single paddle. I'd be so happy. This is my go to by a mile. The Razer Wolverine Ultimate is a wonderful controller. The button placement on the back is TERRIBLE. That's all personal preference so I won't knock it for it. Build is solid. Can't speak for other products of theirs. It's very heavy in comparison. By a chunky margin. But it works great. Feels great. Way cheaper in price but not quality at all. They did a great job with that line. So I'd say\\n\\nSCUF - 6\\nVicxtrix - 9\\nRazer - 7.5/8\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"So I'll start with the best and main feature: The modular face. I can't stress how awesome this thing is for players like me that struggle to find button/dpag/analog setups that work for the way we like to play. For example, I play claw style, so having the 6-button option is a must. Need to go back to play a game where 4-button makes more sense? No problem, just swap the pieces, which is super easy. And those units can be flipped, so for instance, I like the dpad in the top-left most position (by default, that's where the analog stick is, like what you see in the picture), so I simply flipped it. When I'm playing, I also hate having the analog stick in the way, again, no problem, just pops right off (and you get extras).\\n\\nThis modular feature is important because if you play enough, eventually buttons and dpads go out. For a long time, I was using the Hori FC4 (original design), which was a great controller and fairly inexpensive, but the one drawback was that it broke down pretty fast. Pro players that use the dualshock will tell you they replace them every several months, at most. Although I haven't seen it yet, I have to imagine that Victrix will sell the face pieces separately, which will eventually not only give players like me the ability to easily and cheaply replace wornout components, but it opens the door for more designs for those pieces in the future.\\n\\nOtherwise, it has a bunch of other premium features. You can go wired, which for many of us is really important, and the wire is nice and sturdy. Same with the case for the controller and all the various pieces to it. It has a built-in feature to program (or turn off) the back-grip buttons, and multiple profile options, so even though there is an app that allows for more input customization (which is also a rad feature), you don't need that to do some basic input customization. It also has built-in trigger stops, which is amazing, and a tournament mode to disable your system buttons and the touchpad. The pad has a nice, heavy weight to it, too.\\n\\nBefore I got this thing, it was clear it was designed for tournament play in mind. The question I had was whether the dpad(s) would be any good. I use the old, basic, Nintendo cross-style and so far it's working really well. All of the other features, too, are highly-desirable when in a tournament setting, and they function great. But, they went beyond that to ensure that if you want to use it like a normal, casual controller, you clearly can.\\n\\nSo I'll say that at this point it seems the wait was worth it, but I'll end with a caveat: This isn't a casual controller. The price tag should probably tell you that, but I can easily see certain people being disappointed with this thinking it's going to be good for casual use. You really have to be thinking about a competitive setting to see the value you're getting with this pad's features. This controller is comparable in quality to something like the Razer Wolverine v2 but has way better features for competitive play and practice, yet the Wolverine is $70 more. I've used the Victrix for casual gaming already and I can tell you it works great there, too, but unless you're taking advantage of all the features that a non-competitive game *isn't* going to use, then this is probably too expensive.\\n\\nUltimately, a fantastic controller.\\n\\nEDIT: The Victrix Control Hub now works with the BFG, so that eliminates one criticism I had. Now the only thing left for them to address is replacement parts for the modular pieces. This could be make or break though: I've asked them about this and for now even requesting parts directly is not an option. The clock is ticking on that because when everyone starts to have breakdowns, no one is paying for a brand new BFG when a piece that should be really replaceable can't be replaced. That's going to wreck this thing's reputation.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"The Good: This is by far the most responsive, decisive controller I've ever purchased, with excellent remappable buttons for all buttons and triggers, not just the typical 4 buttons, Triangle, Circle, X, and Square PS style, or A, B, X, Y. The 2 triggers used for driving games (Rocket League) can be adjusted to the level of depression as well, which makes dribbling in Rocket League much easier (I play Rocket League Primarily). The joysticks are extremely easy to move, making sharp turns the fastest I've ever been able to accomplish, which is very important in Rocket League to cut off the ball, or turn fast when close to the ball. The included accessories and case are top notch. The dongle for PC eliminates the need for Bluetooth pairing, which is a great plus, as pairing Bluetooth constantly and issues with that is eliminated as well.\\n\\nThe Bad: The thumb grips on the control sticks could use a more rubbery surface to prevent thumb slippage while maneuvering fast, this is a problem with almost all controllers really on the market. Also, the controller is made for small to average sized hands sadly, as that's the biggest issue I have with it. I have very large hands, and the ends of the grips end in the middle of my palms versus a full grip that the Sonicon controller which is much larger than a standard PS4/5 controller that fits my hands superbly. If the PDP Victrix Pro BFG was made at least 1/3rd larger in size, it would accommodate the hands of more people, particularly adults who would be the primary purchaser of such an expensive controller, but well worth it due to the GOOD that I previously mentioned. I'd gladly pay 50 dollars more or even higher for a larger controller exactly like this present one. I hope other companies follow Sonicon's lead in making controllers larger, as smaller controllers with back paddles that can be remapped are out of place for those of us with medium to larger sized hands.\\n\\nOverall: This is easily the best controller I've ever purchased, even with it size issue, I'm learning to place my hands to make it work. Grip extenders do not work sadly, as the shape of the grips being angular rather than round, do not fit and come off shortly after applying. Perhaps they could make a version with the ability to extend the grips by an add on would help solve the problem for large handed individuals, but that wouldn't address the buttons being smaller or the placement of the back paddles which would still be out of place. The real solution would be to make this same controller, just in a larger size for big handed individuals. Till someone does address this issue, like Sonicon did (my previously favorite controller due to its size and responsiveness), I'll have to deal with the current market's limitations on their smaller sized controllers.\\n\\nUpdate: It's JUST TOO SMALL! I cannot adapt to this tiny controller built for children obviously or small adults. Playing Rocket League I'm constantly backflipiping due to the buttons being too close together for my larger than a child's sized thumb. Very frustrating trying to make it work, but in the end, this controller is flat out too small to use effectively for an adult, unless you have puny hands and fingers. The search for an adult sized excellent controller for Rocket League continues sadly. On to the next.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I have used this controller for 130 days. The date of this review is 19 JUN 2023. I received this controller on 10 FEB 2023.\\n\\nThere are serious problems with this controller:\\n\\n1. Stick Drift: The stick drift progressively has gotten worse. At first, I was able to set my right stick dead-zone to 6%. After 60 days it had to be adjusted all the way up to 28%. This is where it's been at ever since. I noticed that even at 28%, when the controller battery gets low, the stick drift will kick in once again and become quite severe to the point the controller is unusable for the remainder of battery life. After turning controller off and back on while recharging, the stick drift tends to stabilize somewhat.\\n\\n2. Audio I/O: There is no built-in microphone so using a headset with microphone is a must- if you want to talk. The battery life is indicated by a small battery indicater with 3 measures. All 3 full means fully charged, 2 means halfway charged, 1 means on low, and blinking means almost drained. If the controller is halfway charged (2 measures) or lower the audio starts cutting out and so does the microphone to the headset. I would actually say all peripheral devices connected to the controller start \\\"acting up\\\".\\n\\n3. Victrix Control Hub App Driver Conflict: Finally, as of June 2023, the \\\"VictrixCompatibility (1).reg\\\" file was released in support of the ongoing \\\"COULD NOT CONNECT \\u2013 Victrix Control Hub App Driver Conflict\\\". So, enthusiastically, I ran the registry update and followed the instructions per PDP's help page. Success, the app finally recognized the controller and the Firmware was being installed- so I thought. Well, the firmware never installed and instead bricked my controller. I followed to the letter all the instructions. I did not disconnect the controller or even minimize the window. After 90mins of staring at my screen and seeing no status bar progress I disconnected the controller as it was obvious something was very wrong. The controller is bricked and does not respond to any button presses. The Victrix app doesn't even recognize the controller as connected. If you value having a working controller, do not use this app. Now, I'm stuck with a $200 Pro BFG paper weight.\\n\\nFor $200 I would not recommend this controller. The stick drift, lack of app support, audio I/O and battery bugs make this controller just completely unreliable. Usually, for this kind of money you would expect to have a top-shelf quality item. I have played everyday for many hours for the past 130 days and I can confidently say it is not a quality item that stands the test of time. It does not stand up to the expectation of stress and performance one would expect from a $200 item. Even the standard PS5 dual sense controllers are cheaper, non-customizable, and drain battery life quicker, yet they do not have these problems.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Controller is S-tier in almost every category of things.\\n\\nI'm going to go over the incredibly short list of cons before I go over the list of pros;\\n- won't turn on your PS5 (you can use your TV remote if you have a TV from this decade).\\n- currently doesn't have an app or software, so you have to change button configurations manually\\n\\nNOW FOR THE LONG LIST OF PROS:\\nThe ergonomics and overall design/engineering is honestly far superior to any other PS5 or even Xbox controller on the market. It is a HIGH QUALITY, WELL-DESIGNED controller meant for LONG SESSIONS or tournament play.\\n- Configuring back buttons and profiles is super easy, so is everything else, I'll add a link on how to use all the features at the end of this review.\\n- The back buttons feel better than any other controller I've ever held, to include the new Razer, the Scufs, the Elite Series 2 (which are my #2 favorite paddles now).\\n- The D-Pads are wonderful, not loud and clicky like razers but have a nice muted feedback to them, I prefer the hybrid d-pad or the Victrix d-pad.\\n- Super easy to swap out thumb sticks and modules and rotate them. Thumbsticks feel great, the longer one is impressive for FPS/TPS.\\n- Triggers are sensitive, require very little actuation force. Super reactive, really a 10/10, trigger stops seem more like they have 3 stopping points than 5, but still super easy to use. Triggers are also textured for grip, but very soft.\\n- The grips on the controller are perfect.\\n- 2 Year warranty as opposed to other companies.\\n- Customer support is better than any of the other companies who I've ordered controllers from.\\n- l1/r1 buttons have a different feel than any other button on the controller, very similar to mouseclicks.\\n- Controller is LIGHT. This will not hurt your hands after a 10 hour play session.\\n\\nEvery single button/stick/interface on this controller is designed with comfort and efficiency in mind.\\nIt is SIGNIFICANTLY better than any other PS5 Pro Controller Alternative. Its ergonomics alone make it better than the Razer Pro (F-tier design, and FFF tier customer support). The Dualsense Edge only has two paddles, and a three hour battery life, which also make it an unworthy comparison. While SCUF's quality is nice, they have a 6-month warranty period, and are SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive. SCUF also modifies the DS5 as opposed to building a god-tier controller from the ground up.\\n\\nI've used this controller on both my PS5 and PC and must say that I've yet to experience a better controller.\\n\\nAnd this review is BEFORE they've even released the software for it. I can't wait to see what that's going to be like!\\n\\nLink to their instructions; https://support.pdp.com/hc/en-us/articles/11045034301325-Victrix-Pro-BFG-Wireless-Controller-for-PS5-PS4-and-PC-User-Guide\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"Pros: The controller is very comfortable, it has great d-pad options & the diamond d-pad itself is the best I ever used; the buttons feel nice on press too. It's great for PC and the Steam app. The case it comes with is very good; I love the fact that you can switch around controller styles & you can make the analog sticks have octagon gates. It was built with many different types of people in mind. I like the fact that this controller was designed & intended for the type of people who don't want to switch between 2 or more different types of controllers to play a variety of games. This controller is very close to perfection in my opinion and Victrix could make the next installment even better if done with even more types of people in mind.\\n\\nCons: Too expensive, no bluetooth, it's very annoying when you have to use the screwdriver everytime you wanna change the style, and you can't remove the 4 back buttons when not in use. Out the box you'll see that the triggers are super sensitive and activates at times you dont want them to because you slightly pressed them. The software isnt helpful when it comes to the triggers; if you wanna play sfv or any 6-button fighting game, you can't make the R1 & R2 into L1 & L2. This is because as of the time of this review, you cant change what the trigger buttons do in the software app; this could be fixed with a simple update. THE MECHANISMS FOR THE TRIGGER LEVELSp ARE THE WORST DESIGN EVER!! It's annoying to change the trigger levels and a pain to set it to the middle level. Everytime I play a game my finger would accidentally touch/slide across the trigger switcher and it cause the trigger to reset to the default trigger position. In the software app I have the triggers set to activate at the very bottom of a press; so when the sensitive trigger mechanism gets touched & resets the triggers to the top position, the game wouldn't recognize my fingers pressing the triggers down unless I switched it back to the bottom position. When this happens while I play online in a fighting game, I have to stop playing and fix the triggers back to the position where the game will recognize it again; and while I'm fixing all this my opponent gets a bunch of free hits on my character. When this happens every time you begin to realize that this controller is unplayable unless you get rid of the trigger lock mechanism. I very much think this controller should have trigger locks but just not this specific one that this controller has built into it. This controller is too expensive for its flaws.\\n\\nOpinion:\\nThis is a cool controller, the case along with the other accessories you get inside the box are all useful and it gives you alot to test with. The diamond d-pad is my favorite part about this controller, it just feels great when playing online in fighting games. I definitely want Victrix to make more fightpads in the future, but the software app customization should be more like 8bitdo and the trigger lock switches should be like the xbox elite controller. It's too expensive for the amount of flaws and frustration it causes. I thought this controller would be the fightpad to make me feel like I could stop searching for a perfect controller to use for fighting games, but that's not the case here. I did see a few youtuber reviews who also agree that this controller isn't worth the high price and that there are too many flaws. There are also tons of youtubers praising this controller and I just wanted to share my experience. I honestly think Victrix can improve on these flaws and make an even better controller in the future; I do like the options it offers but not the execution. For the current price you can probably find more affordable & less stressful options. In my attached review photo; the red controller next to the Victrix pro bfg is an Aliexpress controller that I got in June 2022 for $25-30. It has a great d-pad, the button presses are responsive and works with whatever fighting game you like; I highly recommend it, just search fightpad on Aliexpress and you should see it. At most this is not a bad controller it's just too expensive, if this controller was $100 or less and had the same issues, I probably wouldn't have written so much in this review tbh. If you don't wanna spend almost $200 for a fightpad, then I'm sure you can find cheaper alternatives.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Controllers are overpriced period. $200 is not worth having a few extra buttons and a trigger stop. With that said I do need the back paddles and this controller has those. Nice and light and has held up perfectly for the past 12 months without any drift or issues. I have it 5 stars but with I can turn on the system with the controller, you have to turn on the PS5 before using this. For less than $200, this is a great option. $150 would be a good price point though.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I have never used a scuf before and was pretty happy that it only took a couple minutes to get used to the paddles on the back. I still accidentally press them every once in a while but I chalk it up to a skill issue. I really like that everything can be remapped how you want it through the app. FYI you have to have access to Windows in order to update the controller and use wirelessly with the PS5. Overall definitely recommend this as oppose to the DualSense Edge, and its cheaper too!!\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"First off, if you play fighting games on pad, the Victrix is the best PS5 option currently. The Hori Octa Fighting Commander is fine in every way except for where it counts most - the D-Pad. It's way too small.\\n\\nThe Victrix BFG here, has a WAY better D-Pad that is also customizable per ones taste. The fight button module is rather clicky, as it should be. The extra back triggers/paddles can be a bit too easy to accidentally hit, or at least the lower 2 are - so I disabled them in the software. The software itself is kinda finicky, but I set it up once and never had an issue again.\\n\\nFor reference, I play Guilty Gear Strive, and so far I have made considerably less input errors on this pad compared to the Hori. 623 inputs always come out, although half circle inputs for supers can be finicky if I do them too fast (might be a me problem. I bound the back paddles to RC and dash Macros, and so far I haven't had any issues with hitting the wrong triggers.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this to people who want a dedicated PS5 pad, although the price by itself can be hard to overcome if you just set it up for Fighting games and never swap modules like I do. This, I must give it 4 stars.\",\n",

PC will give you Xbox (A,B,X,Y) output on your screen.\\n\\nCons: Back buttons don't feel comfortable while playing. I find myself pushing them unnecessarily.

            "        \"1\": \"Quick background, skip if uninterested: I\\u2019m absolutely not an audiophile so this review doesn\\u2019t come from a place of incredible pickiness. My old (and cheap) headset broke in the middle of playing online with friends. I was very upset and rushed to Best Buy that evening in an attempt to quickly replace it. Needless to say I was tempted into buying something else(a different \\u201cgamer headset\\u201d brand) and hated it a lot. After fighting with that horrible setup for a few hours, I decided to order the Arctis 7+ here.\\n\\nStart of review for the particular 7+ model I bought off here:\\nDELIVERY- I ordered it and it arrived wayyy earlier than I expected. I was so excited to try it out. So far I\\u2019ve used them them for about 2-3 months.\\nCOMFORTABLE- I can say they\\u2019re very very comfortable. Even after some 10 hour play sessions, I almost forget they\\u2019re there and bump them. The pads around the ears are a perfectly soft material. They\\u2019re a soft fabric material that does not break down like I\\u2019ve noticed the smooth fake leather to. These also don\\u2019t get too hot around my ears thanks to the breathable padding material.\\nI have long hair and OTHER headphones tend to grab and pull out my hair a lot- I haven\\u2019t had that issue with this set except a couple times where the fault was all on me because I pulled a joint area through my hair. Otherwise, it seems it\\u2019s really hard for this to happen on accident like my other sets always did (Owwy!)\\nUnlike most other headphones, this set has an elastic- yet soft- band under the headband that pretty much suspends the headphones over your head rather than resting their weight directly on the top of your scalp. I find that this design choice really improves the comfort for me, as with other headphone sets the weight and rigidity of the headband start to hurt over time. The Bluetooth feature on this also allows me to sit back, play from a couch, or go get a drink (important!) while still talking to my friends.\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY- I once again want to remind that I am no audiophile. After getting these and starting some gameplay, I immediately noticed highs and lows I wasn\\u2019t hearing from my old headsets. Little environmental sounds, instruments in soundtracks I never noticed or heard before, subtle feedback sounds from button presses and menus, I recall calling them out to my friends and them being equally surprised I now noticed them.\\nOne of my personal gripes with modern headphones lately is that every company wants to make super bassy sounding headphones, as the average person associates quality with bass for some reason. Out of the box, all of the sound levels for these are perfect in my opinion, not too bassy or anything. If you wanted bassy headphones out of this though, you could easily just go in and change that using the steel series sound control app. I haven\\u2019t changed anything myself because I like how they sound as is.\\nAnother thing I wanted was independent volume control for the headphones, which this has! Not only can you control the volume with a dial on the headset but you can also adjust wether you want chat or game sounds to be louder than the other on the headset. I was also concerned that audio quality may differ between wired or wireless connection, but everything seems fine regardless of connection type. Mic quality is decent for hanging out and talking to friends. We never have static issues, it never catches annoying background noise, no chirps, so far I\\u2019ve heard no issue myself. The mic quality probably isn\\u2019t something you\\u2019d use for high quality production, like making videos, podcasts, or streaming. Though you probably could do any of those things if you\\u2019re not a stickler for recording quality. I feel it\\u2019s mainly a headset for comfortably gaming- a role it\\u2019s more than fulfilled for me!\\n\\nNOISE CANCELLATION- I\\u2019m personally indifferent to wether my headsets have noise cancellation or not. I don\\u2019t live in a particularly loud place, so I don\\u2019t get to test this one out much. Every once in a while another family member may approach me to ask something, and I can hear them at that point, but not if they call from another room. The outer side of the mic has a small mic that picks up sound outside your headset and feeds it back to you with a subtle and quiet delay. I\\u2019m not used to that myself but it does come in handy here and there. It does sometimes also trick me into thinking the headset mic is picking up and putting outside noise into my calls (it\\u2019s not though, confirmed by friends). I\\u2019m indifferent to this feature, as it hasn\\u2019t caused me too much issue and I\\u2019m pretty sure it can be turned off.\\n\\nOTHER FEATURES- The mic is posable and retracts, it\\u2019s a pretty nice way to store the headset or just get the mic out of your peripheral vision until in use.\\nThere\\u2019s a small button on the left side that mutes the mic, when muted the mic lights red, which is a pretty handy visual reminder as in the past I have often found myself talking for minutes on end to myself while in calls with friends (lol).\\nThe headset comes with some other wired connection options, even a headphone Jack option.\\nTo connect to your computer it DOES use a wired dongle, so if you are trying to save on USB port space, be aware it does take one.\\nI\\u2019m not sure how to measure this, the Bluetooth connectivity works throughout my whole room and even in the rooms immediately over. I am usually able to go to my kitchen and prepare myself food or drinks while still enjoying music or talking, so long as the battery has a decent charge.\\nThe battery life is REALLY good. I personally have always made it a habit to charge anything when I\\u2019m not using it, so I never see it die. BUT to vouch for its lifetime- one time I didn\\u2019t realize the USB end of my cord wasn\\u2019t plugged into my computer until after a week of thinking I had been charging it nightly after game sessions and daily use. This thing lasted a whole week of /at least/ 6-8 hour use daily with absolutely no charging that whole time before I just happened to pull on the usb for it and find it had never been plugged back in that whole week. So for sure with this headset, unless you\\u2019re playing insanely all the time with the highest volume in use, you\\u2019ll never see it die so long as you check it in for a charge here and there!\\n\\nEnd summary: Overall I can say I\\u2019m very happy with this headset. Definitely has become my favorite one. I would strongly recommend it to anyone that wants a headset suited best for comfortable gaming and chatting. I was skeptical of Bluetooth functionality before buying, but it has WELL PAST won me over.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"This is perhaps the only headset I've had where my hair doesn't constantly get stuck. The cuffs are nice and soft, and the light weight of the headset lead to my usually 2-3 hour stream to be nearly 6 hours without noticing the time. Could have probably gone longer too. The battery life lasts me a good few days w/o needing to be charged every day. The quality of the sound is nice too with the only downside being no noise canceling, but I like to be able to hear my environment in case of emergencies and knowing what will and will not be picked up by my mic. It does take a bit to get the split audio sorted, so patience is a must especially if you are not familiar with it. I found it easy enough if you are familiar with headset software.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"The headset fits really nice, it's light and VERY comfortable, you barely feel it after a long while of using them. Sound quality is really good, for music and gaming is amazing. I've tried it with Gears 5 and DMC 5 and it's simply amazing. Easy to use after you quickly check the manual, can use the transmitter with the PC and the Bluetooth with the phone simultaneously, and that's cool.\\nThe bad: The software. Download ONLY the Engine application, NEVER ACTIVATE THE SONAR APP, it's supposed to be for spatial sound, but not only doesn't sound that good, it'll override your sound system and make a mess to use your PC without the headphones, could only fix after uninstalling, so beware.\\nBTW: The heatset sounds amazing with Dolby Atmos and cool with DTS (but the voices can get kinda muddy with DTS).\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I really like how it can connect to Bluetooth and through the wireless dongle concurrently. I've had Bluetooth earbuds that advertise multipoint connections, but those ones just swap between devices when it detects audio rather than allow you to hear both simultaneously.\\n\\nI dislike how tight these feel around my head. My previous headphones were very comfortable; I could wear them all day. These ones make my head feel constricted and my ears hot. You can adjust the height of the headphones but not how tight it wraps around your head as far as I can tell. Another negative is that it slips around my head when I tilt it forward or backwards.\\n\\nThe microphone is decent out of the box; crystal clear but a tad on the soft side and not very authentic sounding. The audio is also plenty good out of the box. I'd say the sonar software isn't required to be pleased with the product. I personally haven't downloaded it, but I'm sure it would allow for a greater set of customization and improve the sound and microphone experience.\\n\\nThere is also some side tone when your mic is on, whether you are in a call or not, that amplifies the sound of your surroundings. You can mute your mic to stop this.\\n\\nMy final observation I will mention is in regards to the battery indicator. It's not very specific. The indicator stays green between the wide range of 50% to 100%. Even while charging you can't really tell if it's close to being fully charged. I can confirm though that the charging indicator will turn off by itself when the battery is at 100%.\\n\\nUpdate: After spending more time using these headphones, I have a few new observations to add to my review.\\n\\nI noticed sound leaks through the foam earcup cushions. If there's anyone around you and the sound is at or above a medium volume, it can be heard. Likewise, the microphone can pick up sound from the drivers above a certain threshold.\\n\\nThe headphones have been stretched to fit my head better. I can wear it for longer periods of time now without feeling like my head is going to explode, though I stick to my original sentiment of it not being the most comfortable.\\n\\nFinally, I will also mention the audio has gotten glitchy on me a couple of times. The first time this happened I just did a quick reset to fix it. The second time I just waited, and after roughly 5 - 10 seconds it fixed itself. I'm assuming the connection momentarily became weak. I'm not sure why as I was sitting right next to the dongle both times.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I finally know how to use my headset. It took some trial and error, mostly because I've never used a wireless headset with some of these features, and never this brand. I hope the information helps you.\\n\\nNow that I've gotten everything figured out, I am having a great experience with this headset. Here are the things I've learned:\\n\\nLeft earcup: The rearmost button mutes the mic. If you have the boom extended, the mic will have a glowing red (and annoying) stripe. There is probably a way to turn that off, but as far as I can tell, the mic works perfectly well fully retracted. So when that button is raised, the mic is muted. When it's pressed in, it's live. I like that tactile system better.\\n\\nVolume knob: Slide it to the rear to increase, to the front to decrease. I recommend staring in the lower 1/2 of the dial the first time you use these.\\n\\nPorts and stuff: I'll let the manual handle these. Reminder, you can use the headset wired using the USB cable that comes with the headset (or I guess any USB cable that has USB-C on at least 1 end).\\n\\nRight earcup: This is where I had trouble figuring things out. The knob is the chatmix knob, which should let you adjust the strength of your media volume against the strength of the volume in whatever chat app you're using. To the rear for media, to the front for chat. I had the wheel halfway between the halfway mark and the front, and all the volume for the media I was streaming was super quiet. I thought maybe the headset had a volume limiter, but per support, it does not. Instead of trying all the 'pull off the foam and reset/ reinstall everything' that was already a fresh install, almost by accident I found out that if you have the knob halfway (has a nice little click or bump when you hit the middle), the volume is fine. I currently have mine halfway between the halfway mark and all the way back. If I need to adjust it, I know how now.\\n\\nSide Tone: This is a software feature. It lets you hear what your mic is picking up. HEAVEN FORBID you accidentally rub your arm or your sleeve over the mics while this feature is on. It nearly scared the life out of me until I figured out how to turn that off. It's in the software.\\n\\nThat's about it, I'm having fun playing with the EQ in Sonar to get the sound exactly as I like it, and the headset is as nice and loud as I'd like it to be. Definitely glad I made this purchase, upgrading to a wireless headset has been life-changing already.\\n\\nOH! And the range. I have a 1 br apartment, 1 bath, kitchen, living area, dining area. If you think of the living area as the front right quadrant, bedroom rear left, bathroom rear right and dining room front left: I was able to travel to every far corner of the apartment with no problem. I am not taking this outside while the dongle is on my PC, so it has all the range I need. People with large ranch or multi-level homes, your experience may vary, but it's certainly not as bad as some reviews made it sound.\\n\\nAlso the headband and ear cups are every bit as comfortable as nearly every says they are.\\n\\nEnjoy!\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"Kicking myself for not going wireless sooner!\\n\\nMy only real complaint would be the lack of noise cancelling, so hoping this could be added to the software in the future for headsets that do not have this feature in hardware.\\n\\nVery comfortable and adjustable. High build quality. I also enjoy the ability to also pair with a Bluetooth device (e.g. phone) and still listen to PC audio.\\n\\nCharging is quick and lasts for days of regular use.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Use wise they work great and sound great. Charge wise they seem to last forever between charges. My only complaint is they tend to run a bit small or tight but that might be because I have a bigger head (hat size 7-3/4). Volume could get a little louder but I'm old and don't hear so good. I don't really use all the bells and whistles but they have them if you're into that kind of thing. I use them for online gaming with my son and they are great for that. PS if the charge dies you can get 6-8 hours out of a 10 to 15 minute charge...\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"3.5 stars.\\nPros:\\n3rd most comfortable headphones I've worn.\\nDecent range - I can go downstairs to the kitchen or down 2 flights to the front door without losing connection.\\nEasy to setup\\nRed light on the mike so I *know* whether or not I'm muted\\nMike does good noise-cancelling (headphones don't do active NC)\\nOK sound quality.\\n\\nDisappointments:\\nI bought an Arctis 7 five years ago and used it daily since then, mostly for work video conferencing. However, I started having some problems with the mic cutting in and out and then one of the earpads fell off so I figured I'd finally replace it. I went looking for the same ski-goggle-strap style headband because it's the most comfortable of any headphones that my partner or I have tried. Sadly, no one else seems to have picked up the same style and SteelSeries is getting rid of it in favor of a less-adjustable option for their Nova.\\n\\nAfter trying a logitech option and being disappointed, I decided I'd just go with the same thing I bought last time rather than trying to find something new. I thought the 7+ would be basically the same, but it's not. The first one I got kept randomly shutting off. Whatever, some devices are duds and Amazon exchanged it easily for me. But this new one is still worse than the original 7. It's less comfortable, although that might be more about breaking it in. But the mute button only occasionally works. I have to stick my fingernail in it to get it to pop open. Sometimes it'll seem like it popped open, but the red light doesn't switch so I know I'm not muted.\\n\\nThen there's the software. I installed the software and updated the headphones firmware, and it was basically fine. I tried the new Sonar tools and adjusted the sounds so they sounded good. I really liked that I could adjust the mike to fit my higher-pitched voice. Very cool. Only, when I select the \\\"sonar\\\" options in my audio list, the headphones just don't work. No sound comes through at all. Fortunately, there's still a generic option for the \\\"arctis 7+\\\" and I've been using that instead. The headphones beep when they turn on/off. The old ones did too, but this beep is higher pitched and much more annoying.\\n\\nI'd probably return them if I were inside the return window because that's a lot of caveats for the money. But they're good in a lot of ways and I'm biased by the comparison with the earlier Arctis 7, which were the best headphones I've ever owned.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"So I've had the Arctis 7 headset for years and it never really fit well (I put up with it because the sound quality was SO much better than other brands) so I was a bit skeptical about buying the Nova 7 headset.... All of that went away the second I put the Nova headset on. It's lightweight, fully adjustable, and the sound quality improved over the Arctis 7 line. I've already had profiles set up in GG so switching over to the Nova from the old Arctis was easy, I didn't even have to mess with any of my old profiles, the Nova just made everything sound so much better. I marked the noise canceling lower because it's not true noise canceling, if you have it at a lower volume, sound does bleed through. But the audio quality of the drivers is so good that unless you have a rave going off next to you, you won't hear a thing other than what's playing through the headset. I've been in music production and mixing for the past decade and the Nova is better than my studio headphones. As soon as I got them, I loaded up some of my favorite bass-heavy music and blasted it through the headset. Steelseries might as well advertise these as haptic because the bass gets them moving. My friends in Discord say the mic quality is good, which I also have filtered through GG. Overall, I couldn't be happier.\\n\\nIf you're considering getting this headset and don't mind running Steelseries GG to tweak your sound profiles, definitely get it.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"I got into the habit of writing my reviews after a few weeks/months, as the joy of unpacking and trying the new product out for the first time is often so great that you subconsciously tend to ignore minor flaws. Once you have used what you have bought for several weeks, you can certainly give other buyers much more useful tips than at first. After about 4 months with the Arctis Nova 7 Wireless Headset I can say that it excels compared to the competition in the same price-range.\\nThe set has a soft, elastic band under the headband which means that it suspends the headphones over your head rather than resting its weight directly on the top of your scalp which means that it's EXTREMELY comfortable and the set never started to hurt over time. Sound quality is excellent for this price range BUT it needs tweaking. Luckily, the SteelSeries GG Sonar app is easy to use and does an good job in this regard. Noise cancellation is OK-ish. Functional but a bit below the expected standard at times. The mic also needs some tweaking but it's perfectly fine once tuned.\\nThe Bluetooth functionality is the absolute highlight of the set. Really effective, it never let me down. My only complaint is the build materials. The plastic (the set has no metal parts!) is fragile. For the price, I would have expected some sturdier materials. So buy a case or a stand for it, it's a must.\\nOverall, I\\u2019m very happy with this headset. I would strongly recommend it to anyone that wants a headset for comfortable long sessions of gaming and chatting with flawless Bluetooth functionality.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"I\\u2019ve gone through exactly 3 headsets (The official Microsoft Xbox One headset, PlayStation Gold Wireless headset 2018, and a Razor headset) looking for a viable option that had both DECENT audio and mic quality, as all the headsets I\\u2019ve purchased have had build quality issues and terrible mic quality. I\\u2019ve given up on picking up a wireless headset as from what I\\u2019ve seen, are incredibly expensive. I saw the ad for the SteelSeries Arctic 1 headset and it seemed too good to be true (very cheap price for a wireless headset, and interchange between 3 consoles) and to my surprise, it lived up to pretty much all its claims.\\n\\nWireless connectivity works seamlessly with its included dongle, and I have had zero dropouts or latency issues with it on both PS4 and Nintendo Switch. I originally purchased this headset primarily for the PS4, as I imagined wireless headsets were completely incompatible with the Nintendo Switch, but the headset does in-fact work effortlessly and all the buttons on the headset (Mic Mute On/Off, Volume Dial) work on both systems. Mic quality is excellent as well as audio quality, it\\u2019s perfectly balanced and not ridiculously skewed towards bass, and the volume can be raised very high on both consoles if you want. Battery life so far has also been great, it\\u2019s something I haven\\u2019t had to worry about when using and I only had to charge them once every week out of habit. The headset itself doesn\\u2019t feel flimsy and seems decently built, It\\u2019s pretty light and is surprisingly comfortable to wear, so much I use it also when I\\u2019m on my laptop. The only thing that slightly annoys me is that when I switch playing consoles and want to use the headset on it, I have to get up and unplug the headset dongle and connect it to the console I\\u2019m using (say, from the PS4 to the Nintendo Switch). This is pretty much a first world problem, but it\\u2019s something I\\u2019ve come across every once in a while.\\n\\nOverall I have to say I\\u2019m really loving this headset, if you were on the fence for this thing I really recommend you give it a try.\\n\\nUPDATE June 2020: It\\u2019s been 8 months since I\\u2019ve bought this headset, and I just wanted to report back that it has held up ROCK SOLID. This thing is by all means not flimsy, and the battery life has held up incredibly well. I\\u2019ve been gaming really long sessions, roughly 5-6 hours long each with friends online, and this thing just keeps going with no issues whatsoever. One of the few purchases I\\u2019ve made that I can say was absolutely worth it.\\n\\nFINAL UPDATE April 2021: Managed to get myself a PS5 and happy to say the headset works flawlessly with it. The new thing I love about the headset now is that the PS5 has a USB-C port in the front, which means you don\\u2019t have to use the included cable that comes with the headset dongle for USB-A, you can plug it directly to the PS5 and it sits flush and is almost unnoticeable.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"As an average gamer, non-audiophile, and PC user, I bought and used a pair of Astro A20s as my first wireless headset and I regret it deeply. The mic was really sensitive; any sort of breath, head movement, adjusting of the headset, background noise, etc would come through. Not only that, but I would also hear static and crackling noises occasionally. Also, if I would move my head at all, the headset would creak. Very annoying. On multiple occasions, I would find that when I turned on my PC, the dongle would disconnect and require a cycle of pressing the button and restarting the computer until it would connect again. Resorted to permanently leaving my PC on because of this. The directional sound was also non-existent...false advertising.\\nI DON'T HAVE ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS WITH THIS NEW HEADSET!!!\\nThe sound is amazing; I can hear sounds from all directions and there is no crackling/static. The ear pads are very comfortable; I game on my PC for at least 10 hours per day, and I have yet to experience any soreness or fatigue. Noise cancelling on the mic is excellent. The range is pretty good; I can walk from my room to the downstairs kitchen without the headset disconnecting. The headset is also rhythm game-friendly, as the audio does not lag or desync at all--a problem I experienced with the A20. Battery life seems to be accurate. My only gripe is that I have to download the SteelSeries software to customize the audio, which requires creating an account and giving out my email address.\\nOverall, if you are not an audiophile and want a good wireless headset for a budget-friendly price, I highly recommend the Arctis 1. I'm sure any other SteelSeries model is great; my sister has the Arctis 7 and loves it. I settled with this one because it was the cheapest I could find (and less expensive than the A20).\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Okay let me start off and say that this headset is TREMENDOUSLY GOOD. I been using Astros for years and i kinda got burnt out on it & i wanted to try something new and then i came across Steelseries Arctis 1 Wireless. I\\u2019ve heard about Steelseries for quite sometime but never really bothered getting a headset until now.\\n\\nComfort 10/10 : Let me honestly say that this is the most comfortable headset i have ever wore in my entire life. I\\u2019ve been through Astro A40s, Astro A50s, Turtle Beach ( I don\\u2019t recommend btw ) , Somy headsets and this took me by surprise. For a $100!? It\\u2019s honestly amazing. The clamping force is really not bad. Doesn\\u2019t hurt your ears or anything when putting them on. Also the very soft leather material they use on the Ear Cups is the best i have felt.\\n\\nDurability 10/10 : Now you may think it looks like a very cheap plastic. I\\u2019m gonna let you know that it\\u2019s not. They use a very strong plastic & what makes this even better is the very strong reinforced steel they use on the headband which makes it very durable and flexible. This doesn\\u2019t mean you can just throw your headset because it\\u2019s that durable. As every other gaming headset just take them off gently and place them down gently to avoid any damage. Overall you don\\u2019t have to worry about this breaking on you unlike that cheap plastic that Turtle Beach use. If i can compare to another headset in terms of durability it would be Astros. It\\u2019s that good.\\n\\nSound 10/10 : Boy oh Boy let me just say. When i first hooked these up i was SHOCKINGLY stunned how loud these were. It was to the point i legit had to turn them down a notch because it was that loud. You definitely get your bass, Low, Mids & Highs. You have very good directional sounds so you can hear enemy footsteps from behind, front, ledt & right perfectly well and you can also tell weather they\\u2019re up top or at the bottom. Overall the Sound Quality is top tier so don\\u2019t listen to the reviews of ppl saying it\\u2019s bad\\n\\nNoise Cancellation 10/10 : Steelseries definitely nailed it on this one. When you put this on you cam barely hear anything in the background. There was times i had to take these off to actually hear what they\\u2019re saying. Probably one of the best i seen if you ask me.\\n\\nMic Monitoring 10/10 : Now let me get this straight. Ppl said the mic was terrible but they\\u2019re wrong . Let me tell you that this Mic sounds very crisp and clear. As far as i stated before with the noise cancellation ppl can barely hear anything in your background with this mic. So if you got a PS4 that sounds like an AC130 taking off this will cover it 100% and i also love the fact it\\u2019s w Clearcast mic which is why it\\u2019s even better. You can also use the Steelseries EQ Engine to adjust any of these features above to your liking weather you wanna tweak the sounds or the mic etc so that\\u2019s a W for Steelseries.\\n\\nOverall Review : These are definitely worth $100. I recommend anyone to get this if you\\u2019re struggling to get a good headset especially the more expensive premium ones. Although this headset does feel very premium if you ask me. You won\\u2019t be disappointed with this product at all. By far my new favorite headset along with Astros.\",\n",

After 4-6 hours, there's no discomfort. Lots of room in the ear cups with a good amount of padding.\\nI use mine for gaming on the ps5. The battery life seems to be close enough to what they advertise. First time use was as simple as plugging the included dongle into the front of the ps5 and turning on the headphones. The sound quality is good and very well balanced. It's loud enough that I normally turn it down to around 60-70% volume. Didn't distort at max volume as well. It comes with 3 cables: A micro usb, usb-c to usb extension for the included dongle, and a 3.5 mm audio cable for headphone jacks.\\nCons:\\n-The micro usb charging port is very inconvenient and outdated.\\n-The ear cups are fabric and will be harder to clean.\\n-To turn the headphones on and off require you to press and hold the power button for several seconds each time. A simple switch would have been better.\\n-The overall style and design is kinda dull and nothing to write home about.\\nOverall, I'm satisfied with these headphones. If you want a no nonsense pair of headphones that are reliable and get the job done, these are worth considering.\",\n",

            "        \"6\": \"I usually dont bother writing reviews, but this headset is so perfect that i just had to. I cant believe how well they fit, how comfortable they are right out of the box, and how amazing they sound. The crispness of the audio is evident right away. I have gone through many headsets. I had the X41 Turtle beaches, the stealth 600 gen 1 and gen 2 as well as other foreign gaming headsets that were supposedly great, and these blow all of them away in every category. They look great, the head band part is flexible so it wont break, the comfort is 10 our of 10, and most importantly the sound is so clear and you can always tell exactly what direction an enemy is coming from in shooter games. Another thing that i love about this headset is the wireless dongle they use. Instead of a USB, its a dongle that fits the Playstation, my computer, my laptop, and my Android phone. It just works the way its supposed to on every device. Also, the microphone is detachable too so you dont need to have it on all the time if you dont want to. They thought of everything with these headsets. And the battery lasts a long time as well. I will never buy another type of wireless gaming headset other than this. I believe it will last for years to come but that remains to be seen. You cant go wrong with these. 10 out of 10 overall from me.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Disclaimer: While I am a big headphones enthusiasts (have tried/owned many different pairs), this only my second gaming headset, as I have usually played video games through speakers. I previously had a cheap Turtle Beach set that I used for PS4 multiplayer games with friends and family. Since building a new gaming PC 4 months ago, I've been using headphones for gaming more often. I've also had to use headphones for work since my job has moved to WFH for the foreseeable future. My favorite cans are currently my modded Koss Pro DJ100 w/ a good amp (closed set) and the Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro (open set) which I also use for mixing/editing audio tracks. I bought these because I needed a wireless set for couch gaming when I run my PC into my TV.\\n\\nComfort & Looks: Arctis 1 = 4/5; Arctis 7 = 4.5/5\\nThe plastic finish and plain look are OK but not amazing. For $100 dollars the look and feel is totally serviceable. There are some rough-ish edges on the headband, but everything else is smooth. The clamping force is a little tight for me personally, but it's comfortable otherwise (not too hot, headband rests OK, can move around just fine, etc). My partner has a smaller head than me and they love the Arctis 1 so far with no complaints (it is now their main headphone for working and gaming). The Arctis 7 is excellent for me and the headband is very comfy. The clamping pressure is less but still allows for movement without falling off my head. I like the slightly cleaner look & feel of the 7, but the 1 is sturdy in its own right (if just a little rough).\\n\\nSound: Arctis 1 = 4/5; Arctis 7 = 4.5/5\\nThe sound on the Arctis 1 is quite good for a $100 wireless set (although not an audiophile set exactly). Definitely a mainstream gaming EQ curve (extra bass, slightly scooped mid). The details are fine and the soundstage works well with stereo effects in music or games (like enemies clunking around in FPS games). There's OK high extension but they're slightly attenuated. Mids are generally accurate but there seems to be more prominent low and high mids honestly. After EQing in the provided software I was able to quickly set up a couple profiles (gaming and music) that sounded good to me for general gaming and listening. The Arctis 7 isn't incredibly different although I feel it's a little more balanced and has better isolation. The soundstage also feels a little more realistic to me personally and it feels just a little more detailed. The surround sound is OK, but I'm honestly fine with stereo imaging.\\n\\nMic/Communication Functions: Arctis 1 = 3.5/5;Arctis 7 4/5\\nThe mic is decent (same microphone on both), but it has that constant compression and low dynamic range thing going on. It's perfectly serviceable for communicating in games (and work meetings, Zoom calls, etc.), but don't try to record vocals with it or anything like that. I've been using it to teach and my students say it sounds fine compared to my usual SM58 or AT2020 setup.I should note that the Arctis 7 has game chat mix in case you want to mix the level of chat mixed into your game. It's a nice feature if you play games where chat is useful. I also love that the mic on the Arctis 7 can be pushed back up into the ear cup.\\n\\nConnectivity & Battery: Arctis 1 =4.5/5; Arctis 7 = 3.5/5\\nGreat connectivity options on the Arctis 1, especially the USB-C dongle. So easy to switch between devices (including my phone) on the fly. The Arctis 7 has a traditional USB dongle with line in/line out 1/8' jacks. It's fine but less useful than the Arctis 1 dongle for me. The battery life is great on both and they charge back up pretty quickly as well.\\n\\nTLDR: Arctis 1 has higher clamping force, better overall connectivity, and it's rougher around the edges. The Arctis 7 is comfy, better built, and has better isolation and a tuck-away mic. I think the Arctis 7 sounds just slightly better, but they're both nice wireless headphones in their own right. If you have a small to average head and want to save $50, the Arctis 1 is great. If you want more polish, have a larger head, or want slightly better communications functionality, grab the Arctis 7.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I have been using this headset for a little over a week and would like to share my experience so far.\\n\\nPros:\\n-The sound quality is great\\n-The over ear design is comfortable\\n-The 'on headset' controls are very useful (volume control, mute/unmute microphone toggle)\\n-The microphone voice clarity is great\\n-I love that the microphone can be taken off when not in use so its not always in the way\\n-The 2.4ghz dongle is USB-C but the headset does come with a USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter. So i can use it with anything.\\n-The wireless range is great\\n-Zero audio latency is amazing\\n-Long battery life\\n-Works on all of my devices (most importantly my xbox since there are ZERO wireless headsets for xbox one for some reason)\\n\\nNow, with all of those great things about it that i have never seen another headset match, there are a few things about this headset that i found to be surprising problems in a headset that is so highly rated, loved, and priced.\\nAnd i do understand that some of the issues that i have with it are going to be very specific to me, and few people that struggle with the same unique traits that i do.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Low build quality in something that has a premium price.\\nWhen i pay $100 for a headset i expect it to be top of the line in the materials used to make it. But instead it is made out of very cheap feeling plastic that is very easy to break/bend. This makes the headset feel extremely ridged and like you constantly have to be careful with it. And i dont like having to worry about that when paying so much for it. When i pay a premium price, i should feel like i am holding a premium item.\\n-HEADACHES.\\nThis is one will will probably be pretty specific to me because i am VERY prone to headaches. But to put it plainly, the headset is so NON ADJUSTABLE that it squeezes my head VERY TIGHT in just the wrong way to cause me to get a lot of tension headaches. Not what i want in a headset that i intend to be wearing for 6+ hours a day. I have tried to pull on the headband portion to make it sit a little wider on my head in an effort to make it so its not squeezing my head so tightly but thats another situation where the poor build quality comes into play. When i try to pull on it the shell is so ridged that it cant change shape at all. it just starts to bend in a way that makes the cushion on top of your head pop out and starts to look like your about to do some permanent damage to the headset. So i am forced to deal with the headset squeezing my head a lot tighter than i would prefer.\\n-Its very heavy.\\nIve used a lot of different headsets in my life and im sure its partly because of the added weight from the battery.\\nBut regardless of that when i have the headset on, i feel like my head is significantly weighed down. Even when compared to other wireless headsets ive used. This also doesnt positively effect my headaches.\\n-I have to hold the power button for a frustratingly long time to either turn it on or off but most importantly to wake it up when it puts itself into sleep mode.\\nSomething as simple as a toggle switch instead of a press and hold button would completely fix this issue. Not sure whether its just straight up turning itself off when inactive for a few min or if its goes into some kind of sleep mode, either way it is surprising how much it bothers me to do things like leave my desk for 5 min and have to hold the power button down for 5+ seconds before i can hear anything again. This wouldnt annoy me as much if i didnt have to do it so often, Im working from home and helping my wife with our newborn baby so i have to pause things and be away from my desk for a few min quite frequently throughout the day. This results in me spending a cumulative 5+ min of my day just holding the power button on my headset which can get pretty annoying.\\n-Not made for people with smaller heads.\\nThis is a large headset. Not the ear pieces themselves necessarily, its the head band thats the issue. At its smallest setting, it barely fits my head, and thats if i learn to ignore it still sitting on the top of my ears. Dont know if its just my short forehead or if its my big ears, probably a combination of both, either way as a full grown adult i should have to extend the headband portion ever so slightly, not have to deal with it being to big at its smallest setting. I used headsets like this when i was playing games at the age of 12 when my head was a lot smaller. And most pro gamers now days ARE younger, how is this headset supposed to cater to them when it doesnt fit the head of an adult?\\n\\nAll in all, It is a very good headset. And if you have no problems with headaches, have a larger head, and are able to be very careful with the headset and dont have any kids around it EVER, then this headset will serve all of your needs and more extremely well.\\nPersonally i still have a few weeks before i reach the return deadline so i am going to see if i can just get used to the issues that i have with it or adapt to them. Its a good and unique enough headset that i feel as though i will struggle to find another one that can do everything that i love about this headset.\\nSo i will give it a couple more weeks and update this review as to whether the issues i have with it can be overcome.\",\n",

I'm not a pro gamer, I'm no tech wiz, just a casual.\\n\\nPros:\\nThe sound quality is quite good.\\nThe versatility of use is great. Getting to move the plug in to so many different devices is quite handy.\\n\\nMid:\\nThe range. It has maybe a 10' range. I have an open concept house, and when I get up to get a drink or something with my headset, inevitably I start hearing these annoying beeps warning me that I'm put of range.\\n\\nCons:\\nThe microphone. It's one of the worst audio captures I've ever heard. Whether I'd have the mic a few inches away, right against my mouth, or anywhere in between, it always sounded like I was 30' away from the thing.

My previous headphones had been a pair of craply Beats and in comparison I enjoy the audio from these a lot better and I am able to pick up more audio details in things like Valorant.\\n\\nI really enjoy the volume wheel on the headphones as a streamer. Sometimes I need to crank audio too loud for my sensitive ears and with my old headphones I was struggling between my auditory comfort and making sure things are audible and balanced in stream.\\n\\nMy only issue is that I legitimately have no idea how loud I'm talking with these on and that the low battery beep stresses me out, lol.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Let me first start out by saying I am a casual gamer. I've been playing Xbox One for the last few years and decided to get this head set for that particular gaming system. This is a great gaming headset! I upgraded from my Turtle Beach headset that served me very well for many years. Here is what I liked and did not like about the Astro A50.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nGreat sound: Customizable pre-sets and default presets make this headset ideal for those that want to tweak their headset settings. You can easily adjust settings on this headset by using the free Astro app on any Windows PC or Apple OS computer. You can also select one of three headsets loaded on the headset by simply pushing the preset button. This cycles through three presets on the headset (1-3).\\n\\nGreat feel: This headset is lightweight. You can easily wear this for 8+ hours during those long gaming sessions and still not get fatigued by wearing it. While the headset is lightweight it is still built very very well and feel solid. You won't feel like you can easily break this headset which for the price point is a good thing. The headset also does not pinch or make my head uncomfortable in anyway and if measured out I have a large head.\\n\\nWireless: The headset is 100% wireless. The only time you will need to have the headset docked is for charging. There is no cables to get in the way between you and the gaming controller or the gaming console. The freedom is nice. With the wireless capabilities also comes outstanding range. When wearing the headset I can literally go to any area of my apartment and still hear voice and game sounds. It's also nice not being tethered to your controller or console. If you've never experience true wireless gaming this will be mind blowing for you--it was for me.\\n\\nMic: While some reviews have posted complaints about the mic quality I have had really no issues with the mic. I am careful with it and raise and lower it with ease as to not damage the mechanism. The mic is turned on and off by raising and lowering. Up is in the off/mute position and down is in the on/voice position. No complaints from anyone in my gaming party on not being able to hear me either. You may need to carefully bend the end of the mic inward to your face a bit for best results. Keep in mind that if you do this the mic will hit the headset in the off/mute position so be careful not to damage it. While it would be nice to have a switch to tap to turn the mic on or off it is also nice to have the mic up out of the way for those solo gaming sessions or if you don't feel like being social during a particular gaming session.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nAdjusting in game and voice chat volume: While there is a \\\"rocker switch\\\" to adjust game and voice chat sound it is often confusing and I find myself constantly looking to see which way I should push the switch to adjust either the game volume or voice chat volume. This is especially true if I don't use the headset for several weeks between gaming sessions. Again, I am a casual gamer so this is my experience. Opinions on this will vary!\\n\\nOverall volume: It is nice to be able to easily raise or lower overall sound volume. This is game volume and voice chat volume. The downside to the particular way this headset's volume control works is that it's on a round dial. This dial is too easily manipulated especially if you are resting in a reclined position. I find myself inadvertently lowering the volume in the middle of a gaming session and then I need to remove one hand from the gaming controller to re-adjust the volume control. This is a drawback to the design but not a deal breaker. If you never game in a reclined position you very well may never experience an issue with this!\\n\\nOverall this is light years ahead of any basic headset and even more advanced in many ways over the competitors top end headset models. If you are a serious or casual gamer this is a headset that you should check-out and you'll probably realize that this is the route to go.\\n\\nThanks for reading!\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"The headset works extremely well with my Xbox series s. It connects smoothly every time and I have not had one issue with the connection.

Great product and would recommend to anyone.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Bought this headset June 22nd, 2021. Within a month or so, I started noticing that it would make clicking and staticky noises (harsh enough to feel like it's damaging my hearing) here and there, seemingly randomly, and would occasionally cut out the audio altogether, anywhere from a split second to me having to reset my bas station manually. Because I'm such a good customer, I tried finding solutions online before contacting ASTRO, because I thought for sure the issue was on my end and I could fix it. But nothing worked.\\n\\nSo I contacted ASTRO for help in early August, and they gave me a list of options to try. I spent many hours over two or three weeks testing and trying to fix the issue, but none of them worked. I read the manufacturer warranty and, from what I remember, it said I could get it repaired, replaced, or refunded within a year for faulty parts or whatever.\\n\\nSo in late August I contacted them again to tell them nothing worked and I'm having the same issues, and requested a replacement. Instead of fulfilling my request, they simply gave me more options to try and fix it, but after so many hours of testing, I told them I was not interested in testing it further, since I had zero confidence anything would work. Instead of replacing everything, they sent a new base station.\\n\\nTook 1-2 weeks for the base station to arrive in the mail, which I received somewhere in mid September. Tested it a bunch, just like before, didn't make any difference. Contacted them back once again on October 1st to finally just replace the headset itself, as I was certain at this point it was an issue with the headset, especially since I read some reviews and questions on Amazon that mentioned the same issues I'm having. Luckily they complied right away and started the process of returning my headset and shipping a new one, but as expected I had to send mine in first.\\n\\nTook about three weeks to finally get the replacement headset in late October after extensive shipping delays. Tested it out a bit, no change. Still making all the same obnoxious, harmful noises the previous headset did. By now, I've realized the clicks and the static aren't as random as I thought, and seem to happen when certain sounds are played. It's hard to explain, but basically it can happen in any game I play or YouTube video I watch, but certain sounds trigger it more often. For instance, it happens frequently when playing Battlefield 1 multiplayer, but not as much in Jurassic World: Evolution; it's consistently worse in BF1, but still unbearable when it happens in JW:E. This only cemented my belief that the headset is faulty.\\n\\nAt this point I just decided it wasn't worth it anymore and I'd just get a refund for it, and maybe switch to wired headsets to avoid wireless issues. Got a response pretty quick telling me they don't do refunds past 30 days, but I can totally just send them back my $300 headset without a refund. No mention whether they would replace it again or anything, just \\\"feel free to send it back\\\", as if I would just \\\"donate\\\" my faulty $300 headset back to them for nothing in return.\\n\\nNever had these issues with the Turtle Beach headset I used for the 5 years prior. Only with the ASTRO A50 headset. They look and feel premium, but in practice they sound cheap as dirt. Now I seriously regret my decision to buy from ASTRO, let alone not returning it for a full refund immediately once I started having issues. Never buying from ASTRO ever again.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I've had an Astro a40 wired gaming headset for years so I was already familiar with the brand. $300 is a lot to spend on something so do your research and read the reviews both positive and negative. My personal experience is 100% positive.\\n\\nI wanted them solely for my PC since the a40's are in a different area of the room hooked up to the Xbox/Playstation/TV and having to unhook and reconnect every time I want to use the headphones is a hassle. Setting the a50's up to the PC took less than 30 seconds. Seriously. I simply connected the micro-usb to the base, connected the USB end to a free slot on my PC tower, turned the headphones on and viola! Windows 10 recognized the plug and play of a set of headphones and I was up and going in less than a minute. (Granted I made sure the toggle on the base was set to \\\"PC\\\" before I plugged everything in and turned it on)\\n\\nSound quality is excellent. Just what I expected from a set of $300 astro gaming headphones. If you want to say anything on the mic, you just swing the arm down and it unmutes. Swing it back if you want to mute. Easy. Now, they are a wee bit tight when you first put them on but give it a good session of gaming and you'll be fine. You can adjust the volume by either using the dial on the right side of the headset or simply changing the volume via your PC controls.\\n\\nBattery life is advertised at being 15 hours of life before it needs a charge. I was able to use it for a few hours right out of the box. The charging base tells you how much battery life you have left via the 4 lighted squares on the base (see pic). I haven't used up all the juice yet and it has seemed to hold up nicely. The charging is super easy. The headset will sit on the base and if charging is initiated the squares will light up and indicate how much charge the battery has by how many lights are shown. Just charge them after you get done using them (like you would with your phone) and you'll be ready to go the next time you want to use them.\\n\\nSome additional features include: the cloth ear cups are removeable if you want to clean them or purchase the mod kit that has leather ear cups. Astro provides a free 2 year license of Dolby Atmos for headphones which is useful for all of those Call of Duty players.\\n\\nRange is VERY nice. With other wireless headsets you have a range at which you can walk away from the receiver before you lose the signal. I was able to walk three rooms away and go outside before I started to notice signal loss. That is about 50' (15m) through walls and around corners. *Just make sure you mute before you go to the bathroom*\\n\\n$300 is a lot to throw down for a nice pair of headphones. But these are worth the price.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"This is a great headset with two cons: 1) Incredibly uncomfortable. Purchased a $15 leather headset pad that did the trick, but that shouldn't be necessary when paying $300 for a headset. 2) Overpriced. $220 would be fair. However, I'm alright paying $300 due to the performance increase over headsets in the $120 range. As for pros: pretty much everything else. Sound quality is very good, mic is very good, and charging base is unnecessary but rather cool and very good. You can charge while playing which is good, flip mic to silence which is good as well, and if you last them down they turn off, and then turn back on when picked up. Overall they're worth it if you have the money to spend. If you're unsure of spending that much and would rather go with something in the $100 range: grab a pair of Corsairs. Not as high of quality, but better bang for your buck.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"As you can tell from the title I wear glasses while gaming and they can cause some discomfort during longer gaming sessions with certain headphones. Not the case with these, I was surprised how well they accommodate them. Do I feel the pressure eventually, yes. But this isn't until many hours in and it is only slight. Besides that the audio quality is excellent, the software for audio adjustment is fairly user friendly, and the various buttons/settings on the headset are very useful.\\n\\nMy only drawbacks are slight, but to be thorough: the base/dock for charging can be a bit finnicky when it comes to lining up the pins correctly between the headset and the base. Also the aesthetics are not exactly my taste, but I don't stream so I don't care at all what it looks like on my head as long as it's comfortable and functional.\\n\\nIn short, it's definitely a bit pricey but in my opinion you get everything you are paying for.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"(I'm using these for PC.) first things first, out of the box. These headphones sound TERRIBLE! but worry not! download the astro command center app (the reviews for the app are all 1 star for some reason. but I had no issues with it.) then download the dolby access app. Use both of these apps to adjust all levels. There are some video's online you can use as a reference for the best settings. ALSO! keep in mind these headphones have 2 overall settings. Voice and game. Which you can adjust on the fly by the big side buttons on the right earcup. Setting it more toward voice will make voices crystal clear but will LOWER the game volume and over levels. On the flip side, set it to game to get the best out of your gaming sound. Once you have it set up right. These headphones sound AMAZING. They are super lightweight. Super comfortable.

THEIR version of the software does work but requires searching for the drivers manually and installing them manually.\\n\\nAnd finally, the top cushion that rests on the top of the user's head constantly popped off for me, to the point where now I have fastened it in place with electrical tape, it's still comfortable but I shouldn't have to tape a $300 headset out of the box.\\n\\nTL;DR: This headset is not worth this price for the out-of-box maintenance go get something newer from this company or a different company entirely.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Love the headset itself, very comfortable even with glasses on. My only complaint is the little head cushion piece did pop out and won't stay when I try to pop it back in. I've had these for about a week. For a $300 headset, you'd think they would address this issue. I've seen many other reviews stating the same thing. I superglued it into place and have had no further issues with it. It doesn't bother me because it's an easy fix. But for a $300 headset, I think the build quality could be improved.\",\n",

I use this for games where sound is significant.\\n\\nThe battery has a long life and the docking station is great and easy to use.\\n\\nThe only negative thing I have to say is I wish the game sound and voice sound is toggle to switch. This limits the options of changing the balance on the fly. You can still adjust in settings.\"\n",

            "        \"2\": \"I game a lot, specifically Valorant where aim is incredibly important. I used to have this $9 mouse that I gamed with and I thought for the longest time that my aim was just because I was bad at the game. But once I realized that maybe it wasn't and got this mouse, my gaming life changed. This mouse is so good, the reactivity and responsiveness of it is super nice. There are other gaming mice out there for like $100 but get this one because it's half the price and just as good. You can change the DPI right on the mouse on the top button and there are 4 options. It runs so smoothly it's so beautiful every time I get headtaps in my game. The battery life of it is also really good. I've had the same battery in it for like 3 months and it works just fine. It goes to sleep and then when you shake it, it comes to life. The material itself is nice, it's smooth and the grip is good. There's also buttons on the left side you can use. I'm so glad I got this mouse because now I don't have to curse myself for being trash at games when I'm actually not.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I recently got my hands on the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in its striking white variant, and I must say it's an absolute gem. This mouse deserves every bit of its 5-star rating for several compelling reasons, though it's not without a few minor quibbles.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Speedy Wireless Connectivity: The Logitech G305's wireless performance is impressive, offering responsiveness that rivals wired mice. It's perfect for fast-paced gaming, and I haven't experienced any noticeable lag. However, its wireless range could be improved, so be mindful of that.\\n\\n2. Sharp and Tactile Clicks: The mouse clicks are a standout feature for me. They're sharp, tactile, and provide a satisfying feedback that's crucial for precision in gaming. It's a pleasure to use for both gaming and everyday tasks.\\n\\n3. Comfortable Ergonomics: The G305's ergonomic design suits a claw grip style, which I personally prefer. It fits comfortably in hand, allowing for long gaming sessions without discomfort.\\n\\n4. Lightning-Fast Sensor: The sensor speed on this mouse is fantastic. It's incredibly accurate and responsive, ensuring your every movement is translated flawlessly on-screen. This is a significant advantage for gamers who demand precision.\\n\\n5. Good Battery Life: While it's not the best among wireless mice with swappable batteries, the G305's battery life is still respectable. It keeps you gaming for hours before needing a battery change.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Non-Rechargeable: One notable drawback is that the G305 relies on swappable batteries instead of being rechargeable. While this allows for uninterrupted gaming by swapping batteries, it can be a hassle to source and replace them.\\n\\n2. Limited Software Customization: The Logitech G-Hub software, while functional, leaves something to be desired in terms of customization options. I wish it offered more advanced features to truly unlock the mouse's potential.\\n\\n3. Easily Pressed Side Buttons: The side buttons, while of good quality, are somewhat prone to accidental presses due to their placement. This may be a minor inconvenience for some users.\\n\\n4. Prone to Dirt: The white variant of the G305 is a stunner, but it does attract dirt and smudges relatively easily. Regular cleaning is needed to keep it looking pristine.\\n\\nOverall, at a price point of $35, the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in white is an exceptional buy. Its swift wireless connectivity, tactile clicks, comfortable design for claw grip users, and blazing sensor speed make it a top-notch gaming mouse. While rechargeability and more comprehensive software features would be nice additions, they don't detract significantly from the overall value. If you're looking for a budget-friendly yet high-performance gaming mouse, the G305 is an excellent choice that won't disappoint.\",\n",

The sensor is very nice & accurate and the side buttons are not too easy to press and are satisfying to press. The mouse is a little too heavy (only slightly) and the buttons sloped a little too far down to work very well as a fingertip mouse. But as a claw mouse, it works pretty well! I'd give this an 8/10 :)\",\n",

Worth the money if you're not willing to spend 60-100 bucks for a better mouse.\",\n",

            "        \"8\": \"Logitech has always been known for their wireless keyboards and mice, and this one is no exception. In 2016, Logitech was the first to create a wireless technology that has no interference with other wireless devices, and can respond as fast as a wired mouse plugged in via USB. Ever since, Logitech's wireless gaming mice have been outstanding in terms of performance.\\n\\nAnd this mouse is no exception. While it may not look like much considering there are no LED's, tons of buttons, gimmicks, etc. Its just a pure performance wireless mouse.\\n\\n**SHAPE**\\nThe shape originates from the G-Pro mouse released in 2016. That mouse's shape was based on the popular G100s mouse, but added RGB and a top sensor. This mouse is same exact shape: Ambidextrous, but with side buttons on the left side only. The shape is perfect in my opinion, its a lower profile mouse but it still has a hump towards the middle for additional comfort.\\n\\n**BUTTONS**\\nThe buttons are not the best in my opinion. While the left and right clicks are crisp and tactile, they are a little too tactile for my taste. They're loud, have a little too much travel, etc. They actually feel even more heavy than the original G-Pro buttons. The left and right clicks are rated only for 10 million clicks as opposed to the 20 or 50 million found in other mice. The side buttons are a bit mushy with a LOT of travel, but they work as expected. The scroll wheel is a bit heavy but has noticeable steps and is still quite smooth. Overall, the buttons are decent, but the left and right clicks really need some more tension.\\n\\n**WEIGHT**\\nThis mouse weighs about 96 grams with the AA battery it comes with. However, you can reduce the weight by using a AAA battery with a converter, or even using an AAA battery with tinfoil. But this mouse is very popular among the gaming mouse modding community, I've seen people do some mods to this mouse to get it to below 70 grams.\\n\\n**FEET**\\nThe feet are just your basic Logitech mouse feet. A little scratchy, but still smooth and fast. Not the worst stock feet I've used.\\n\\n**SENSOR**\\nHow does this mouse have such good battery life? Well, the Hero sensor does just that. It uses the second gen Hero sensor, as the first gen Hero sensor found in the G603 was able to spin out with the tilt slam when this second gen Hero sensor doesn't. The Hero sensor was designed by Logitech to give almost the same performance as the popular PMW3366 sensor by Pixart, but at the same time, gives you almost double the battery life. It can track anywhere from 100 to 12,000 DPI in steps of 50. Has no issues with stuttering, spinouts, acceleration, etc. Feels exactly like the PMW3366. It can also be used at: 125, 250, 500 or 1000 HZ polling rate. Truly a revolutionary sensor.\\n\\n**SOFTWARE**\\nThis mouse can either be used with Logitech Gaming Software or G-Hub. I personally use LGS as I find it to be more stable and easy to use compared to G-Hub. In the software, you can set profiles, DPI, macros, you name it. The only option missing is your lighting options as this mouse doesn't have any LED's except the DPI indicator which is either white when you're on a normal DPI setting or yellow if you're on a DPI shift setting.\\n\\n**POWER**\\nAs I stated above when talking about the weight, this mouse powered by a AA battery. With that said, that means you can't use a cable to re-charge the mouse, or use the powerplay pad. But you really don't need either of those, because of the Hero sensor's power efficiency. In gaming mode it can last up to 250 hours under CONTINUOUS use. That's 10 days without a break. If you set it to endurance mode, it can last up 9 MONTHS! (Endurance mode saves by battery by limiting the polling rate to 125 HZ). But they're is advantages with using a traditional battery. First if you drain the battery or it somehow goes bad, you just replace it. You won't have to send the mouse in for RMA if the battery fails, like on the G703 for example. And secondly, they last a lot longer. Even the G703 with the Hero sensor can last up to 35 hours of continuous use with the lights on, but the G305 can last up to 10 days. See the difference?\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**\\nThis mouse is a GREAT choice for those who want to get a wireless gaming mouse without breaking the bank. You're giving up on the lighter weight of other mice, LED's and other features, but for the price you pay, you gotta cut corners somewhere.\",\n",

            "        \"10\": \"I have been using a G Pro wired for the last 3 years followed by both a black and a white G305 on a desktop and a laptop for the last year. This review is about what I\\u2019d like to see in an updated version of the G305 mouse. I really hope that there will be an update because despite various points I will discuss below, it is the best mouse that I have used both in terms of performance and shape. The devil is in the details, and since most of the good design considerations that lead to better mice for us, the consumers are now well established and understood it is more important than ever to really pay attention to the details.\\n\\n1. Sensor: Bad sensors in gaming mice have become a thing of the past. Sadly this is not true for mice in general, but hopefully soon the \\u201cnon-gaming\\u201d mice will catch on. More on this below. It is important to remember that laser sensors at one point almost took over. Market pressures and advertising every so often can lead to bad decisions.\\n\\n2. Connection: With the introduction of G305, wireless has become a viable option. I use my G305 with an AA to AAA adapter and a rechargeable AAA battery to reduce weight. My estimation is that I get about 400 hours on a fully charged AAA battery having set the mouse on HI Performance, 1000Hz. This is more than enough, and I think a very good option for both desktop and laptop use, having the ability to easily change rechargeable batteries a few times a year. This is an important accomplishment in the world of computer mice in general, as it should put more pressure on non-gaming mice and their sensors, which currently it hasn\\u2019t. Another great option introduced by Logitech is the charging pad, especially for a desktop. A battery whether integrated or replaceable will always add some weight compared to a wired mouse, but having no cable (no matter how flexible) has its own advantages. In order to reduce even more weight what I would really like to see in the future is the use of one AAA battery instead of AA (an adapter has its own weight) and rechargeable mice with a POWERCORE module integrated into the body, rather than requiring an add-on piece. A further reduction in weight might be possible by even removing the charging port, so it would be strictly designed for the recharging pad.\\n\\n3. Weight: G305 is light in weight, especially with an AAA battery, just under 90g, but it can be even lighter with a more aggressive design. Of course punched holes in the shell are not necessary and even not ideal as stronger and lighter thin shell is possible with a well designed construction. Although it is a marketing strategy, it reveals that consumers are not scared of seeing electronic components. It might be a useful thing to keep in mind when designing mice with replaceable batteries in order to reduce unneeded plastic used around battery compartments.\\n\\n4. Shape: I am a fingertip grip user. My hand is slightly over 7 inches from the end of my wrist to the tip of my middle finger. I probably have smaller than average hand for a guy, but likely about average overall. I really like the shape and size of G305 as well as the placement of its buttons and the texture of the plastic. It is not perfect, but it comes the closest compared to many gaming mice I\\u2019ve tried or used over the years. I do think that there is a small room for improvement, which I am showing in the image that I have included, but any changes made to the shape need to be handled with restraint. The only two areas of improvement that I see is making the mouse slightly wider with more ergonomic curves designed for right hand use only (with a separate left hand version).\\n\\n5. Buttons: I really like the number of buttons on G305 as well as their placement and mechanism. The mechanism for the two main buttons in particular is a great design which has been used by many of the top Logitech mice for years now, but it does lower the tension which makes the buttons too sensitive. My favorite buttons on a mouse were from Logitech G9x, and although great I wish the main buttons on G305 had the same mechanism as the ones on G9x. Additionally, there is a flaw and an obvious overlook during quality control in the design of G305\\u2019s two side buttons. The small PCB onto which the side switches are mounted is either thinner than originally intended, or ended up not quite in the right place, allowing a small gap between the plunger of the switches and the plastic buttons, making it necessary to press the buttons much deeper than they need to be in order to actuate the switches. I was able to fix the issue, but not without opening the mouse.\\n\\n6. Switches: This is an area that is long overdue for an overhaul. I\\u2019m not sure which company first started the trend many years ago of publishing the durability of their switches in number of clicks (10, 20, 30, 40 million), but sadly we have all fallen into a trap set by marketing pressures. Omron, the company that manufactures the switches do sell retail Omron switches with a branding on them Omron Japan, but not rated for this high number of clicks. Apparently some time ago mouse manufacturers decided to start using non-retail switches from Omron, likely at lower prices, which they then tested in-house and assigned the 20 million clicks that their marketing department made us think we need to have in our mice. The only problem being is that those non-retail switches are actually more often than not lower quality than their retail versions and the 20 million clicks rating being absolutely meaningless as it doesn\\u2019t represent real life variable pressure usage over time. When once the buttons of a regular mouse that came with an old PC might last for 10 years now might only last a few months before a \\u201c20 million\\u201d switch starts to misbehave. In case somebody is wondering, Omron D2F-01F for the primary buttons and Omron D2F-01 for the secondary buttons is what we need to have back in our mice. The F version has about half the actuation force, which is great for instant response and effortless repeated clicks, while the other version gives better tactility.\\n\\n7. Scroll wheel: It seems that for the most part a good design has become a standard among gaming mice. This means no side tilt, no free-spin, and step scrolling with just the right amount of force and feedback. Before buying G Pro I used G303 for about a year and a half. I can see a very clear evolution in the mechanism and encoders being used between G303, G Pro wired and G305. G303 had a fantastic scroll wheel with the only flaw being prone to debris interfering with the encoder sensor. G Pro wired used an encoder that becomes too loose, while G305 is pretty much perfect. There is room for improvement, however. The rubber ridges on the wheel of the G305 are unnecessarily small and pronounced, feeling unpleasantly sharp. The rubber texture of the G903 is a good example of a perfect rubber ring for a scroll wheel. The other area that can be improved is the middle button, and more specifically its switch. The mechanism of the wheel in G305 looks great and will likely allow the middle button to actuate with the same amount of force and give the same feedback as the other secondary buttons, but the switch needs to be Omron D2F-01. Currently the small switch that\\u2019s used is fine, but there are mice with Omron sized switches in the middle button and it is definitely an improvement.\\n\\n8. Software: G HUB needs refinement. This has always been a strong point for Logitech, and their software continues to be great both in terms of functionality and stability, but their new interface needs to be simplified for ease of use.\\n\\n9. Feet: The original feet are fine, but I didn\\u2019t use the mouse with them very long as I had to remove them in order to open the mouse to fix or change some of the parts as discussed above. Unfortunately Logitech still does not sell spare mouse feet for this mouse. This might be due to the fact that for some reason they decided to make one of them very small and with a different thickness than the other four mouse feet. Can we please have all mouse feet the same thickness, not have too many and too small, and not have them cover the screw holes?\\n\\nThis would have to be it for now. As always don\\u2019t forget to disable \\u201cEnhance pointer precision\\u201d in Windows mouse settings, and in the unlikely event that somebody from Microsoft reads this, if possible, please kindly make it disabled by default, or better yet, remove the option completely. Thank you very much, and we\\u2019ll be grateful for years to come.\"\n",

            "        \"2\": \"I game a lot, specifically Valorant where aim is incredibly important. I used to have this $9 mouse that I gamed with and I thought for the longest time that my aim was just because I was bad at the game. But once I realized that maybe it wasn't and got this mouse, my gaming life changed. This mouse is so good, the reactivity and responsiveness of it is super nice. There are other gaming mice out there for like $100 but get this one because it's half the price and just as good. You can change the DPI right on the mouse on the top button and there are 4 options. It runs so smoothly it's so beautiful every time I get headtaps in my game. The battery life of it is also really good. I've had the same battery in it for like 3 months and it works just fine. It goes to sleep and then when you shake it, it comes to life. The material itself is nice, it's smooth and the grip is good. There's also buttons on the left side you can use. I'm so glad I got this mouse because now I don't have to curse myself for being trash at games when I'm actually not.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I recently got my hands on the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in its striking white variant, and I must say it's an absolute gem. This mouse deserves every bit of its 5-star rating for several compelling reasons, though it's not without a few minor quibbles.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. Speedy Wireless Connectivity: The Logitech G305's wireless performance is impressive, offering responsiveness that rivals wired mice. It's perfect for fast-paced gaming, and I haven't experienced any noticeable lag. However, its wireless range could be improved, so be mindful of that.\\n\\n2.

            "        \"8\": \"Logitech has always been known for their wireless keyboards and mice, and this one is no exception. In 2016, Logitech was the first to create a wireless technology that has no interference with other wireless devices, and can respond as fast as a wired mouse plugged in via USB. Ever since, Logitech's wireless gaming mice have been outstanding in terms of performance.\\n\\nAnd this mouse is no exception. While it may not look like much considering there are no LED's, tons of buttons, gimmicks, etc. Its just a pure performance wireless mouse.\\n\\n**SHAPE**\\nThe shape originates from the G-Pro mouse released in 2016. That mouse's shape was based on the popular G100s mouse, but added RGB and a top sensor. This mouse is same exact shape: Ambidextrous, but with side buttons on the left side only. The shape is perfect in my opinion, its a lower profile mouse but it still has a hump towards the middle for additional comfort.\\n\\n**BUTTONS**\\nThe buttons are not the best in my opinion. While the left and right clicks are crisp and tactile, they are a little too tactile for my taste. They're loud, have a little too much travel, etc. They actually feel even more heavy than the original G-Pro buttons. The left and right clicks are rated only for 10 million clicks as opposed to the 20 or 50 million found in other mice. The side buttons are a bit mushy with a LOT of travel, but they work as expected. The scroll wheel is a bit heavy but has noticeable steps and is still quite smooth. Overall, the buttons are decent, but the left and right clicks really need some more tension.\\n\\n**WEIGHT**\\nThis mouse weighs about 96 grams with the AA battery it comes with. However, you can reduce the weight by using a AAA battery with a converter, or even using an AAA battery with tinfoil. But this mouse is very popular among the gaming mouse modding community, I've seen people do some mods to this mouse to get it to below 70 grams.\\n\\n**FEET**\\nThe feet are just your basic Logitech mouse feet. A little scratchy, but still smooth and fast. Not the worst stock feet I've used.\\n\\n**SENSOR**\\nHow does this mouse have such good battery life? Well, the Hero sensor does just that. It uses the second gen Hero sensor, as the first gen Hero sensor found in the G603 was able to spin out with the tilt slam when this second gen Hero sensor doesn't. The Hero sensor was designed by Logitech to give almost the same performance as the popular PMW3366 sensor by Pixart, but at the same time, gives you almost double the battery life. It can track anywhere from 100 to 12,000 DPI in steps of 50. Has no issues with stuttering, spinouts, acceleration, etc. Feels exactly like the PMW3366. It can also be used at: 125, 250, 500 or 1000 HZ polling rate. Truly a revolutionary sensor.\\n\\n**SOFTWARE**\\nThis mouse can either be used with Logitech Gaming Software or G-Hub. I personally use LGS as I find it to be more stable and easy to use compared to G-Hub. In the software, you can set profiles, DPI, macros, you name it. The only option missing is your lighting options as this mouse doesn't have any LED's except the DPI indicator which is either white when you're on a normal DPI setting or yellow if you're on a DPI shift setting.\\n\\n**POWER**\\nAs I stated above when talking about the weight, this mouse powered by a AA battery. With that said, that means you can't use a cable to re-charge the mouse, or use the powerplay pad. But you really don't need either of those, because of the Hero sensor's power efficiency. In gaming mode it can last up to 250 hours under CONTINUOUS use. That's 10 days without a break. If you set it to endurance mode, it can last up 9 MONTHS! (Endurance mode saves by battery by limiting the polling rate to 125 HZ). But they're is advantages with using a traditional battery. First if you drain the battery or it somehow goes bad, you just replace it. You won't have to send the mouse in for RMA if the battery fails, like on the G703 for example. And secondly, they last a lot longer. Even the G703 with the Hero sensor can last up to 35 hours of continuous use with the lights on, but the G305 can last up to 10 days. See the difference?\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**\\nThis mouse is a GREAT choice for those who want to get a wireless gaming mouse without breaking the bank. You're giving up on the lighter weight of other mice, LED's and other features, but for the price you pay, you gotta cut corners somewhere.\",\n",

            "        \"10\": \"I have been using a G Pro wired for the last 3 years followed by both a black and a white G305 on a desktop and a laptop for the last year. This review is about what I\\u2019d like to see in an updated version of the G305 mouse. I really hope that there will be an update because despite various points I will discuss below, it is the best mouse that I have used both in terms of performance and shape. The devil is in the details, and since most of the good design considerations that lead to better mice for us, the consumers are now well established and understood it is more important than ever to really pay attention to the details.\\n\\n1. Sensor: Bad sensors in gaming mice have become a thing of the past. Sadly this is not true for mice in general, but hopefully soon the \\u201cnon-gaming\\u201d mice will catch on. More on this below. It is important to remember that laser sensors at one point almost took over. Market pressures and advertising every so often can lead to bad decisions.\\n\\n2. Connection: With the introduction of G305, wireless has become a viable option. I use my G305 with an AA to AAA adapter and a rechargeable AAA battery to reduce weight. My estimation is that I get about 400 hours on a fully charged AAA battery having set the mouse on HI Performance, 1000Hz. This is more than enough, and I think a very good option for both desktop and laptop use, having the ability to easily change rechargeable batteries a few times a year. This is an important accomplishment in the world of computer mice in general, as it should put more pressure on non-gaming mice and their sensors, which currently it hasn\\u2019t. Another great option introduced by Logitech is the charging pad, especially for a desktop. A battery whether integrated or replaceable will always add some weight compared to a wired mouse, but having no cable (no matter how flexible) has its own advantages. In order to reduce even more weight what I would really like to see in the future is the use of one AAA battery instead of AA (an adapter has its own weight) and rechargeable mice with a POWERCORE module integrated into the body, rather than requiring an add-on piece. A further reduction in weight might be possible by even removing the charging port, so it would be strictly designed for the recharging pad.\\n\\n3. Weight: G305 is light in weight, especially with an AAA battery, just under 90g, but it can be even lighter with a more aggressive design. Of course punched holes in the shell are not necessary and even not ideal as stronger and lighter thin shell is possible with a well designed construction. Although it is a marketing strategy, it reveals that consumers are not scared of seeing electronic components. It might be a useful thing to keep in mind when designing mice with replaceable batteries in order to reduce unneeded plastic used around battery compartments.\\n\\n4. Shape: I am a fingertip grip user. My hand is slightly over 7 inches from the end of my wrist to the tip of my middle finger. I probably have smaller than average hand for a guy, but likely about average overall. I really like the shape and size of G305 as well as the placement of its buttons and the texture of the plastic. It is not perfect, but it comes the closest compared to many gaming mice I\\u2019ve tried or used over the years. I do think that there is a small room for improvement, which I am showing in the image that I have included, but any changes made to the shape need to be handled with restraint. The only two areas of improvement that I see is making the mouse slightly wider with more ergonomic curves designed for right hand use only (with a separate left hand version).\\n\\n5. Buttons: I really like the number of buttons on G305 as well as their placement and mechanism. The mechanism for the two main buttons in particular is a great design which has been used by many of the top Logitech mice for years now, but it does lower the tension which makes the buttons too sensitive. My favorite buttons on a mouse were from Logitech G9x, and although great I wish the main buttons on G305 had the same mechanism as the ones on G9x. Additionally, there is a flaw and an obvious overlook during quality control in the design of G305\\u2019s two side buttons. The small PCB onto which the side switches are mounted is either thinner than originally intended, or ended up not quite in the right place, allowing a small gap between the plunger of the switches and the plastic buttons, making it necessary to press the buttons much deeper than they need to be in order to actuate the switches. I was able to fix the issue, but not without opening the mouse.\\n\\n6. Switches: This is an area that is long overdue for an overhaul. I\\u2019m not sure which company first started the trend many years ago of publishing the durability of their switches in number of clicks (10, 20, 30, 40 million), but sadly we have all fallen into a trap set by marketing pressures. Omron, the company that manufactures the switches do sell retail Omron switches with a branding on them Omron Japan, but not rated for this high number of clicks. Apparently some time ago mouse manufacturers decided to start using non-retail switches from Omron, likely at lower prices, which they then tested in-house and assigned the 20 million clicks that their marketing department made us think we need to have in our mice. The only problem being is that those non-retail switches are actually more often than not lower quality than their retail versions and the 20 million clicks rating being absolutely meaningless as it doesn\\u2019t represent real life variable pressure usage over time. When once the buttons of a regular mouse that came with an old PC might last for 10 years now might only last a few months before a \\u201c20 million\\u201d switch starts to misbehave. In case somebody is wondering, Omron D2F-01F for the primary buttons and Omron D2F-01 for the secondary buttons is what we need to have back in our mice. The F version has about half the actuation force, which is great for instant response and effortless repeated clicks, while the other version gives better tactility.\\n\\n7. Scroll wheel: It seems that for the most part a good design has become a standard among gaming mice. This means no side tilt, no free-spin, and step scrolling with just the right amount of force and feedback. Before buying G Pro I used G303 for about a year and a half. I can see a very clear evolution in the mechanism and encoders being used between G303, G Pro wired and G305. G303 had a fantastic scroll wheel with the only flaw being prone to debris interfering with the encoder sensor. G Pro wired used an encoder that becomes too loose, while G305 is pretty much perfect. There is room for improvement, however. The rubber ridges on the wheel of the G305 are unnecessarily small and pronounced, feeling unpleasantly sharp. The rubber texture of the G903 is a good example of a perfect rubber ring for a scroll wheel. The other area that can be improved is the middle button, and more specifically its switch. The mechanism of the wheel in G305 looks great and will likely allow the middle button to actuate with the same amount of force and give the same feedback as the other secondary buttons, but the switch needs to be Omron D2F-01. Currently the small switch that\\u2019s used is fine, but there are mice with Omron sized switches in the middle button and it is definitely an improvement.\\n\\n8. Software: G HUB needs refinement. This has always been a strong point for Logitech, and their software continues to be great both in terms of functionality and stability, but their new interface needs to be simplified for ease of use.\\n\\n9. Feet: The original feet are fine, but I didn\\u2019t use the mouse with them very long as I had to remove them in order to open the mouse to fix or change some of the parts as discussed above. Unfortunately Logitech still does not sell spare mouse feet for this mouse. This might be due to the fact that for some reason they decided to make one of them very small and with a different thickness than the other four mouse feet. Can we please have all mouse feet the same thickness, not have too many and too small, and not have them cover the screw holes?\\n\\nThis would have to be it for now. As always don\\u2019t forget to disable \\u201cEnhance pointer precision\\u201d in Windows mouse settings, and in the unlikely event that somebody from Microsoft reads this, if possible, please kindly make it disabled by default, or better yet, remove the option completely. Thank you very much, and we\\u2019ll be grateful for years to come.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"I\\u2019ve gone through exactly 3 headsets (The official Microsoft Xbox One headset, PlayStation Gold Wireless headset 2018, and a Razor headset) looking for a viable option that had both DECENT audio and mic quality, as all the headsets I\\u2019ve purchased have had build quality issues and terrible mic quality. I\\u2019ve given up on picking up a wireless headset as from what I\\u2019ve seen, are incredibly expensive. I saw the ad for the SteelSeries Arctic 1 headset and it seemed too good to be true (very cheap price for a wireless headset, and interchange between 3 consoles) and to my surprise, it lived up to pretty much all its claims.\\n\\nWireless connectivity works seamlessly with its included dongle, and I have had zero dropouts or latency issues with it on both PS4 and Nintendo Switch. I originally purchased this headset primarily for the PS4, as I imagined wireless headsets were completely incompatible with the Nintendo Switch, but the headset does in-fact work effortlessly and all the buttons on the headset (Mic Mute On/Off, Volume Dial) work on both systems. Mic quality is excellent as well as audio quality, it\\u2019s perfectly balanced and not ridiculously skewed towards bass, and the volume can be raised very high on both consoles if you want. Battery life so far has also been great, it\\u2019s something I haven\\u2019t had to worry about when using and I only had to charge them once every week out of habit. The headset itself doesn\\u2019t feel flimsy and seems decently built, It\\u2019s pretty light and is surprisingly comfortable to wear, so much I use it also when I\\u2019m on my laptop. The only thing that slightly annoys me is that when I switch playing consoles and want to use the headset on it, I have to get up and unplug the headset dongle and connect it to the console I\\u2019m using (say, from the PS4 to the Nintendo Switch). This is pretty much a first world problem, but it\\u2019s something I\\u2019ve come across every once in a while.\\n\\nOverall I have to say I\\u2019m really loving this headset, if you were on the fence for this thing I really recommend you give it a try.\\n\\nUPDATE June 2020: It\\u2019s been 8 months since I\\u2019ve bought this headset, and I just wanted to report back that it has held up ROCK SOLID. This thing is by all means not flimsy, and the battery life has held up incredibly well. I\\u2019ve been gaming really long sessions, roughly 5-6 hours long each with friends online, and this thing just keeps going with no issues whatsoever. One of the few purchases I\\u2019ve made that I can say was absolutely worth it.\\n\\nFINAL UPDATE April 2021: Managed to get myself a PS5 and happy to say the headset works flawlessly with it. The new thing I love about the headset now is that the PS5 has a USB-C port in the front, which means you don\\u2019t have to use the included cable that comes with the headset dongle for USB-A, you can plug it directly to the PS5 and it sits flush and is almost unnoticeable.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"As an average gamer, non-audiophile, and PC user, I bought and used a pair of Astro A20s as my first wireless headset and I regret it deeply. The mic was really sensitive; any sort of breath, head movement, adjusting of the headset, background noise, etc would come through. Not only that, but I would also hear static and crackling noises occasionally. Also, if I would move my head at all, the headset would creak. Very annoying. On multiple occasions, I would find that when I turned on my PC, the dongle would disconnect and require a cycle of pressing the button and restarting the computer until it would connect again. Resorted to permanently leaving my PC on because of this. The directional sound was also non-existent...false advertising.\\nI DON'T HAVE ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS WITH THIS NEW HEADSET!!!\\nThe sound is amazing; I can hear sounds from all directions and there is no crackling/static. The ear pads are very comfortable; I game on my PC for at least 10 hours per day, and I have yet to experience any soreness or fatigue. Noise cancelling on the mic is excellent. The range is pretty good; I can walk from my room to the downstairs kitchen without the headset disconnecting. The headset is also rhythm game-friendly, as the audio does not lag or desync at all--a problem I experienced with the A20. Battery life seems to be accurate. My only gripe is that I have to download the SteelSeries software to customize the audio, which requires creating an account and giving out my email address.\\nOverall, if you are not an audiophile and want a good wireless headset for a budget-friendly price, I highly recommend the Arctis 1. I'm sure any other SteelSeries model is great; my sister has the Arctis 7 and loves it. I settled with this one because it was the cheapest I could find (and less expensive than the A20).\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Okay let me start off and say that this headset is TREMENDOUSLY GOOD. I been using Astros for years and i kinda got burnt out on it & i wanted to try something new and then i came across Steelseries Arctis 1 Wireless. I\\u2019ve heard about Steelseries for quite sometime but never really bothered getting a headset until now.\\n\\nComfort 10/10 : Let me honestly say that this is the most comfortable headset i have ever wore in my entire life. I\\u2019ve been through Astro A40s, Astro A50s, Turtle Beach ( I don\\u2019t recommend btw ) , Somy headsets and this took me by surprise. For a $100!? It\\u2019s honestly amazing. The clamping force is really not bad. Doesn\\u2019t hurt your ears or anything when putting them on. Also the very soft leather material they use on the Ear Cups is the best i have felt.\\n\\nDurability 10/10 : Now you may think it looks like a very cheap plastic. I\\u2019m gonna let you know that it\\u2019s not. They use a very strong plastic & what makes this even better is the very strong reinforced steel they use on the headband which makes it very durable and flexible. This doesn\\u2019t mean you can just throw your headset because it\\u2019s that durable. As every other gaming headset just take them off gently and place them down gently to avoid any damage. Overall you don\\u2019t have to worry about this breaking on you unlike that cheap plastic that Turtle Beach use. If i can compare to another headset in terms of durability it would be Astros. It\\u2019s that good.\\n\\nSound 10/10 : Boy oh Boy let me just say. When i first hooked these up i was SHOCKINGLY stunned how loud these were. It was to the point i legit had to turn them down a notch because it was that loud. You definitely get your bass, Low, Mids & Highs. You have very good directional sounds so you can hear enemy footsteps from behind, front, ledt & right perfectly well and you can also tell weather they\\u2019re up top or at the bottom. Overall the Sound Quality is top tier so don\\u2019t listen to the reviews of ppl saying it\\u2019s bad\\n\\nNoise Cancellation 10/10 : Steelseries definitely nailed it on this one. When you put this on you cam barely hear anything in the background. There was times i had to take these off to actually hear what they\\u2019re saying. Probably one of the best i seen if you ask me.\\n\\nMic Monitoring 10/10 : Now let me get this straight. Ppl said the mic was terrible but they\\u2019re wrong . Let me tell you that this Mic sounds very crisp and clear. As far as i stated before with the noise cancellation ppl can barely hear anything in your background with this mic. So if you got a PS4 that sounds like an AC130 taking off this will cover it 100% and i also love the fact it\\u2019s w Clearcast mic which is why it\\u2019s even better. You can also use the Steelseries EQ Engine to adjust any of these features above to your liking weather you wanna tweak the sounds or the mic etc so that\\u2019s a W for Steelseries.\\n\\nOverall Review : These are definitely worth $100. I recommend anyone to get this if you\\u2019re struggling to get a good headset especially the more expensive premium ones. Although this headset does feel very premium if you ask me. You won\\u2019t be disappointed with this product at all. By far my new favorite headset along with Astros.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I've always been pleased with Steel Series headphones and the Arctis 1 wireless is another great example of why I continue to buy their products.\\n\\nThe feel and fitment on the head is very good. After 4-6 hours, there's no discomfort. Lots of room in the ear cups with a good amount of padding.\\nI use mine for gaming on the ps5. The battery life seems to be close enough to what they advertise. First time use was as simple as plugging the included dongle into the front of the ps5 and turning on the headphones. The sound quality is good and very well balanced. It's loud enough that I normally turn it down to around 60-70% volume. Didn't distort at max volume as well. It comes with 3 cables: A micro usb, usb-c to usb extension for the included dongle, and a 3.5 mm audio cable for headphone jacks.\\nCons:\\n-The micro usb charging port is very inconvenient and outdated.\\n-The ear cups are fabric and will be harder to clean.\\n-To turn the headphones on and off require you to press and hold the power button for several seconds each time. A simple switch would have been better.\\n-The overall style and design is kinda dull and nothing to write home about.\\nOverall, I'm satisfied with these headphones. If you want a no nonsense pair of headphones that are reliable and get the job done, these are worth considering.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"So firstly the cons:\\n- the microphone quality is just above 2002 YouTube video quality. Its okay.\\n- the microphone's \\\"noise cancelling\\\" is also okay.\\n- the microphone does not noise cancel when things brush the microphone so do bear that in mind.\\n- the headsets range is about 40? Feet.\\n- the headset creeks and sounds like it's on the verge of breaking constantly and feels cheap\\n\\nPros!\\n- easy to setup and get working\\n- easy to use their basic app to setup an EQ\\n- once eq'd it sounds lovely\\n- ear pads are pretty much universal\\n- despite its creeking and cheap feel, it's tough as an ox\\n- it's 70ish dollars\\n- a better headset is significantly more than 70 dollars\\n- better headsets than are wireless break significantly easier and are not 70 dollars\\n- keeps out enough noise to ignore your surroundings but not enough that you can't hear what's going on\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I usually dont bother writing reviews, but this headset is so perfect that i just had to. I cant believe how well they fit, how comfortable they are right out of the box, and how amazing they sound. The crispness of the audio is evident right away. I have gone through many headsets. I had the X41 Turtle beaches, the stealth 600 gen 1 and gen 2 as well as other foreign gaming headsets that were supposedly great, and these blow all of them away in every category. They look great, the head band part is flexible so it wont break, the comfort is 10 our of 10, and most importantly the sound is so clear and you can always tell exactly what direction an enemy is coming from in shooter games. Another thing that i love about this headset is the wireless dongle they use. Instead of a USB, its a dongle that fits the Playstation, my computer, my laptop, and my Android phone. It just works the way its supposed to on every device. Also, the microphone is detachable too so you dont need to have it on all the time if you dont want to. They thought of everything with these headsets. And the battery lasts a long time as well. I will never buy another type of wireless gaming headset other than this. I believe it will last for years to come but that remains to be seen. You cant go wrong with these. 10 out of 10 overall from me.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Disclaimer: While I am a big headphones enthusiasts (have tried/owned many different pairs), this only my second gaming headset, as I have usually played video games through speakers. I previously had a cheap Turtle Beach set that I used for PS4 multiplayer games with friends and family. Since building a new gaming PC 4 months ago, I've been using headphones for gaming more often. I've also had to use headphones for work since my job has moved to WFH for the foreseeable future. My favorite cans are currently my modded Koss Pro DJ100 w/ a good amp (closed set) and the Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro (open set) which I also use for mixing/editing audio tracks. I bought these because I needed a wireless set for couch gaming when I run my PC into my TV.\\n\\nComfort & Looks: Arctis 1 = 4/5; Arctis 7 = 4.5/5\\nThe plastic finish and plain look are OK but not amazing. For $100 dollars the look and feel is totally serviceable. There are some rough-ish edges on the headband, but everything else is smooth. The clamping force is a little tight for me personally, but it's comfortable otherwise (not too hot, headband rests OK, can move around just fine, etc). My partner has a smaller head than me and they love the Arctis 1 so far with no complaints (it is now their main headphone for working and gaming). The Arctis 7 is excellent for me and the headband is very comfy. The clamping pressure is less but still allows for movement without falling off my head. I like the slightly cleaner look & feel of the 7, but the 1 is sturdy in its own right (if just a little rough).\\n\\nSound: Arctis 1 = 4/5; Arctis 7 = 4.5/5\\nThe sound on the Arctis 1 is quite good for a $100 wireless set (although not an audiophile set exactly). Definitely a mainstream gaming EQ curve (extra bass, slightly scooped mid). The details are fine and the soundstage works well with stereo effects in music or games (like enemies clunking around in FPS games). There's OK high extension but they're slightly attenuated. Mids are generally accurate but there seems to be more prominent low and high mids honestly. After EQing in the provided software I was able to quickly set up a couple profiles (gaming and music) that sounded good to me for general gaming and listening. The Arctis 7 isn't incredibly different although I feel it's a little more balanced and has better isolation. The soundstage also feels a little more realistic to me personally and it feels just a little more detailed. The surround sound is OK, but I'm honestly fine with stereo imaging.\\n\\nMic/Communication Functions: Arctis 1 = 3.5/5;Arctis 7 4/5\\nThe mic is decent (same microphone on both), but it has that constant compression and low dynamic range thing going on. It's perfectly serviceable for communicating in games (and work meetings, Zoom calls, etc.), but don't try to record vocals with it or anything like that. I've been using it to teach and my students say it sounds fine compared to my usual SM58 or AT2020 setup.I should note that the Arctis 7 has game chat mix in case you want to mix the level of chat mixed into your game. It's a nice feature if you play games where chat is useful. I also love that the mic on the Arctis 7 can be pushed back up into the ear cup.\\n\\nConnectivity & Battery: Arctis 1 =4.5/5; Arctis 7 = 3.5/5\\nGreat connectivity options on the Arctis 1, especially the USB-C dongle. So easy to switch between devices (including my phone) on the fly. The Arctis 7 has a traditional USB dongle with line in/line out 1/8' jacks. It's fine but less useful than the Arctis 1 dongle for me. The battery life is great on both and they charge back up pretty quickly as well.\\n\\nTLDR: Arctis 1 has higher clamping force, better overall connectivity, and it's rougher around the edges. The Arctis 7 is comfy, better built, and has better isolation and a tuck-away mic. I think the Arctis 7 sounds just slightly better, but they're both nice wireless headphones in their own right. If you have a small to average head and want to save $50, the Arctis 1 is great. If you want more polish, have a larger head, or want slightly better communications functionality, grab the Arctis 7.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I have been using this headset for a little over a week and would like to share my experience so far.\\n\\nPros:\\n-The sound quality is great\\n-The over ear design is comfortable\\n-The 'on headset' controls are very useful (volume control, mute/unmute microphone toggle)\\n-The microphone voice clarity is great\\n-I love that the microphone can be taken off when not in use so its not always in the way\\n-The 2.4ghz dongle is USB-C but the headset does come with a USB 3.0 to USB-C adapter. So i can use it with anything.\\n-The wireless range is great\\n-Zero audio latency is amazing\\n-Long battery life\\n-Works on all of my devices (most importantly my xbox since there are ZERO wireless headsets for xbox one for some reason)\\n\\nNow, with all of those great things about it that i have never seen another headset match, there are a few things about this headset that i found to be surprising problems in a headset that is so highly rated, loved, and priced.\\nAnd i do understand that some of the issues that i have with it are going to be very specific to me, and few people that struggle with the same unique traits that i do.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Low build quality in something that has a premium price.\\nWhen i pay $100 for a headset i expect it to be top of the line in the materials used to make it. But instead it is made out of very cheap feeling plastic that is very easy to break/bend. This makes the headset feel extremely ridged and like you constantly have to be careful with it. And i dont like having to worry about that when paying so much for it. When i pay a premium price, i should feel like i am holding a premium item.\\n-HEADACHES.\\nThis is one will will probably be pretty specific to me because i am VERY prone to headaches. But to put it plainly, the headset is so NON ADJUSTABLE that it squeezes my head VERY TIGHT in just the wrong way to cause me to get a lot of tension headaches. Not what i want in a headset that i intend to be wearing for 6+ hours a day. I have tried to pull on the headband portion to make it sit a little wider on my head in an effort to make it so its not squeezing my head so tightly but thats another situation where the poor build quality comes into play. When i try to pull on it the shell is so ridged that it cant change shape at all. it just starts to bend in a way that makes the cushion on top of your head pop out and starts to look like your about to do some permanent damage to the headset. So i am forced to deal with the headset squeezing my head a lot tighter than i would prefer.\\n-Its very heavy.\\nIve used a lot of different headsets in my life and im sure its partly because of the added weight from the battery.\\nBut regardless of that when i have the headset on, i feel like my head is significantly weighed down. Even when compared to other wireless headsets ive used. This also doesnt positively effect my headaches.\\n-I have to hold the power button for a frustratingly long time to either turn it on or off but most importantly to wake it up when it puts itself into sleep mode.\\nSomething as simple as a toggle switch instead of a press and hold button would completely fix this issue. Not sure whether its just straight up turning itself off when inactive for a few min or if its goes into some kind of sleep mode, either way it is surprising how much it bothers me to do things like leave my desk for 5 min and have to hold the power button down for 5+ seconds before i can hear anything again. This wouldnt annoy me as much if i didnt have to do it so often, Im working from home and helping my wife with our newborn baby so i have to pause things and be away from my desk for a few min quite frequently throughout the day. This results in me spending a cumulative 5+ min of my day just holding the power button on my headset which can get pretty annoying.\\n-Not made for people with smaller heads.\\nThis is a large headset. Not the ear pieces themselves necessarily, its the head band thats the issue. At its smallest setting, it barely fits my head, and thats if i learn to ignore it still sitting on the top of my ears. Dont know if its just my short forehead or if its my big ears, probably a combination of both, either way as a full grown adult i should have to extend the headband portion ever so slightly, not have to deal with it being to big at its smallest setting. I used headsets like this when i was playing games at the age of 12 when my head was a lot smaller. And most pro gamers now days ARE younger, how is this headset supposed to cater to them when it doesnt fit the head of an adult?\\n\\nAll in all, It is a very good headset. And if you have no problems with headaches, have a larger head, and are able to be very careful with the headset and dont have any kids around it EVER, then this headset will serve all of your needs and more extremely well.\\nPersonally i still have a few weeks before i reach the return deadline so i am going to see if i can just get used to the issues that i have with it or adapt to them. Its a good and unique enough headset that i feel as though i will struggle to find another one that can do everything that i love about this headset.\\nSo i will give it a couple more weeks and update this review as to whether the issues i have with it can be overcome.\",\n",

I'm not a pro gamer, I'm no tech wiz, just a casual.\\n\\nPros:\\nThe sound quality is quite good.\\nThe versatility of use is great. Getting to move the plug in to so many different devices is quite handy.\\n\\nMid:\\nThe range. It has maybe a 10' range. I have an open concept house, and when I get up to get a drink or something with my headset, inevitably I start hearing these annoying beeps warning me that I'm put of range.\\n\\nCons:\\nThe microphone. It's one of the worst audio captures I've ever heard. Whether I'd have the mic a few inches away, right against my mouth, or anywhere in between, it always sounded like I was 30' away from the thing. It sounded like the only thing it was trying to capture was the room tone. Just awful.\\n\\nI'm very torn on whether I'd buy another SteelSeries headset.\",\n",

Sometimes I need to crank audio too loud for my sensitive ears and with my old headphones I was struggling between my auditory comfort and making sure things are audible and balanced in stream.\\n\\nMy only issue is that I legitimately have no idea how loud I'm talking with these on and that the low battery beep stresses me out, lol.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Update: Five Weeks Later\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else.\\n\\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they had made a lighter headset without the upgraded passthrough, but now passthrough is everything to me. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Eleven Table Tennis, and Meta Quest Browser for AR female hologram eye candy. One of the first AR games that I tried is a free game called First Encounters. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I might have bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I am sure that I will keep installed and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the default Quest 3 wall charger and link cable. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging the cord or the Quest 3 cable. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\\n\\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App lets you stream your PCVR games to your Quest headset, wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers. Virtual Desktop lets you have a virtual desktop in passthrough mode, but Immersed lets you too and in Immersed you can have up to four computer screens and you get to be around other users and their avatars. I still use Virtual Desktop for the head lock feature, which keeps the desktop screen in front of your face no matter what direction are are facing or where you move or walk to. I use it to read manhua while walking around the house for exercise. I am hoping that the headlock feature will be added to Immersed soon.\\n\\nResident Evil 4. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is VR or something but it truly is fun walking around in a realistic setting. I like the scenery better than Arizona Sunshine or The Walking Dead. The first Red Matter game was great, but sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value once you've completed the story. Green Hell looks really interesting. It's a realistic survival game. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game that is sorta interesting if co-op RPG games are your thing. It is a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. Genotype is a bit interesting. but the texture detail isn't as high as I would like.\\n\\nFor fitness, I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nI also suggest getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR). On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and mirror you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor in PCVR games. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \\\"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\\\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 65% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people to try the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much?\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \\\"pancake\\\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \\\"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\\\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \\\"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\\\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"There is no doubt this thing is superior to the Quest 2 in almost every way possible. Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.\\n\\nPros -\\nDisplay - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.\\n\\nAudio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvement\\n\\nAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nDisplay\\n\\nWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.\\n\\n1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.\\n\\n2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.\\n\\n3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.\\n\\n4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.\\n\\nComfort\\n\\nThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.\\n\\nEcosystem\\n\\nThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headset\\n\\nPassthrough\\n\\nThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR\\u00b9, thus far the native apps aren\\u2019t of interest] and didn\\u2019t use it as much as I\\u2019d expected.\\u00b2 With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I\\u2019ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2\\u2019s Fresnel lenses and the Q3\\u2019s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the \\u201csweet-spot\\u201d is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I\\u2019m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3f Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. \\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude10 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2\\u2019s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3\\u2019s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I\\u2019ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I\\u2019ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n\\u2022 battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n\\u2022 native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I\\u2019m sad there weren\\u2019t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it\\u2019s a still terrific bargain. It\\u2019s a shame about the contrast though \\ud83d\\ude39\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn\\u2019t have wifi enabled and couldn\\u2019t figure out why it wouldn\\u2019t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n\\u00b9 \\u2014 For PCVR I\\u2019m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta\\u2019s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I\\u2019ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I\\u2019ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop\\u2019s \\u201cHVEC 10-bit\\u201d encoder, which graphically is better than the plain \\u201cHVEC\\u201d encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n\\u00b2 \\u2014 Considering the price I paid vis-\\u00e0-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I've been in the VR game for a while now, going all the way back to the Oculus Rift dev kit 2 days. My other current headset is a Valve Index, and I mainly bought the Quest 3 with the intention of playing the Quest-exclusive games, fully expecting it to feel like a toy in comparison.\\n\\nIn practice, I'm in love with this thing. The displays are both high resolution and high quality, with little to no screendoor effect, and the tracking is impressively stable for something only being tracked by cameras and software. I thought the removal of the rings from the Q2 controllers would cause them to have more issues with occlusion, but I haven't noticed anything. Even the features I didn't know it had are pretty cool for the games that support them, like its mixed reality and controller-free hand tracking. But the thing that's really going to keep me away from my Index (at least for the games that aren't specifically tailored to it, like Half Life Alyx) is that I had no idea how much I needed to ditch the cable and play wirelessly until now. Being able to just walk around in my room without having to be aware of the cable behind me is such a nice feeling that it feels like I'm getting into VR for the first time again.\\n\\nWith that said, there are some small caveats -- namely, that this is not really a $500 headset. Meta has taken on a sort of Spirit Airlines approach, where the headset itself is affordably priced in exchange for other basic things being extremely expensive \\\"accessories\\\". The strap is the main offender, with the default one being the rough equivalent of just tying the headset to your head. They're happy to sell you a $60 strap, or a $130 one that extends the battery, though! And while you're at it you can blow $80 on a cable for linking it to your pc if you aren't a fan of wireless tethering, a $70 carrying case, a $40 silicone facial interface for extra comfort, a $130 charging dock to replace the controllers needing AA batteries, $40 hand straps for the controllers to give them Index-esque free-hand support... To be clear, most, if not all of these have off-brand counterparts that are just as good (or better!) for a fraction of the price, but my point is this is not a fully out of the box experience for those with more discerning tastes. For parents buying them for their younger children they'll probably be thrilled with it anyways, and can safely ignore all of that, but I would wager most adults will probably end up wanting at least a new head strap of some kind, whether it's the official one or not.\\n\\nIgnoring the troublesome accessories, though, this is an easy win as far as I'm concerned. The only real competition is that the Quest 2 is still holding its own as well from what I hear, and for prices that seem to be as low as they could possibly be around the holiday season. I can't speak first-hand on whether the Q3 is worth a $300 difference, but I can say I don't regret buying it. I held off on the Quest line of headsets because I've never been a big fan of Meta as a company, but I have to begrudgingly admit that this is probably the best vr headset at the best price you could get right now.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"The product arrived today, i recorded the opening and bootup.\\nNo dead pixels, passthrough works, there was a small issue with the nose piece not set but after looking it up it seems to be a common issue because of the way the VR opens/closes to adjust to face sizes.\\n\\nIf this occurs, gently push along the nose ridge and it will readjust itself as long as no lock-tab parts are actually damaged. I lucked out, as none of the tabs were broken and were able to go back into place.\\n\\nThe amazon box it came in again didn't have any protection what so ever. But the product itself was fine/stable in it's package box with appropriate padding.\\n\\nI had no issues getting it registered to meta, and grabbed a couple of free games that downloaded quickly enough. I haven't tried them, but I did explore the passthrough and nonpassthrough feature.\\n\\nVisual wise it's actually quite a bit more clear/crisp compared to the ps4 Vr(which is what I can compare it to). As it has a higher resolution/pixel count. I still haven't taken off the default stickers that protect the lenses until I can put on lense protectors. But even through all of the writing on the label that tells you NOT to use any form of liquid cleaners, even lense. It's visual is damn good.\\n\\nThe passthrough visual via camera is on par with a ps4 VR headset: and suffer's some glitches when it hits reflective surfaces but that is normal as camera's hate that extra reflection of light.. But interface/scenes are definitely more clear and crisp. Sound quality is good, not like being at a rock concert, but goes loud enough to enjoy. Headsets for sound actually aren't really needed for this VR.\\n\\nI haven't hooked it up to a computer yet, as it's suppose to be the 'big' gift for me and my fianc\\u00e9 to enjoy over Christmas. As it was a purchase done by the both of us - after calculating expenses..\\n\\nSo the big question: Is it worth the money?\\n\\nMy answer: Yes, I recommend going for the larger size because most of the games you will be downloading are often between 5-40gb.. With a few exceptions that could easily hit 80gb - example skyrim(haven't checked the store to see if that one is available on meta). Plus any mods one might want to add to the games.\\n\\nI was glad to see they had some of my more unique playstation favorites in their store. This made me happy, despite needing to buy it again. (Btw The Wizards* is excellent and lets you feel like your literally casting spells, or using a bow.)\\n\\nWith that said, go for the BIGGER hard drive: it will make it so your VR can hold more then 3 games without suffering quality issues. As you always want to leave room(1-5gb) for the OS(opperating system) to run smoothly. Then you won't have to worry about uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing cache/HD maintence every time you want to change your lineup.\\n\\n**For people with limited understanding of storage space 512GB should easily allow you to store 15-25games which if you have 'data' usage limits for whatever reason would avoid burn up of data by constantly downloading the same thing.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \\\"rug burn\\\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone\\u2661\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Buy the Quest 3, DO NOT BUY THE QUEST 2. I still use my Quest 2 it's great but I don't care how cheap it is, the Quest 3 is that much better in both performance and visuals. Even games not updated still look and play smoother. The Quest 3 is good enough to get into VR gaming without a PC. The Quest 1 felt like a gimmick , the Quest 2 was good but still felt compromised but the Quest 3 (while obviously not as a good the average PCVR gaming pc) is able to get much closer and provide a PCVR like experience on newer games. Mixed reality was not something I was interested in but after trying it I think it's awesome, even if you consider it a gimmick it's very cool and fun tech. As someone who really only cared about PC based VR gaming I've been very impressed with the Quest 3. After going on a VR binge in 2019 and some of 2020 I've mostly only played VRChat now but because of the Quest 3 I started exploring VR games again trying out new and old games and even mixed reality stuff too. It's that good but I'd recommend an aftermarket headstrap. The included headstrap seems pretty bad but if you fiddle with it A LOT it can get comfy. Also I returned my 128GB model and bought the 512GB one. It should not cost that much more in price but honestly there's so much cool stuff and games are slowly getting bigger. If you have fast internet , you can buy the 128GB and be fine.\\n\\nThere's tons of amateur and professional unboxing videos of the Quest 3 that you can look at if you want to see what it looks like. As for what it's like to buy and own it? It's amazing.\\nBackground info: I've been a computer based VR player since 2017 when I got the original Oculus Rift also known as the CV1 on a Black Friday sale. Since then I've bought an Index in 2020 with vive trackers for full body tracking, a Quest 1 as a backup headset, a Quest 2 and now a Quest 3. I have about 6000 hours in VR 5000 of that is in VRChat.\\nReview: The Quest 3 is incredible. It's my first VR headset that uses pancake lens and it's beautiful. I dabbled in standalone gaming on my Quest 2 with games like Resident Evil 4 VR and Iron Man VR which were both great. Iron Man felt a little held back resolution wise with aggressive foveated rendering BUT THE Quest 3 fixes that mostly with higher resolution in literally everything. Everything from the interface to all old and new games feel snappy. I started playing mixed reality mini games like the Ghost Busters one and Synth Riders and the free built in Alien one and everything has been super cool. it's all surprisingly fun. Audio is also great, about as good as the Index. The whole thing feels more reliable though as my Index cable is annoying with how heavy and thick it is. I'm on my third cable in 3 years and still the Index needs to be unplugged sometimes to make it work. I've had no such problems on my Quest 2 and Quest 3. The only reason I still use my Index is for easy full body tracking in VRChat otherwise I play everything on my Quest 3.\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Update: Five Weeks Later\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else.\\n\\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they had made a lighter headset without the upgraded passthrough, but now passthrough is everything to me. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Eleven Table Tennis, and Meta Quest Browser for AR female hologram eye candy. One of the first AR games that I tried is a free game called First Encounters. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I might have bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I am sure that I will keep installed and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the default Quest 3 wall charger and link cable. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging the cord or the Quest 3 cable. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\\n\\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App lets you stream your PCVR games to your Quest headset, wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers. Virtual Desktop lets you have a virtual desktop in passthrough mode, but Immersed lets you too and in Immersed you can have up to four computer screens and you get to be around other users and their avatars. I still use Virtual Desktop for the head lock feature, which keeps the desktop screen in front of your face no matter what direction are are facing or where you move or walk to. I use it to read manhua while walking around the house for exercise. I am hoping that the headlock feature will be added to Immersed soon.\\n\\nResident Evil 4. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is VR or something but it truly is fun walking around in a realistic setting. I like the scenery better than Arizona Sunshine or The Walking Dead. The first Red Matter game was great, but sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value once you've completed the story. Green Hell looks really interesting. It's a realistic survival game. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game that is sorta interesting if co-op RPG games are your thing. It is a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. Genotype is a bit interesting. but the texture detail isn't as high as I would like.\\n\\nFor fitness, I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nI also suggest getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR). On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and mirror you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor in PCVR games. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \\\"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\\\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 65% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people to try the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much?\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \\\"pancake\\\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \\\"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\\\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \\\"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\\\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"There is no doubt this thing is superior to the Quest 2 in almost every way possible. Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.\\n\\nPros -\\nDisplay - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.\\n\\nAudio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvement\\n\\nAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nDisplay\\n\\nWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.\\n\\n1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.\\n\\n2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.\\n\\n3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.\\n\\n4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.\\n\\nComfort\\n\\nThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.\\n\\nEcosystem\\n\\nThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headset\\n\\nPassthrough\\n\\nThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR\\u00b9, thus far the native apps aren\\u2019t of interest] and didn\\u2019t use it as much as I\\u2019d expected.\\u00b2 With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I\\u2019ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2\\u2019s Fresnel lenses and the Q3\\u2019s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the \\u201csweet-spot\\u201d is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I\\u2019m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3f Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. \\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude10 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2\\u2019s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3\\u2019s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I\\u2019ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I\\u2019ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n\\u2022 battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n\\u2022 native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I\\u2019m sad there weren\\u2019t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it\\u2019s a still terrific bargain. It\\u2019s a shame about the contrast though \\ud83d\\ude39\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn\\u2019t have wifi enabled and couldn\\u2019t figure out why it wouldn\\u2019t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n\\u00b9 \\u2014 For PCVR I\\u2019m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta\\u2019s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I\\u2019ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I\\u2019ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop\\u2019s \\u201cHVEC 10-bit\\u201d encoder, which graphically is better than the plain \\u201cHVEC\\u201d encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n\\u00b2 \\u2014 Considering the price I paid vis-\\u00e0-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I've been in the VR game for a while now, going all the way back to the Oculus Rift dev kit 2 days. My other current headset is a Valve Index, and I mainly bought the Quest 3 with the intention of playing the Quest-exclusive games, fully expecting it to feel like a toy in comparison.\\n\\nIn practice, I'm in love with this thing. The displays are both high resolution and high quality, with little to no screendoor effect, and the tracking is impressively stable for something only being tracked by cameras and software. I thought the removal of the rings from the Q2 controllers would cause them to have more issues with occlusion, but I haven't noticed anything. Even the features I didn't know it had are pretty cool for the games that support them, like its mixed reality and controller-free hand tracking. But the thing that's really going to keep me away from my Index (at least for the games that aren't specifically tailored to it, like Half Life Alyx) is that I had no idea how much I needed to ditch the cable and play wirelessly until now. Being able to just walk around in my room without having to be aware of the cable behind me is such a nice feeling that it feels like I'm getting into VR for the first time again.\\n\\nWith that said, there are some small caveats -- namely, that this is not really a $500 headset. Meta has taken on a sort of Spirit Airlines approach, where the headset itself is affordably priced in exchange for other basic things being extremely expensive \\\"accessories\\\". The strap is the main offender, with the default one being the rough equivalent of just tying the headset to your head. They're happy to sell you a $60 strap, or a $130 one that extends the battery, though! And while you're at it you can blow $80 on a cable for linking it to your pc if you aren't a fan of wireless tethering, a $70 carrying case, a $40 silicone facial interface for extra comfort, a $130 charging dock to replace the controllers needing AA batteries, $40 hand straps for the controllers to give them Index-esque free-hand support... To be clear, most, if not all of these have off-brand counterparts that are just as good (or better!) for a fraction of the price, but my point is this is not a fully out of the box experience for those with more discerning tastes. For parents buying them for their younger children they'll probably be thrilled with it anyways, and can safely ignore all of that, but I would wager most adults will probably end up wanting at least a new head strap of some kind, whether it's the official one or not.\\n\\nIgnoring the troublesome accessories, though, this is an easy win as far as I'm concerned. The only real competition is that the Quest 2 is still holding its own as well from what I hear, and for prices that seem to be as low as they could possibly be around the holiday season. I can't speak first-hand on whether the Q3 is worth a $300 difference, but I can say I don't regret buying it. I held off on the Quest line of headsets because I've never been a big fan of Meta as a company, but I have to begrudgingly admit that this is probably the best vr headset at the best price you could get right now.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"The product arrived today, i recorded the opening and bootup.\\nNo dead pixels, passthrough works, there was a small issue with the nose piece not set but after looking it up it seems to be a common issue because of the way the VR opens/closes to adjust to face sizes.\\n\\nIf this occurs, gently push along the nose ridge and it will readjust itself as long as no lock-tab parts are actually damaged. I lucked out, as none of the tabs were broken and were able to go back into place.\\n\\nThe amazon box it came in again didn't have any protection what so ever. But the product itself was fine/stable in it's package box with appropriate padding.\\n\\nI had no issues getting it registered to meta, and grabbed a couple of free games that downloaded quickly enough. I haven't tried them, but I did explore the passthrough and nonpassthrough feature.\\n\\nVisual wise it's actually quite a bit more clear/crisp compared to the ps4 Vr(which is what I can compare it to). As it has a higher resolution/pixel count. I still haven't taken off the default stickers that protect the lenses until I can put on lense protectors. But even through all of the writing on the label that tells you NOT to use any form of liquid cleaners, even lense. It's visual is damn good.\\n\\nThe passthrough visual via camera is on par with a ps4 VR headset: and suffer's some glitches when it hits reflective surfaces but that is normal as camera's hate that extra reflection of light.. But interface/scenes are definitely more clear and crisp. Sound quality is good, not like being at a rock concert, but goes loud enough to enjoy. Headsets for sound actually aren't really needed for this VR.\\n\\nI haven't hooked it up to a computer yet, as it's suppose to be the 'big' gift for me and my fianc\\u00e9 to enjoy over Christmas. As it was a purchase done by the both of us - after calculating expenses..\\n\\nSo the big question: Is it worth the money?\\n\\nMy answer: Yes, I recommend going for the larger size because most of the games you will be downloading are often between 5-40gb.. With a few exceptions that could easily hit 80gb - example skyrim(haven't checked the store to see if that one is available on meta). Plus any mods one might want to add to the games.\\n\\nI was glad to see they had some of my more unique playstation favorites in their store. This made me happy, despite needing to buy it again. (Btw The Wizards* is excellent and lets you feel like your literally casting spells, or using a bow.)\\n\\nWith that said, go for the BIGGER hard drive: it will make it so your VR can hold more then 3 games without suffering quality issues. As you always want to leave room(1-5gb) for the OS(opperating system) to run smoothly. Then you won't have to worry about uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing cache/HD maintence every time you want to change your lineup.\\n\\n**For people with limited understanding of storage space 512GB should easily allow you to store 15-25games which if you have 'data' usage limits for whatever reason would avoid burn up of data by constantly downloading the same thing.\",\n",

I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \\\"rug burn\\\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone\\u2661\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Buy the Quest 3, DO NOT BUY THE QUEST 2. I still use my Quest 2 it's great but I don't care how cheap it is, the Quest 3 is that much better in both performance and visuals. Even games not updated still look and play smoother. The Quest 3 is good enough to get into VR gaming without a PC. The Quest 1 felt like a gimmick , the Quest 2 was good but still felt compromised but the Quest 3 (while obviously not as a good the average PCVR gaming pc) is able to get much closer and provide a PCVR like experience on newer games. Mixed reality was not something I was interested in but after trying it I think it's awesome, even if you consider it a gimmick it's very cool and fun tech. As someone who really only cared about PC based VR gaming I've been very impressed with the Quest 3. After going on a VR binge in 2019 and some of 2020 I've mostly only played VRChat now but because of the Quest 3 I started exploring VR games again trying out new and old games and even mixed reality stuff too. It's that good but I'd recommend an aftermarket headstrap. The included headstrap seems pretty bad but if you fiddle with it A LOT it can get comfy. Also I returned my 128GB model and bought the 512GB one. It should not cost that much more in price but honestly there's so much cool stuff and games are slowly getting bigger. If you have fast internet , you can buy the 128GB and be fine.\\n\\nThere's tons of amateur and professional unboxing videos of the Quest 3 that you can look at if you want to see what it looks like. As for what it's like to buy and own it? It's amazing.\\nBackground info: I've been a computer based VR player since 2017 when I got the original Oculus Rift also known as the CV1 on a Black Friday sale. Since then I've bought an Index in 2020 with vive trackers for full body tracking, a Quest 1 as a backup headset, a Quest 2 and now a Quest 3. I have about 6000 hours in VR 5000 of that is in VRChat.\\nReview: The Quest 3 is incredible. It's my first VR headset that uses pancake lens and it's beautiful. I dabbled in standalone gaming on my Quest 2 with games like Resident Evil 4 VR and Iron Man VR which were both great. Iron Man felt a little held back resolution wise with aggressive foveated rendering BUT THE Quest 3 fixes that mostly with higher resolution in literally everything. Everything from the interface to all old and new games feel snappy. I started playing mixed reality mini games like the Ghost Busters one and Synth Riders and the free built in Alien one and everything has been super cool. it's all surprisingly fun. Audio is also great, about as good as the Index. The whole thing feels more reliable though as my Index cable is annoying with how heavy and thick it is. I'm on my third cable in 3 years and still the Index needs to be unplugged sometimes to make it work. I've had no such problems on my Quest 2 and Quest 3. The only reason I still use my Index is for easy full body tracking in VRChat otherwise I play everything on my Quest 3.\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Update: Five Weeks Later\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else.\\n\\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they had made a lighter headset without the upgraded passthrough, but now passthrough is everything to me. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Eleven Table Tennis, and Meta Quest Browser for AR female hologram eye candy. One of the first AR games that I tried is a free game called First Encounters. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I might have bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I am sure that I will keep installed and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the default Quest 3 wall charger and link cable. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging the cord or the Quest 3 cable. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\\n\\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App lets you stream your PCVR games to your Quest headset, wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers. Virtual Desktop lets you have a virtual desktop in passthrough mode, but Immersed lets you too and in Immersed you can have up to four computer screens and you get to be around other users and their avatars. I still use Virtual Desktop for the head lock feature, which keeps the desktop screen in front of your face no matter what direction are are facing or where you move or walk to. I use it to read manhua while walking around the house for exercise. I am hoping that the headlock feature will be added to Immersed soon.\\n\\nResident Evil 4. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is VR or something but it truly is fun walking around in a realistic setting. I like the scenery better than Arizona Sunshine or The Walking Dead. The first Red Matter game was great, but sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value once you've completed the story. Green Hell looks really interesting. It's a realistic survival game. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game that is sorta interesting if co-op RPG games are your thing. It is a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. Genotype is a bit interesting. but the texture detail isn't as high as I would like.\\n\\nFor fitness, I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nI also suggest getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR). On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and mirror you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor in PCVR games. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \\\"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\\\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 65% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people to try the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much?\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \\\"pancake\\\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \\\"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\\\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \\\"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\\\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"There is no doubt this thing is superior to the Quest 2 in almost every way possible. Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.\\n\\nPros -\\nDisplay - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.\\n\\nAudio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvement\\n\\nAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nDisplay\\n\\nWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.\\n\\n1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.\\n\\n2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.\\n\\n3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.\\n\\n4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.\\n\\nComfort\\n\\nThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.\\n\\nEcosystem\\n\\nThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headset\\n\\nPassthrough\\n\\nThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR\\u00b9, thus far the native apps aren\\u2019t of interest] and didn\\u2019t use it as much as I\\u2019d expected.\\u00b2 With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I\\u2019ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2\\u2019s Fresnel lenses and the Q3\\u2019s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the \\u201csweet-spot\\u201d is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I\\u2019m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3f Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. \\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude10 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2\\u2019s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3\\u2019s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I\\u2019ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I\\u2019ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n\\u2022 battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n\\u2022 native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I\\u2019m sad there weren\\u2019t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it\\u2019s a still terrific bargain. It\\u2019s a shame about the contrast though \\ud83d\\ude39\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn\\u2019t have wifi enabled and couldn\\u2019t figure out why it wouldn\\u2019t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n\\u00b9 \\u2014 For PCVR I\\u2019m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta\\u2019s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I\\u2019ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I\\u2019ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop\\u2019s \\u201cHVEC 10-bit\\u201d encoder, which graphically is better than the plain \\u201cHVEC\\u201d encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n\\u00b2 \\u2014 Considering the price I paid vis-\\u00e0-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I've been in the VR game for a while now, going all the way back to the Oculus Rift dev kit 2 days. My other current headset is a Valve Index, and I mainly bought the Quest 3 with the intention of playing the Quest-exclusive games, fully expecting it to feel like a toy in comparison.\\n\\nIn practice, I'm in love with this thing. The displays are both high resolution and high quality, with little to no screendoor effect, and the tracking is impressively stable for something only being tracked by cameras and software. I thought the removal of the rings from the Q2 controllers would cause them to have more issues with occlusion, but I haven't noticed anything. Even the features I didn't know it had are pretty cool for the games that support them, like its mixed reality and controller-free hand tracking. But the thing that's really going to keep me away from my Index (at least for the games that aren't specifically tailored to it, like Half Life Alyx) is that I had no idea how much I needed to ditch the cable and play wirelessly until now. Being able to just walk around in my room without having to be aware of the cable behind me is such a nice feeling that it feels like I'm getting into VR for the first time again.\\n\\nWith that said, there are some small caveats -- namely, that this is not really a $500 headset. Meta has taken on a sort of Spirit Airlines approach, where the headset itself is affordably priced in exchange for other basic things being extremely expensive \\\"accessories\\\". The strap is the main offender, with the default one being the rough equivalent of just tying the headset to your head. They're happy to sell you a $60 strap, or a $130 one that extends the battery, though! And while you're at it you can blow $80 on a cable for linking it to your pc if you aren't a fan of wireless tethering, a $70 carrying case, a $40 silicone facial interface for extra comfort, a $130 charging dock to replace the controllers needing AA batteries, $40 hand straps for the controllers to give them Index-esque free-hand support... To be clear, most, if not all of these have off-brand counterparts that are just as good (or better!) for a fraction of the price, but my point is this is not a fully out of the box experience for those with more discerning tastes. For parents buying them for their younger children they'll probably be thrilled with it anyways, and can safely ignore all of that, but I would wager most adults will probably end up wanting at least a new head strap of some kind, whether it's the official one or not.\\n\\nIgnoring the troublesome accessories, though, this is an easy win as far as I'm concerned. The only real competition is that the Quest 2 is still holding its own as well from what I hear, and for prices that seem to be as low as they could possibly be around the holiday season. I can't speak first-hand on whether the Q3 is worth a $300 difference, but I can say I don't regret buying it. I held off on the Quest line of headsets because I've never been a big fan of Meta as a company, but I have to begrudgingly admit that this is probably the best vr headset at the best price you could get right now.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"The product arrived today, i recorded the opening and bootup.\\nNo dead pixels, passthrough works, there was a small issue with the nose piece not set but after looking it up it seems to be a common issue because of the way the VR opens/closes to adjust to face sizes.\\n\\nIf this occurs, gently push along the nose ridge and it will readjust itself as long as no lock-tab parts are actually damaged. I lucked out, as none of the tabs were broken and were able to go back into place.\\n\\nThe amazon box it came in again didn't have any protection what so ever. But the product itself was fine/stable in it's package box with appropriate padding.\\n\\nI had no issues getting it registered to meta, and grabbed a couple of free games that downloaded quickly enough. I haven't tried them, but I did explore the passthrough and nonpassthrough feature.\\n\\nVisual wise it's actually quite a bit more clear/crisp compared to the ps4 Vr(which is what I can compare it to). As it has a higher resolution/pixel count. I still haven't taken off the default stickers that protect the lenses until I can put on lense protectors. But even through all of the writing on the label that tells you NOT to use any form of liquid cleaners, even lense. It's visual is damn good.\\n\\nThe passthrough visual via camera is on par with a ps4 VR headset: and suffer's some glitches when it hits reflective surfaces but that is normal as camera's hate that extra reflection of light.. But interface/scenes are definitely more clear and crisp. Sound quality is good, not like being at a rock concert, but goes loud enough to enjoy. Headsets for sound actually aren't really needed for this VR.\\n\\nI haven't hooked it up to a computer yet, as it's suppose to be the 'big' gift for me and my fianc\\u00e9 to enjoy over Christmas. As it was a purchase done by the both of us - after calculating expenses..\\n\\nSo the big question: Is it worth the money?\\n\\nMy answer: Yes, I recommend going for the larger size because most of the games you will be downloading are often between 5-40gb.. With a few exceptions that could easily hit 80gb - example skyrim(haven't checked the store to see if that one is available on meta). Plus any mods one might want to add to the games.\\n\\nI was glad to see they had some of my more unique playstation favorites in their store. This made me happy, despite needing to buy it again. (Btw The Wizards* is excellent and lets you feel like your literally casting spells, or using a bow.)\\n\\nWith that said, go for the BIGGER hard drive: it will make it so your VR can hold more then 3 games without suffering quality issues. As you always want to leave room(1-5gb) for the OS(opperating system) to run smoothly. Then you won't have to worry about uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing cache/HD maintence every time you want to change your lineup.\\n\\n**For people with limited understanding of storage space 512GB should easily allow you to store 15-25games which if you have 'data' usage limits for whatever reason would avoid burn up of data by constantly downloading the same thing.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \\\"rug burn\\\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone\\u2661\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Buy the Quest 3, DO NOT BUY THE QUEST 2. I still use my Quest 2 it's great but I don't care how cheap it is, the Quest 3 is that much better in both performance and visuals. Even games not updated still look and play smoother. The Quest 3 is good enough to get into VR gaming without a PC. The Quest 1 felt like a gimmick , the Quest 2 was good but still felt compromised but the Quest 3 (while obviously not as a good the average PCVR gaming pc) is able to get much closer and provide a PCVR like experience on newer games. Mixed reality was not something I was interested in but after trying it I think it's awesome, even if you consider it a gimmick it's very cool and fun tech. As someone who really only cared about PC based VR gaming I've been very impressed with the Quest 3. After going on a VR binge in 2019 and some of 2020 I've mostly only played VRChat now but because of the Quest 3 I started exploring VR games again trying out new and old games and even mixed reality stuff too. It's that good but I'd recommend an aftermarket headstrap. The included headstrap seems pretty bad but if you fiddle with it A LOT it can get comfy. Also I returned my 128GB model and bought the 512GB one. It should not cost that much more in price but honestly there's so much cool stuff and games are slowly getting bigger. If you have fast internet , you can buy the 128GB and be fine.\\n\\nThere's tons of amateur and professional unboxing videos of the Quest 3 that you can look at if you want to see what it looks like. As for what it's like to buy and own it? It's amazing.\\nBackground info: I've been a computer based VR player since 2017 when I got the original Oculus Rift also known as the CV1 on a Black Friday sale. Since then I've bought an Index in 2020 with vive trackers for full body tracking, a Quest 1 as a backup headset, a Quest 2 and now a Quest 3. I have about 6000 hours in VR 5000 of that is in VRChat.\\nReview: The Quest 3 is incredible. It's my first VR headset that uses pancake lens and it's beautiful. I dabbled in standalone gaming on my Quest 2 with games like Resident Evil 4 VR and Iron Man VR which were both great. Iron Man felt a little held back resolution wise with aggressive foveated rendering BUT THE Quest 3 fixes that mostly with higher resolution in literally everything. Everything from the interface to all old and new games feel snappy. I started playing mixed reality mini games like the Ghost Busters one and Synth Riders and the free built in Alien one and everything has been super cool. it's all surprisingly fun. Audio is also great, about as good as the Index. The whole thing feels more reliable though as my Index cable is annoying with how heavy and thick it is. I'm on my third cable in 3 years and still the Index needs to be unplugged sometimes to make it work. I've had no such problems on my Quest 2 and Quest 3. The only reason I still use my Index is for easy full body tracking in VRChat otherwise I play everything on my Quest 3.\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Update: Five Weeks Later\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else.\\n\\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they had made a lighter headset without the upgraded passthrough, but now passthrough is everything to me. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Eleven Table Tennis, and Meta Quest Browser for AR female hologram eye candy. One of the first AR games that I tried is a free game called First Encounters. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I might have bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I am sure that I will keep installed and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the default Quest 3 wall charger and link cable. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging the cord or the Quest 3 cable. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\\n\\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App lets you stream your PCVR games to your Quest headset, wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers. Virtual Desktop lets you have a virtual desktop in passthrough mode, but Immersed lets you too and in Immersed you can have up to four computer screens and you get to be around other users and their avatars. I still use Virtual Desktop for the head lock feature, which keeps the desktop screen in front of your face no matter what direction are are facing or where you move or walk to. I use it to read manhua while walking around the house for exercise. I am hoping that the headlock feature will be added to Immersed soon.\\n\\nResident Evil 4. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is VR or something but it truly is fun walking around in a realistic setting. I like the scenery better than Arizona Sunshine or The Walking Dead. The first Red Matter game was great, but sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value once you've completed the story. Green Hell looks really interesting. It's a realistic survival game. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game that is sorta interesting if co-op RPG games are your thing. It is a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. Genotype is a bit interesting. but the texture detail isn't as high as I would like.\\n\\nFor fitness, I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nI also suggest getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR). On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and mirror you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor in PCVR games. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \\\"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\\\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 65% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people to try the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much?\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \\\"pancake\\\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \\\"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\\\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \\\"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\\\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"There is no doubt this thing is superior to the Quest 2 in almost every way possible. Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.\\n\\nPros -\\nDisplay - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.\\n\\nAudio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvement\\n\\nAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nDisplay\\n\\nWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.\\n\\n1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.\\n\\n2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.\\n\\n3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.\\n\\n4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.\\n\\nComfort\\n\\nThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.\\n\\nEcosystem\\n\\nThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headset\\n\\nPassthrough\\n\\nThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR\\u00b9, thus far the native apps aren\\u2019t of interest] and didn\\u2019t use it as much as I\\u2019d expected.\\u00b2 With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I\\u2019ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2\\u2019s Fresnel lenses and the Q3\\u2019s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the \\u201csweet-spot\\u201d is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I\\u2019m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3f Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. \\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude10 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2\\u2019s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3\\u2019s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I\\u2019ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I\\u2019ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n\\u2022 battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n\\u2022 native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I\\u2019m sad there weren\\u2019t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it\\u2019s a still terrific bargain. It\\u2019s a shame about the contrast though \\ud83d\\ude39\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn\\u2019t have wifi enabled and couldn\\u2019t figure out why it wouldn\\u2019t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n\\u00b9 \\u2014 For PCVR I\\u2019m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta\\u2019s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I\\u2019ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I\\u2019ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop\\u2019s \\u201cHVEC 10-bit\\u201d encoder, which graphically is better than the plain \\u201cHVEC\\u201d encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n\\u00b2 \\u2014 Considering the price I paid vis-\\u00e0-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I've been in the VR game for a while now, going all the way back to the Oculus Rift dev kit 2 days. My other current headset is a Valve Index, and I mainly bought the Quest 3 with the intention of playing the Quest-exclusive games, fully expecting it to feel like a toy in comparison.\\n\\nIn practice, I'm in love with this thing. The displays are both high resolution and high quality, with little to no screendoor effect, and the tracking is impressively stable for something only being tracked by cameras and software. I thought the removal of the rings from the Q2 controllers would cause them to have more issues with occlusion, but I haven't noticed anything. Even the features I didn't know it had are pretty cool for the games that support them, like its mixed reality and controller-free hand tracking. But the thing that's really going to keep me away from my Index (at least for the games that aren't specifically tailored to it, like Half Life Alyx) is that I had no idea how much I needed to ditch the cable and play wirelessly until now. Being able to just walk around in my room without having to be aware of the cable behind me is such a nice feeling that it feels like I'm getting into VR for the first time again.\\n\\nWith that said, there are some small caveats -- namely, that this is not really a $500 headset. Meta has taken on a sort of Spirit Airlines approach, where the headset itself is affordably priced in exchange for other basic things being extremely expensive \\\"accessories\\\". The strap is the main offender, with the default one being the rough equivalent of just tying the headset to your head. They're happy to sell you a $60 strap, or a $130 one that extends the battery, though! And while you're at it you can blow $80 on a cable for linking it to your pc if you aren't a fan of wireless tethering, a $70 carrying case, a $40 silicone facial interface for extra comfort, a $130 charging dock to replace the controllers needing AA batteries, $40 hand straps for the controllers to give them Index-esque free-hand support... To be clear, most, if not all of these have off-brand counterparts that are just as good (or better!) for a fraction of the price, but my point is this is not a fully out of the box experience for those with more discerning tastes. For parents buying them for their younger children they'll probably be thrilled with it anyways, and can safely ignore all of that, but I would wager most adults will probably end up wanting at least a new head strap of some kind, whether it's the official one or not.\\n\\nIgnoring the troublesome accessories, though, this is an easy win as far as I'm concerned. The only real competition is that the Quest 2 is still holding its own as well from what I hear, and for prices that seem to be as low as they could possibly be around the holiday season. I can't speak first-hand on whether the Q3 is worth a $300 difference, but I can say I don't regret buying it. I held off on the Quest line of headsets because I've never been a big fan of Meta as a company, but I have to begrudgingly admit that this is probably the best vr headset at the best price you could get right now.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"The product arrived today, i recorded the opening and bootup.\\nNo dead pixels, passthrough works, there was a small issue with the nose piece not set but after looking it up it seems to be a common issue because of the way the VR opens/closes to adjust to face sizes.\\n\\nIf this occurs, gently push along the nose ridge and it will readjust itself as long as no lock-tab parts are actually damaged. I lucked out, as none of the tabs were broken and were able to go back into place.\\n\\nThe amazon box it came in again didn't have any protection what so ever. But the product itself was fine/stable in it's package box with appropriate padding.\\n\\nI had no issues getting it registered to meta, and grabbed a couple of free games that downloaded quickly enough. I haven't tried them, but I did explore the passthrough and nonpassthrough feature.\\n\\nVisual wise it's actually quite a bit more clear/crisp compared to the ps4 Vr(which is what I can compare it to). As it has a higher resolution/pixel count. I still haven't taken off the default stickers that protect the lenses until I can put on lense protectors. But even through all of the writing on the label that tells you NOT to use any form of liquid cleaners, even lense. It's visual is damn good.\\n\\nThe passthrough visual via camera is on par with a ps4 VR headset: and suffer's some glitches when it hits reflective surfaces but that is normal as camera's hate that extra reflection of light.. But interface/scenes are definitely more clear and crisp. Sound quality is good, not like being at a rock concert, but goes loud enough to enjoy. Headsets for sound actually aren't really needed for this VR.\\n\\nI haven't hooked it up to a computer yet, as it's suppose to be the 'big' gift for me and my fianc\\u00e9 to enjoy over Christmas. As it was a purchase done by the both of us - after calculating expenses..\\n\\nSo the big question: Is it worth the money?\\n\\nMy answer: Yes, I recommend going for the larger size because most of the games you will be downloading are often between 5-40gb.. With a few exceptions that could easily hit 80gb - example skyrim(haven't checked the store to see if that one is available on meta). Plus any mods one might want to add to the games.\\n\\nI was glad to see they had some of my more unique playstation favorites in their store. This made me happy, despite needing to buy it again. (Btw The Wizards* is excellent and lets you feel like your literally casting spells, or using a bow.)\\n\\nWith that said, go for the BIGGER hard drive: it will make it so your VR can hold more then 3 games without suffering quality issues. As you always want to leave room(1-5gb) for the OS(opperating system) to run smoothly. Then you won't have to worry about uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing cache/HD maintence every time you want to change your lineup.\\n\\n**For people with limited understanding of storage space 512GB should easily allow you to store 15-25games which if you have 'data' usage limits for whatever reason would avoid burn up of data by constantly downloading the same thing.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \\\"rug burn\\\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone\\u2661\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Buy the Quest 3, DO NOT BUY THE QUEST 2. I still use my Quest 2 it's great but I don't care how cheap it is, the Quest 3 is that much better in both performance and visuals. Even games not updated still look and play smoother. The Quest 3 is good enough to get into VR gaming without a PC. The Quest 1 felt like a gimmick , the Quest 2 was good but still felt compromised but the Quest 3 (while obviously not as a good the average PCVR gaming pc) is able to get much closer and provide a PCVR like experience on newer games. Mixed reality was not something I was interested in but after trying it I think it's awesome, even if you consider it a gimmick it's very cool and fun tech. As someone who really only cared about PC based VR gaming I've been very impressed with the Quest 3. After going on a VR binge in 2019 and some of 2020 I've mostly only played VRChat now but because of the Quest 3 I started exploring VR games again trying out new and old games and even mixed reality stuff too. It's that good but I'd recommend an aftermarket headstrap. The included headstrap seems pretty bad but if you fiddle with it A LOT it can get comfy. Also I returned my 128GB model and bought the 512GB one. It should not cost that much more in price but honestly there's so much cool stuff and games are slowly getting bigger. If you have fast internet , you can buy the 128GB and be fine.\\n\\nThere's tons of amateur and professional unboxing videos of the Quest 3 that you can look at if you want to see what it looks like. As for what it's like to buy and own it? It's amazing.\\nBackground info: I've been a computer based VR player since 2017 when I got the original Oculus Rift also known as the CV1 on a Black Friday sale. Since then I've bought an Index in 2020 with vive trackers for full body tracking, a Quest 1 as a backup headset, a Quest 2 and now a Quest 3. I have about 6000 hours in VR 5000 of that is in VRChat.\\nReview: The Quest 3 is incredible. It's my first VR headset that uses pancake lens and it's beautiful. I dabbled in standalone gaming on my Quest 2 with games like Resident Evil 4 VR and Iron Man VR which were both great. Iron Man felt a little held back resolution wise with aggressive foveated rendering BUT THE Quest 3 fixes that mostly with higher resolution in literally everything. Everything from the interface to all old and new games feel snappy. I started playing mixed reality mini games like the Ghost Busters one and Synth Riders and the free built in Alien one and everything has been super cool. it's all surprisingly fun. Audio is also great, about as good as the Index. The whole thing feels more reliable though as my Index cable is annoying with how heavy and thick it is. I'm on my third cable in 3 years and still the Index needs to be unplugged sometimes to make it work. I've had no such problems on my Quest 2 and Quest 3. The only reason I still use my Index is for easy full body tracking in VRChat otherwise I play everything on my Quest 3.\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Update: Six Weeks Later (Some Helpful Tips and Some Edits)\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else. But I pretty much never feel any discomfort at all.\\n\\nWhen adjusting the headset for the first time, the top strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be resting on your head. The most important adjustment is the headset arms because it determines how clear your vision will be. You want to adjust the the top strap and position of the headset interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. Then lastly, the back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I have mine pretty snug but there is no discomfort. For those who ever experience discomfort, it's probably because their headset arms are not at a good angle which causes all the pressure of the headset to be on the forehead which goes numb because of lack of blood flow.\\n\\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn't upgrade it, because I thought that it would make the headset lighter if they didn't upgrade it and I was worried about how heavy and uncomfortable the Quest 3 would be. But it's not at all heavy and it's very comfortable. Also, passthrough is everything to me now. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Eleven Table Tennis, and the Meta Quest Browser (for female hologram eye candy). Three is a free AR game called First Encounters that was fun to try and which I play on rare occasions. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have probably bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I want to keep installed for a while and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps like Virtual Desktop and Immersed when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general. I use it for when I am walking and indoor biking and sometimes when doing exercises like pushups and hamstring stretches.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the Quest 3 wall charger and link cable that comes with the headset. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like only half an hour (or more).\\n\\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers since my router isn't that great.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI like using Virtual Desktop for the virtual desktop. It's easy to grab and move the desktop around. It has a headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it lets you use your Quest controller to scroll and click on things. And it works in passthrough mode. I also like Immersed because you can have up to four virtual computer screens for free (five if you log in three times a week or pay for premium). Immersed allows you to be around other users and their avatars and it also has a passthrough mode. The only bad thing about Immersed is that it's not as easy to tilt and move the virtual desktop screens around, there is no headlock, and the Quest controllers are pretty much useless when interacting with the computer screens.\\n\\nZombie Games.... I started a game called Propagation: Paradise Hotel and it's a lot of fun and very interesting. Resident Evil 4 is also a good zombie VR game. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is a VR game or something but RE4 is fun to play. I like walking around the realistic setting. I like the scenery in RE4 better than the scenery in Arizona Sunshine and The Walking Dead. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners is also a decent zombie game. It's a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in TWD: S&S.\\n\\nOther Games.... I really liked the first Red Matter game. It was awesome. But sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value. I'm playing Red Matter 2, but so far I don't find it interesting. Genotype is a somewhat interesting game, but I feel like the texture resolutions aren't so great. Green Hell is an interesting realistic survival game so that is worth a try too. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game with crafting and you can even fish. I joined a Survival Nation server once and some guy came charging towards me and then started doing a lot of sign language, trying to get me to turn voice on, and trying to get me to complete 20 things at once so that I could be quickly caught up and start co-op'ng with him. That made me feel uncomfortable so then I started playing on solo mode. But after a while I got bored with solo mode. I want to be on the same server as other people but not feel pressured to co-op with them. I uninstalled it for now, but I might come back to it soon.\\n\\nFitness Games... I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nCustom Launchers... I recommend getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher to help organize your games, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR games). (Increasing the resolution of games and your CPU/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, which isn't a problem for me since I am using an extension cord.) On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and the mirror that you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \\\"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\\\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems. I mean some games are unbearably laggy and unplayable, but other games are playable. The important thing is that PCVR is an option for me and works most of the time, even though I have a weak laptop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 70% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people from trying the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much? I'm already looking forward to the Quest 4 because I hope it will have even better passthrough and better resolution.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\\n\\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\\n\\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\\n\\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\\n\\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\\n\\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\\n\\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\\n\\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\\n\\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\\n\\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\\n\\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Simply put I was blown away by the technology. The visuals are generally sharp and crisp and are pretty mind blowing. Even just navigating the menu screens is a joy, and the fact that it registers hand input is insane. The controllers feel good and snappy and intuitive.\\n\\nBut the apps just still aren't there overall. The selection of games is still just not quite there to justify this to 'everybody', and it is still far too hard to do simple things like play 3D movies or easily navigate the web to make this a must recommend. It is also still relatively heavy on the face (though improved from previous generations). The battery life is short at 2 hours but you probably won't want to play for that long anyway given the above. The pass through is.. passable but you won't be wanting to read any screens through it and it is definitely grainy. It is also unfathomable to me why they chose to ship this without a nasal piece to block the light coming in from the bottom.\\n\\nIn short, it's the best to come so far and this tech is definitely the future, but the technology still has quite a ways to go.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"First off, I'll say that i just got this and am still testing. But so far, I am super impressed. I own an original vive that I bought day 1 and then i got a reverb g2 that I have been using until the quest 3. Both if my previous headsets were corded, limited to one area of the house, and a pain to setup and use when I wanted to play. I was using light houses as well on the reverb g2 so that I could still use my better tracking vive wands. All of it was limiting and a pain which made me end up not playing. The Quest 3 was the solution I had been waiting for!\\n\\nBeing able to do room setup in headset quick and easy is a dream come true. I was skeptical about the wireless capability for pcvr as well but I am blown away at how well it has worked so far. I've been able to play pcvr games anywhere in my house which is amazing.\\n\\nThe pancake lenses are so much better than the fresnek lenses also. I wear glasses, and the quest 3 works well with my glasses out of the box, although I do want to get some lens inserts later.\\n\\nEverything seems very polished with a minimal amount of bugs. The AR pass through which it is somewhat grainy and not super clear, it's fun and works very well. The sound is pretty amazing also for the type do speakers it has.. Not enough bass in beatsaber and it can't compare to the g2 style of speakers but very impressive for what they are.\\n\\nControllers feel nice and not cheap, track well, battery life on the controllers is good. The headset itself looks and feels pretty good. I think they should have put a nose flap on it because the only place I have lightleak is at the bottom of the nose area. The strap of course is everyone's gripe.. Yes, it isn't great.. But tbh it isn't as uncomfortable as what everyone keeps saying to me. It works but it just isn't the best.\\n\\nMy one issue, aside from this being released by a company I don't like, is that they want to nickle and dime everyone for things that they should have included with the headset or to fix issues with the headset.\\n\\nThe headset battery life is about 2 hours. That isn't long... So they sell an overpriced better elite headstrap with an extra battery to extend it to 4 hours I think. Fixes two issues by making you pay more money. Fortunately, there are plenty of aftermarket options for battery extenders and straps that are cheaper, so you don't have to spend more money on meta's overpriced accessories.\\n\\nI've seen reports of people getting headsets with dead pixels and there being quality control issues... So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels.. Im a stickler for that stuff cause my vive had a dead pixel and it always bothered me. I'll be checking closely to make sure the quest 3 is good.\\n\\nI was going to take one star off for meta nickle and diming but the headset is so good that I won't do that as of now. This may change later but it's simply the best, most versatile, most polished VR headset you can get right now for this price. I guess they kept the price down by giving a crappy strap, smaller battery, etc.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I bought the Quest 2 when it came out and was disappointed with the difficulty to maintain a good focus through both eyes, the wear on my face even after short-term use, the battery life, the overall performance (freezing, hitching , and delays while doing simple things was common), and the general lack of 3rd party support. The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don't accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn't randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!\\n\\nIt's still not perfect, and here's the bad so far:\\n- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.\\n- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you're really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn't ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.\\n- I've heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I've played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there's still no dedicated app) with no issues.\\n- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \\\"competitor\\\" platforms and services.\\n- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it's clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn't normally a sudden change in color/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.\\n- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.\\n\\nIf you're still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it's still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\\n\\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\\n\\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\\n\\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\\n\\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \\\"rug burn\\\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone\\u2661\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \\\"pancake\\\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \\\"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\\\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \\\"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\\\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR\\u00b9, thus far the native apps aren\\u2019t of interest] and didn\\u2019t use it as much as I\\u2019d expected.\\u00b2 With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I\\u2019ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2\\u2019s Fresnel lenses and the Q3\\u2019s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the \\u201csweet-spot\\u201d is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I\\u2019m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3f Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. \\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude10 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2\\u2019s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3\\u2019s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I\\u2019ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I\\u2019ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n\\u2022 battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n\\u2022 native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I\\u2019m sad there weren\\u2019t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it\\u2019s a still terrific bargain. It\\u2019s a shame about the contrast though \\ud83d\\ude39\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn\\u2019t have wifi enabled and couldn\\u2019t figure out why it wouldn\\u2019t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n\\u00b9 \\u2014 For PCVR I\\u2019m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta\\u2019s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I\\u2019ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I\\u2019ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop\\u2019s \\u201cHVEC 10-bit\\u201d encoder, which graphically is better than the plain \\u201cHVEC\\u201d encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n\\u00b2 \\u2014 Considering the price I paid vis-\\u00e0-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Update: Six Weeks Later (Some Helpful Tips and Some Edits)\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else. But I pretty much never feel any discomfort at all.\\n\\nWhen adjusting the headset for the first time, the top strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be resting on your head. The most important adjustment is the headset arms because it determines how clear your vision will be. You want to adjust the the top strap and position of the headset interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. Then lastly, the back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I have mine pretty snug but there is no discomfort. For those who ever experience discomfort, it's probably because their headset arms are not at a good angle which causes all the pressure of the headset to be on the forehead which goes numb because of lack of blood flow.\\n\\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn't upgrade it, because I thought that it would make the headset lighter if they didn't upgrade it and I was worried about how heavy and uncomfortable the Quest 3 would be. But it's not at all heavy and it's very comfortable. Also, passthrough is everything to me now. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Eleven Table Tennis, and the Meta Quest Browser (for female hologram eye candy). Three is a free AR game called First Encounters that was fun to try and which I play on rare occasions. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have probably bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I want to keep installed for a while and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps like Virtual Desktop and Immersed when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general. I use it for when I am walking and indoor biking and sometimes when doing exercises like pushups and hamstring stretches.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the Quest 3 wall charger and link cable that comes with the headset. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like only half an hour (or more).\\n\\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers since my router isn't that great.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI like using Virtual Desktop for the virtual desktop. It's easy to grab and move the desktop around. It has a headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it lets you use your Quest controller to scroll and click on things. And it works in passthrough mode. I also like Immersed because you can have up to four virtual computer screens for free (five if you log in three times a week or pay for premium). Immersed allows you to be around other users and their avatars and it also has a passthrough mode. The only bad thing about Immersed is that it's not as easy to tilt and move the virtual desktop screens around, there is no headlock, and the Quest controllers are pretty much useless when interacting with the computer screens.\\n\\nZombie Games.... I started a game called Propagation: Paradise Hotel and it's a lot of fun and very interesting. Resident Evil 4 is also a good zombie VR game. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is a VR game or something but RE4 is fun to play. I like walking around the realistic setting. I like the scenery in RE4 better than the scenery in Arizona Sunshine and The Walking Dead. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners is also a decent zombie game. It's a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in TWD: S&S.\\n\\nOther Games.... I really liked the first Red Matter game. It was awesome. But sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value. I'm playing Red Matter 2, but so far I don't find it interesting. Genotype is a somewhat interesting game, but I feel like the texture resolutions aren't so great. Green Hell is an interesting realistic survival game so that is worth a try too. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game with crafting and you can even fish. I joined a Survival Nation server once and some guy came charging towards me and then started doing a lot of sign language, trying to get me to turn voice on, and trying to get me to complete 20 things at once so that I could be quickly caught up and start co-op'ng with him. That made me feel uncomfortable so then I started playing on solo mode. But after a while I got bored with solo mode. I want to be on the same server as other people but not feel pressured to co-op with them. I uninstalled it for now, but I might come back to it soon.\\n\\nFitness Games... I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nCustom Launchers... I recommend getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher to help organize your games, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR games). (Increasing the resolution of games and your CPU/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, which isn't a problem for me since I am using an extension cord.) On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and the mirror that you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \\\"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\\\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems. I mean some games are unbearably laggy and unplayable, but other games are playable. The important thing is that PCVR is an option for me and works most of the time, even though I have a weak laptop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 70% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people from trying the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much? I'm already looking forward to the Quest 4 because I hope it will have even better passthrough and better resolution.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\\n\\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\\n\\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\\n\\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\\n\\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\\n\\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\\n\\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\\n\\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\\n\\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\\n\\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\\n\\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Simply put I was blown away by the technology. The visuals are generally sharp and crisp and are pretty mind blowing. Even just navigating the menu screens is a joy, and the fact that it registers hand input is insane. The controllers feel good and snappy and intuitive.\\n\\nBut the apps just still aren't there overall. The selection of games is still just not quite there to justify this to 'everybody', and it is still far too hard to do simple things like play 3D movies or easily navigate the web to make this a must recommend. It is also still relatively heavy on the face (though improved from previous generations). The battery life is short at 2 hours but you probably won't want to play for that long anyway given the above. The pass through is.. passable but you won't be wanting to read any screens through it and it is definitely grainy. It is also unfathomable to me why they chose to ship this without a nasal piece to block the light coming in from the bottom.\\n\\nIn short, it's the best to come so far and this tech is definitely the future, but the technology still has quite a ways to go.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"First off, I'll say that i just got this and am still testing. But so far, I am super impressed. I own an original vive that I bought day 1 and then i got a reverb g2 that I have been using until the quest 3. Both if my previous headsets were corded, limited to one area of the house, and a pain to setup and use when I wanted to play. I was using light houses as well on the reverb g2 so that I could still use my better tracking vive wands. All of it was limiting and a pain which made me end up not playing. The Quest 3 was the solution I had been waiting for!\\n\\nBeing able to do room setup in headset quick and easy is a dream come true. I was skeptical about the wireless capability for pcvr as well but I am blown away at how well it has worked so far. I've been able to play pcvr games anywhere in my house which is amazing.\\n\\nThe pancake lenses are so much better than the fresnek lenses also. I wear glasses, and the quest 3 works well with my glasses out of the box, although I do want to get some lens inserts later.\\n\\nEverything seems very polished with a minimal amount of bugs. The AR pass through which it is somewhat grainy and not super clear, it's fun and works very well. The sound is pretty amazing also for the type do speakers it has.. Not enough bass in beatsaber and it can't compare to the g2 style of speakers but very impressive for what they are.\\n\\nControllers feel nice and not cheap, track well, battery life on the controllers is good. The headset itself looks and feels pretty good. I think they should have put a nose flap on it because the only place I have lightleak is at the bottom of the nose area. The strap of course is everyone's gripe.. Yes, it isn't great.. But tbh it isn't as uncomfortable as what everyone keeps saying to me. It works but it just isn't the best.\\n\\nMy one issue, aside from this being released by a company I don't like, is that they want to nickle and dime everyone for things that they should have included with the headset or to fix issues with the headset.\\n\\nThe headset battery life is about 2 hours. That isn't long... So they sell an overpriced better elite headstrap with an extra battery to extend it to 4 hours I think. Fixes two issues by making you pay more money. Fortunately, there are plenty of aftermarket options for battery extenders and straps that are cheaper, so you don't have to spend more money on meta's overpriced accessories.\\n\\nI've seen reports of people getting headsets with dead pixels and there being quality control issues... So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels.. Im a stickler for that stuff cause my vive had a dead pixel and it always bothered me. I'll be checking closely to make sure the quest 3 is good.\\n\\nI was going to take one star off for meta nickle and diming but the headset is so good that I won't do that as of now. This may change later but it's simply the best, most versatile, most polished VR headset you can get right now for this price. I guess they kept the price down by giving a crappy strap, smaller battery, etc.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I bought the Quest 2 when it came out and was disappointed with the difficulty to maintain a good focus through both eyes, the wear on my face even after short-term use, the battery life, the overall performance (freezing, hitching , and delays while doing simple things was common), and the general lack of 3rd party support. The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don't accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn't randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!\\n\\nIt's still not perfect, and here's the bad so far:\\n- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.\\n- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you're really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn't ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.\\n- I've heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I've played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there's still no dedicated app) with no issues.\\n- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \\\"competitor\\\" platforms and services.\\n- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it's clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn't normally a sudden change in color/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.\\n- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.\\n\\nIf you're still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it's still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\\n\\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\\n\\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\\n\\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\\n\\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \\\"rug burn\\\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone\\u2661\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \\\"pancake\\\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \\\"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\\\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \\\"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\\\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR\\u00b9, thus far the native apps aren\\u2019t of interest] and didn\\u2019t use it as much as I\\u2019d expected.\\u00b2 With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I\\u2019ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2\\u2019s Fresnel lenses and the Q3\\u2019s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the \\u201csweet-spot\\u201d is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I\\u2019m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3f Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. \\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude10 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2\\u2019s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3\\u2019s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I\\u2019ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I\\u2019ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n\\u2022 battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n\\u2022 native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I\\u2019m sad there weren\\u2019t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it\\u2019s a still terrific bargain. It\\u2019s a shame about the contrast though \\ud83d\\ude39\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn\\u2019t have wifi enabled and couldn\\u2019t figure out why it wouldn\\u2019t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n\\u00b9 \\u2014 For PCVR I\\u2019m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta\\u2019s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I\\u2019ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I\\u2019ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop\\u2019s \\u201cHVEC 10-bit\\u201d encoder, which graphically is better than the plain \\u201cHVEC\\u201d encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n\\u00b2 \\u2014 Considering the price I paid vis-\\u00e0-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\"\n",

            "            \"1\": \"First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.\",\n",
            "            \"2\": \"I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\\n\\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\\n\\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\\n\\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\\n\\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\\n\\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\\n\\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.\",\n",

            "            \"5\": \"This is an entry level VR headset and it's excellent for its price. I love it. There are quirks with it. Please mind that it was introduced to the market in late 2020 (so 3 years ago from this review) which is eons ago in tech space, so it's getting old, but I still love it.\\n\\nYes it's heavy, yes it works best when connected with a USB cable (for high FPS use), yes it's a little irritating to use generally because when in VR you have to interact with the world around you. So there's the learning curve. You need to invest time using this VR headset before submitting a review because things in VR are disorienting at the beginning -- think like the first time you used a trackball or a mouse.. took time to master.\\n\\nThat being said, I use it primarily for sim racing, it's comfortable, and it's absolutely incredible, so much that once you have the straps figured out properly and worked out the kinks, you can't tell it's even there. The sound that comes out of it is very immersive and good, the field of vision is excellent (I have one bad eye and I see 20/20 with the headset), I love the experience so much that I stopped using other sim racing games that don't support VR. I spend a lot of time on real race tracks in real life, and this VR headset allows me to spend time on the race track when it's raining out or when the season is over.\\n\\nBuy it, you won't regret it\",\n",
            "            \"6\": \"I have absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this headset. It's fun and the fact that someone on my budget could afford it is really something. I wouldn't have had a VR set if it weren't for this being as affordable as it is. There are some shortcuts clearly taken to help keep it affordable but the actual VR hardware is amazing. Visuals are clear and immersive and it keeps up with my movements very well. If you don't have the money for something like an Index or Vive but want VR this is a great choice. It's also pretty sturdy. I've punched my table so hard my knuckles bled and the controller barely had a mark on it. You also can't tell I've headbutted my desk multiple times trying to pick up guns and rotwiener cores lol.\\n\\nLets get complaints out of the way first:\\n\\u2022 The original strap the headset came with is 100% the absolute worst part of the headset.\\nDo yourself a favor and snag the Kiwi Design head strap while you're here on Amazon. The original strap squeezed the heck out of my head and if I loosened it the headset could flop around a bit causing blurry graphics and just being uncomfortable for a different reason. Due to that constant squeeze it gave me some nasty headaches usually after 2-3 hours of gameplay but sometimes much sooner and they could last the rest of the day. While they're nothing compared to a cluster headache for pain they were still what I'd consider bad.\\n\\u2022 Air link was awesome and worked great but was broken within a week of receiving the headset likely due to a patch (0.37 I think).\\nI didn't get to enjoy it and the only potential bit of troubleshooting I have left to try as far as I've found is a factory reset which I'm reluctant to do. I bought a 3rd party link cable which is working well enough for me but I'd really like to be able to take my gaming to my living room where I have much less risk of punching or breaking anything and have some room to physically move around.\\n\\u2022 I don't really like having to be signed in with a Facebook account.\\nI don't think this is going to change anytime soon if ever though.\\n\\nI've played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (H3VR), Blade & Sorcery, Pavlov, and Legendary Tales with my headset. I've played around 76 hours since I got it and aside from the headaches problem (which I've solved recently) it's been absolutely amazing and immersive. I've also used it to watch youtube, streaming shows, and movies. I absolutely love the thing for every use I've had for it so far. It's an absolute blast to experience actually fighting an opponent yourself whether it be that sniper in his tower or a bunch of knights. Just through the games themselves there's an amazing amount of stuff to experience but adding mods makes it even better. This headset can get your foot in the door to worlds you've always wanted to see in person at a pretty cheap price compared to it's competitors. Past video game levels, fantasy settings, all sorts of places to see and things to do.\\n\\nAn aspect you might have been thinking about is this is a great fitness tool even without dedicated fitness apps. Before you realize it you'll be sweaty and tired from swinging your arms, moving around, and holding your arms in front of you for surprisingly long periods of time. Pretty much anything you do with your VR will involve some level of activity and the gaming will almost certainly help kick your butt into shape. You should still visit the gym and make sure you're eating right though.\\n\\nI have only done gaming through PCVR and SteamVR. I have not tried any of the games for the headset on it's own nor do I expect to anytime soon. If you're looking for info on them then sorry but I can't help you with that.\\n\\nThere's several improvements I'd love to see either through future patches or future products. Probably the easiest would be the ability to verify and repair to latest patch the headset software from settings (if it's there I haven't found it). That way if my air link problem is software based I could fix it easily without having to do something like factory resetting the thing. If not then that's one more troubleshooting step I can cross off on my own fairly easily. In the next model or with an accessory if it's possible one thing I'd like is a second dedicated charge port allowing the use of a link cable and a charger with more oomph than a PC's USB 3 port would typically have for longer play times both at the same time. Another thing I'd like is a fabric cover. While the silicone cover is nice and stops the foam from irritating my face I'd love to have an official machine washable fabric facial interface cover that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.\",\n",
            "            \"7\": \"I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate.

Holy freakin\\u2019 crap!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that\\u2019s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station.

I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I\\u2019m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I\\u2019m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I\\u2019m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn\\u2019t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\\n\\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I\\u2019ll be using like crazy.\\n\\nTonight I\\u2019m going to try watching a movie on it.

There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I\\u2019ll be using like crazy.\\n\\nTonight I\\u2019m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it\\u2019s even better that I imagined. Best little toy I\\u2019ve bought myself in years.\",\n",
            "            \"8\": \"This quest 2 is awesome. I bought my son one three years ago and he played with it daily. It just stopped working so I bought another.\",\n",
            "            \"9\": \"Pros:\\n- Fairly Immersive.\\n- Amazing experiences.\\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA\\u2019s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the \\u2018pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends\\u2019 fantasy.\\n\\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro\\u2019s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it\\u2019ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I\\u2019ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I\\u2019ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This\\u2019ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\\n\\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\\n\\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\\n\\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.\",\n",
            "            \"10\": \"So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\\n\\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\\n\\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\\n\\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\\n\\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\\n\\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\\n\\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\\n\\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\\n\\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\\n\\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\\n\\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.\"\n",

I was mainly looking for solid mic quality with the ability to hear yourself while talking. This headset exceeded my expectations! The mic monitoring and audio quality are amazing, and the battery life is about 2 days. It connects immediately and has very good range. I get clear sound quality even 30-40' away. Overall, this headset is everything I was hoping for. I did read several reviews stating that it is fragile and breaks easily, so I have made sure to be gentle with it. Highly recommend!\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Don't skimp on your peripherals. Get quality products from the get go or you will pay for it later. I tried saving money by getting cheap headsets. I have gone through 3 until I finally upgraded for the Turtle Beach. Seriously, the money I spent on the cheap ones would have almost fully paid for this set.\\n\\nQuality sound all around. Its peak performance compared to other brands (including official xbox set). Best features:\\n1. Two dials to control sound. One is for game volume and the other is for party volume. The second being my favorite feature when I don't want to hear heavy breathing or slurping on the other end lol.\\n2. The microphone itself. Flipping up puts it on mute, reverse to talk again. Freaking awesome. Plus it can pivot towards your face if your voice isn't reaching for some reason.\\n\\nWorst feature:\\n1. Pressing the power button a second time to get enhanced audio? Not sure if it works or not. I haven't really noticed anything. There is no risk of turning off the headset that way though, you have to press and hold for that, so that feature is great.\\n\\nI would say 4.9 but we can't get that precise with our review. I'd say this is a perfect set for anything you are doing game or streaming wise, especially if you have tinnitus.\",\n",

And that's it. That's the extent of my cons list.\\n\\nThe good: outrageously quicker load times. I've been playing a lot of Fallout 76. On my PS4, it would routinely take upwards of 45 seconds to \\\"fast\\\" travel. I got in the habit of grabbing the phone and scrolling social media while it loaded. On the PS5, it's more like 10 seconds, tops. Usually much less.\\n\\nI've also been playing the new(ish) God of War and load times are almost immediate. It's uncanny.\\n\\nI've got an older TV (probably 2012) and even still, the graphics are a significant step forward.\\n\\nUltimately, it's everything I loved about my PS4, except better. There's not a single area where I feel like they took a step back except in storage...I had a 1 TB Black Ops 3 edition and would have liked the PS5 to beat that without resorting to aftermarket help.\\n\\nOtherwise, the controller feels better in my hands and has some cool bells and whistles (integrated mic, multi-function giant button, etc.), the load times are vastly improved with the SSD, and the games look better and run better.\",\n",

Copy of Spiderman 2 came with it as well as a download code, thats y only real \\\"comlaint\\\" i wish it was a game case with a disc but you cant complain for the price of the bundle you get a new revised slim version of the ps5 and a new game with it, i love the feel of the ps5 controller its way better than the ps4 controller. Biggest thing i've noticed is the console is absolutly silent to the point i have forgotten it was even on because my PC fans on low are louder than it. Overall a great console and a great bundle if you've been waiting to upgrade from ps4 as i have, this is the time you should take that chance to upgrade and now i can take full advantage of my 120hz 4K moniter so all in all this was a perfect bundle to buy as an early christmas present for yourself or someone else who's wanted to upgrade to the next generation consoles.\",\n",

Fortunately, her birthday is around Black Friday so Amazon had it on somewhat of a sale with Spider-Man. Few days later, it got delivered but we had a one week trip to Spain planned and she didn't get to open it. Sad face. The whole trip she kept talking about how excited she was to get back and setup the console to play. I literally married a child. Fast forward one week, we get back and the first thing she does is set up the ps5. According to her, the setup process was fairly easy. One thing we noticed is that the screen reader is default set to on. This was a bit annoying when you didn't expect it to be defaulted to on. A quick google search showed us how to disable it. Game play is super duper smooth but you need to make sure your HDMI cable is up to date as we originally used one from 2010 so the resolution was stuck at 1080. Graphics have come such a long way from my Xbox 360 days. Spider-Man's story line is fun to play along to and quite challenging. Wife is super happy that she has the ps5 now but I'm worried we're going to be spending a lot of money on games now. But, you know what they say, happy wife... (and that's it)\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.\",\n",

Holy freakin\\u2019 crap!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that\\u2019s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station.

It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\\n\\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\\n\\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\\n\\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\\n\\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\\n\\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.\",\n",

            "        \"6\": \"I bought this knowing the Quest 3 was out, but the price was the primary consideration for me at the time. I find this to be better or fit my needs better as I only wanted something for PCVR, and this fits the bill fine if you're seeking out for that experience without paying too much.\\n\\nWhat are some of the pros? One was that I found the overall setup experience to be seamless and relatively headache free. Second, the controllers and headset feel sturdy and well made, probably meant to withstand accidental scrapes and impacts with objects, cause that will happen regardless if you're careful with your play area. Third is the integration with Steam VR, and you can just play any games in your library from the get-go without any issues as long as you have a cable that supports the bandwidth required, or also charge while playing so you can have an extended session.\\n\\nThe only con that I have with this headset is the lack of IPD adjustability, which means I have to wear my prescription glasses and attach the spacers if I want to use the headset and not experience any blurriness. The Quest 3 has it built in as standard, but is also $200 over the MSRP of the Quest 2. It's not exactly the biggest drawback honestly, as it can vary from person to person.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"At 26, and with a love for all things fun and techy, the Meta Quest 2 has been my latest craze. It's like unwrapping a present every time I put it on\\u2014with its vast world of games and immersive design experiences. Just a heads-up from someone who values comfort as much as a spontaneous dance-off: get the Elite Strap. It's the comfort upgrade that lets you play longer, design more, and dive deeper into VR without that 'need-a-break' feeling. Trust me, it's the smart move!\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"This was the best thing i've ordered in my life. I had tons of fun with it. The only things i dont like is the default headstrap. Its super uncomfortable. But you can always buy a new one, the... elite headstrap.\\n\\nAlso, the charger had an american outlet shape, so i couldnt stick it anywhere, but i came up with a solution and somehow fused it with one of unused cables that go with my outlet's shape and the charger works perfectly now.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Pros:\\n- Fairly Immersive.\\n- Amazing experiences.\\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA\\u2019s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the \\u2018pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends\\u2019 fantasy.\\n\\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro\\u2019s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it\\u2019ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I\\u2019ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I\\u2019ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This\\u2019ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\\n\\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\\n\\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\\n\\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\\n\\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\\n\\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\\n\\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\\n\\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\\n\\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\\n\\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\\n\\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\\n\\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\\n\\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\\n\\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Update: Five Weeks Later\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else.\\n\\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they had made a lighter headset without the upgraded passthrough, but now passthrough is everything to me. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Eleven Table Tennis, and Meta Quest Browser for AR female hologram eye candy. One of the first AR games that I tried is a free game called First Encounters. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I might have bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I am sure that I will keep installed and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the default Quest 3 wall charger and link cable. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging the cord or the Quest 3 cable. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\\n\\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App lets you stream your PCVR games to your Quest headset, wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers. Virtual Desktop lets you have a virtual desktop in passthrough mode, but Immersed lets you too and in Immersed you can have up to four computer screens and you get to be around other users and their avatars. I still use Virtual Desktop for the head lock feature, which keeps the desktop screen in front of your face no matter what direction are are facing or where you move or walk to. I use it to read manhua while walking around the house for exercise. I am hoping that the headlock feature will be added to Immersed soon.\\n\\nResident Evil 4. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is VR or something but it truly is fun walking around in a realistic setting. I like the scenery better than Arizona Sunshine or The Walking Dead. The first Red Matter game was great, but sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value once you've completed the story. Green Hell looks really interesting. It's a realistic survival game. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game that is sorta interesting if co-op RPG games are your thing. It is a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. Genotype is a bit interesting. but the texture detail isn't as high as I would like.\\n\\nFor fitness, I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nI also suggest getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR). On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and mirror you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor in PCVR games. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \\\"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\\\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 65% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people to try the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much?\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \\\"pancake\\\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \\\"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\\\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \\\"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\\\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"There is no doubt this thing is superior to the Quest 2 in almost every way possible. Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.\\n\\nPros -\\nDisplay - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.\\n\\nAudio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvement\\n\\nAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nDisplay\\n\\nWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.\\n\\n1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.\\n\\n2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.\\n\\n3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.\\n\\n4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.\\n\\nComfort\\n\\nThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.\\n\\nEcosystem\\n\\nThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headset\\n\\nPassthrough\\n\\nThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR\\u00b9, thus far the native apps aren\\u2019t of interest] and didn\\u2019t use it as much as I\\u2019d expected.\\u00b2 With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I\\u2019ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2\\u2019s Fresnel lenses and the Q3\\u2019s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the \\u201csweet-spot\\u201d is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I\\u2019m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3f Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. \\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude10 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2\\u2019s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3\\u2019s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I\\u2019ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I\\u2019ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n\\u2022 battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n\\u2022 native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I\\u2019m sad there weren\\u2019t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it\\u2019s a still terrific bargain. It\\u2019s a shame about the contrast though \\ud83d\\ude39\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn\\u2019t have wifi enabled and couldn\\u2019t figure out why it wouldn\\u2019t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n\\u00b9 \\u2014 For PCVR I\\u2019m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta\\u2019s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I\\u2019ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I\\u2019ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop\\u2019s \\u201cHVEC 10-bit\\u201d encoder, which graphically is better than the plain \\u201cHVEC\\u201d encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n\\u00b2 \\u2014 Considering the price I paid vis-\\u00e0-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I've been in the VR game for a while now, going all the way back to the Oculus Rift dev kit 2 days. My other current headset is a Valve Index, and I mainly bought the Quest 3 with the intention of playing the Quest-exclusive games, fully expecting it to feel like a toy in comparison.\\n\\nIn practice, I'm in love with this thing. The displays are both high resolution and high quality, with little to no screendoor effect, and the tracking is impressively stable for something only being tracked by cameras and software. I thought the removal of the rings from the Q2 controllers would cause them to have more issues with occlusion, but I haven't noticed anything. Even the features I didn't know it had are pretty cool for the games that support them, like its mixed reality and controller-free hand tracking. But the thing that's really going to keep me away from my Index (at least for the games that aren't specifically tailored to it, like Half Life Alyx) is that I had no idea how much I needed to ditch the cable and play wirelessly until now. Being able to just walk around in my room without having to be aware of the cable behind me is such a nice feeling that it feels like I'm getting into VR for the first time again.\\n\\nWith that said, there are some small caveats -- namely, that this is not really a $500 headset. Meta has taken on a sort of Spirit Airlines approach, where the headset itself is affordably priced in exchange for other basic things being extremely expensive \\\"accessories\\\". The strap is the main offender, with the default one being the rough equivalent of just tying the headset to your head. They're happy to sell you a $60 strap, or a $130 one that extends the battery, though! And while you're at it you can blow $80 on a cable for linking it to your pc if you aren't a fan of wireless tethering, a $70 carrying case, a $40 silicone facial interface for extra comfort, a $130 charging dock to replace the controllers needing AA batteries, $40 hand straps for the controllers to give them Index-esque free-hand support... To be clear, most, if not all of these have off-brand counterparts that are just as good (or better!) for a fraction of the price, but my point is this is not a fully out of the box experience for those with more discerning tastes. For parents buying them for their younger children they'll probably be thrilled with it anyways, and can safely ignore all of that, but I would wager most adults will probably end up wanting at least a new head strap of some kind, whether it's the official one or not.\\n\\nIgnoring the troublesome accessories, though, this is an easy win as far as I'm concerned. The only real competition is that the Quest 2 is still holding its own as well from what I hear, and for prices that seem to be as low as they could possibly be around the holiday season. I can't speak first-hand on whether the Q3 is worth a $300 difference, but I can say I don't regret buying it. I held off on the Quest line of headsets because I've never been a big fan of Meta as a company, but I have to begrudgingly admit that this is probably the best vr headset at the best price you could get right now.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"The product arrived today, i recorded the opening and bootup.\\nNo dead pixels, passthrough works, there was a small issue with the nose piece not set but after looking it up it seems to be a common issue because of the way the VR opens/closes to adjust to face sizes.\\n\\nIf this occurs, gently push along the nose ridge and it will readjust itself as long as no lock-tab parts are actually damaged. I lucked out, as none of the tabs were broken and were able to go back into place.\\n\\nThe amazon box it came in again didn't have any protection what so ever. But the product itself was fine/stable in it's package box with appropriate padding.\\n\\nI had no issues getting it registered to meta, and grabbed a couple of free games that downloaded quickly enough. I haven't tried them, but I did explore the passthrough and nonpassthrough feature.\\n\\nVisual wise it's actually quite a bit more clear/crisp compared to the ps4 Vr(which is what I can compare it to). As it has a higher resolution/pixel count. I still haven't taken off the default stickers that protect the lenses until I can put on lense protectors. But even through all of the writing on the label that tells you NOT to use any form of liquid cleaners, even lense. It's visual is damn good.\\n\\nThe passthrough visual via camera is on par with a ps4 VR headset: and suffer's some glitches when it hits reflective surfaces but that is normal as camera's hate that extra reflection of light.. But interface/scenes are definitely more clear and crisp. Sound quality is good, not like being at a rock concert, but goes loud enough to enjoy. Headsets for sound actually aren't really needed for this VR.\\n\\nI haven't hooked it up to a computer yet, as it's suppose to be the 'big' gift for me and my fianc\\u00e9 to enjoy over Christmas. As it was a purchase done by the both of us - after calculating expenses..\\n\\nSo the big question: Is it worth the money?\\n\\nMy answer: Yes, I recommend going for the larger size because most of the games you will be downloading are often between 5-40gb.. With a few exceptions that could easily hit 80gb - example skyrim(haven't checked the store to see if that one is available on meta). Plus any mods one might want to add to the games.\\n\\nI was glad to see they had some of my more unique playstation favorites in their store. This made me happy, despite needing to buy it again. (Btw The Wizards* is excellent and lets you feel like your literally casting spells, or using a bow.)\\n\\nWith that said, go for the BIGGER hard drive: it will make it so your VR can hold more then 3 games without suffering quality issues. As you always want to leave room(1-5gb) for the OS(opperating system) to run smoothly. Then you won't have to worry about uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing cache/HD maintence every time you want to change your lineup.\\n\\n**For people with limited understanding of storage space 512GB should easily allow you to store 15-25games which if you have 'data' usage limits for whatever reason would avoid burn up of data by constantly downloading the same thing.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \\\"rug burn\\\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone\\u2661\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Buy the Quest 3, DO NOT BUY THE QUEST 2. I still use my Quest 2 it's great but I don't care how cheap it is, the Quest 3 is that much better in both performance and visuals. Even games not updated still look and play smoother. The Quest 3 is good enough to get into VR gaming without a PC. The Quest 1 felt like a gimmick , the Quest 2 was good but still felt compromised but the Quest 3 (while obviously not as a good the average PCVR gaming pc) is able to get much closer and provide a PCVR like experience on newer games. Mixed reality was not something I was interested in but after trying it I think it's awesome, even if you consider it a gimmick it's very cool and fun tech. As someone who really only cared about PC based VR gaming I've been very impressed with the Quest 3. After going on a VR binge in 2019 and some of 2020 I've mostly only played VRChat now but because of the Quest 3 I started exploring VR games again trying out new and old games and even mixed reality stuff too. It's that good but I'd recommend an aftermarket headstrap. The included headstrap seems pretty bad but if you fiddle with it A LOT it can get comfy. Also I returned my 128GB model and bought the 512GB one. It should not cost that much more in price but honestly there's so much cool stuff and games are slowly getting bigger. If you have fast internet , you can buy the 128GB and be fine.\\n\\nThere's tons of amateur and professional unboxing videos of the Quest 3 that you can look at if you want to see what it looks like. As for what it's like to buy and own it? It's amazing.\\nBackground info: I've been a computer based VR player since 2017 when I got the original Oculus Rift also known as the CV1 on a Black Friday sale. Since then I've bought an Index in 2020 with vive trackers for full body tracking, a Quest 1 as a backup headset, a Quest 2 and now a Quest 3. I have about 6000 hours in VR 5000 of that is in VRChat.\\nReview: The Quest 3 is incredible. It's my first VR headset that uses pancake lens and it's beautiful. I dabbled in standalone gaming on my Quest 2 with games like Resident Evil 4 VR and Iron Man VR which were both great. Iron Man felt a little held back resolution wise with aggressive foveated rendering BUT THE Quest 3 fixes that mostly with higher resolution in literally everything. Everything from the interface to all old and new games feel snappy. I started playing mixed reality mini games like the Ghost Busters one and Synth Riders and the free built in Alien one and everything has been super cool. it's all surprisingly fun. Audio is also great, about as good as the Index. The whole thing feels more reliable though as my Index cable is annoying with how heavy and thick it is. I'm on my third cable in 3 years and still the Index needs to be unplugged sometimes to make it work. I've had no such problems on my Quest 2 and Quest 3. The only reason I still use my Index is for easy full body tracking in VRChat otherwise I play everything on my Quest 3.\",\n",

Fortunately, her birthday is around Black Friday so Amazon had it on somewhat of a sale with Spider-Man. Few days later, it got delivered but we had a one week trip to Spain planned and she didn't get to open it. Sad face. The whole trip she kept talking about how excited she was to get back and setup the console to play. I literally married a child. Fast forward one week, we get back and the first thing she does is set up the ps5. According to her, the setup process was fairly easy. One thing we noticed is that the screen reader is default set to on. This was a bit annoying when you didn't expect it to be defaulted to on. A quick google search showed us how to disable it. Game play is super duper smooth but you need to make sure your HDMI cable is up to date as we originally used one from 2010 so the resolution was stuck at 1080. Graphics have come such a long way from my Xbox 360 days. Spider-Man's story line is fun to play along to and quite challenging.

            "        \"1\": \"First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I\\u2019d see if it was all I\\u2019d hoped it might be. Holy freakin\\u2019 crap!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that\\u2019s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I\\u2019ve instructed it.\\n\\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I\\u2019m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I\\u2019m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I\\u2019m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn\\u2019t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\\n\\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I\\u2019ll be using like crazy.\\n\\nTonight I\\u2019m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it\\u2019s even better that I imagined.

            "        \"3\": \"I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\\n\\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\\n\\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\\n\\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\\n\\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\\n\\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\\n\\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I bought this to make sure I stayed active in my retirement years. Easy to use. Realistic beyond belief. If you wear glasses, make sure you put in the glasses spacer. You can do this by removing the black rubber around the perimeter of the mask. Start at the nose and pull up. Put in the spacer, then reattach the rubber. Makes a big difference. Favorite games are Beat Saber, 7th Guest, and the Jig saw puzzles. First time on 3D puzzles. Amazing.\\n\\nStop before you get tired, otherwise you might find yourself trying to lean against the realistic tables to rest a minute (7th Guest). You won't do it more than once! They're not really there! Have fun.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"THIS IS FOR MY SON, HE HAD ONE AND IT BROKE... GOT HIM A NEW ONE... ONLY COMPLAINT WOULD BE THE VR IT SELF IS SMALLER AND SEEMS TO BE TIGHT AROUND THE HEAD PART.... WE COMPARED TEH OLD ONE AND NEW ONE AND IT IS INDEED A TAD SMALLER.... WE DID GET THE BATTERY ADD ON THIS TIME, AND THAT IS GREAT!!! WORKS WELL, AND BATTERY ADD ON IS GREAT.. KEEP IN MIND IF YOU HAVE HAD ONE BEFORE, AND BUY A NEW VR 2 IT IS THE SAME, BUT IS SMALLER...LITTLE TIGHT , NOT SURE WHY THEY WOULD MAKE IT SMALLER. BUT WORKS WELL!! MY SON IS VERY HAPPY!!!\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I bought this knowing the Quest 3 was out, but the price was the primary consideration for me at the time. I find this to be better or fit my needs better as I only wanted something for PCVR, and this fits the bill fine if you're seeking out for that experience without paying too much.\\n\\nWhat are some of the pros? One was that I found the overall setup experience to be seamless and relatively headache free. Second, the controllers and headset feel sturdy and well made, probably meant to withstand accidental scrapes and impacts with objects, cause that will happen regardless if you're careful with your play area. Third is the integration with Steam VR, and you can just play any games in your library from the get-go without any issues as long as you have a cable that supports the bandwidth required, or also charge while playing so you can have an extended session.\\n\\nThe only con that I have with this headset is the lack of IPD adjustability, which means I have to wear my prescription glasses and attach the spacers if I want to use the headset and not experience any blurriness. The Quest 3 has it built in as standard, but is also $200 over the MSRP of the Quest 2. It's not exactly the biggest drawback honestly, as it can vary from person to person.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"At 26, and with a love for all things fun and techy, the Meta Quest 2 has been my latest craze. It's like unwrapping a present every time I put it on\\u2014with its vast world of games and immersive design experiences. Just a heads-up from someone who values comfort as much as a spontaneous dance-off: get the Elite Strap. It's the comfort upgrade that lets you play longer, design more, and dive deeper into VR without that 'need-a-break' feeling. Trust me, it's the smart move!\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"This was the best thing i've ordered in my life. I had tons of fun with it. The only things i dont like is the default headstrap. Its super uncomfortable. But you can always buy a new one, the... elite headstrap.\\n\\nAlso, the charger had an american outlet shape, so i couldnt stick it anywhere, but i came up with a solution and somehow fused it with one of unused cables that go with my outlet's shape and the charger works perfectly now.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Pros:\\n- Fairly Immersive.\\n- Amazing experiences.\\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA\\u2019s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the \\u2018pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends\\u2019 fantasy.\\n\\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro\\u2019s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it\\u2019ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I\\u2019ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I\\u2019ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This\\u2019ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\\n\\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\\n\\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\\n\\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\\n\\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\\n\\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\\n\\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\\n\\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\\n\\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\\n\\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\\n\\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\\n\\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\\n\\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\\n\\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Update: Five Weeks Later\\n\\nThe Quest 2 was so unbearably painful and uncomfortable for me, no matter what I did, that I ended up returning it a day later.\\n\\nI was actually afraid that the Quest 3 wasn't worth getting because it weighs the same as the Quest 2, even 12 grams more.\\n\\nBut the Quest 3, with its default strap, is wonderful to wear. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else.\\n\\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they had made a lighter headset without the upgraded passthrough, but now passthrough is everything to me. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Eleven Table Tennis, and Meta Quest Browser for AR female hologram eye candy. One of the first AR games that I tried is a free game called First Encounters. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I might have bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I am sure that I will keep installed and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Immersed, Virtual Desktop, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the default Quest 3 wall charger and link cable. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging the cord or the Quest 3 cable. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like 0.5 to 1.5 hours.\\n\\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App lets you stream your PCVR games to your Quest headset, wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers. Virtual Desktop lets you have a virtual desktop in passthrough mode, but Immersed lets you too and in Immersed you can have up to four computer screens and you get to be around other users and their avatars. I still use Virtual Desktop for the head lock feature, which keeps the desktop screen in front of your face no matter what direction are are facing or where you move or walk to. I use it to read manhua while walking around the house for exercise. I am hoping that the headlock feature will be added to Immersed soon.\\n\\nResident Evil 4. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is VR or something but it truly is fun walking around in a realistic setting. I like the scenery better than Arizona Sunshine or The Walking Dead. The first Red Matter game was great, but sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value once you've completed the story. Green Hell looks really interesting. It's a realistic survival game. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game that is sorta interesting if co-op RPG games are your thing. It is a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. Genotype is a bit interesting. but the texture detail isn't as high as I would like.\\n\\nFor fitness, I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nI also suggest getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR). On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and mirror you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor in PCVR games. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \\\"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\\\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 65% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people to try the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much?\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \\\"pancake\\\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \\\"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\\\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \\\"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\\\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"There is no doubt this thing is superior to the Quest 2 in almost every way possible. Is it worth the increase in price to $499? Probably. The Quest 2 was sold at low margins to gain market share and if you compare this to the PSVR2 headset you could make a solid argument that it offers a lot more value.\\n\\nPros -\\nDisplay - this is the biggest improvement from the previous generation. I would have never contemplated using my Quest as a desktop replacement prior to using the Quest 3. I probably still wont, however, the fact that I even considered it is testament to the clarity this thing provides.\\n\\nAudio - another step up from the previous generation and probably the only other major improvement\\n\\nAR - so much potential. Still early stages so who knows how well this will be utilized.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nDisplay\\n\\nWhile the display offers marked improvement there are a couple of things you should be aware of to keep your expectations in check.\\n\\n1. Pancake lenses have a slightly annoying reflection effect in high contrast situations. If you're a perfectionist, it will piss you off. It's almost like the lenses look smudged in certain conditions but in fact it's just a reflection effect.\\n\\n2. The screen door effect is almost gone but it is still slightly there. Much better but not quite gone.\\n\\n3. I had hoped they would use OLED on Mini LED panels in this thing but unfortunately they didn't. Watching movies would be amazing with a panel that didn't have this much LCD glow, especially with the improved sharpness. Oh well, something for the Quest 4 to improve upon.\\n\\n4. The FOV has barely improved. This thing would be insane if it didn't feel like you were looking through a large pair of binoculars. I'm not sure what it would take to improve the current FOV but it definitely prevents complete immersion.\\n\\nComfort\\n\\nThe headset is a little challenging to get seated on your face properly without generating uncomfortable pressure. There is also this new gap at the bottom of the nose region that I'm sure exists for a reason but it hurts immersion as you can see the floor.\\n\\nEcosystem\\n\\nThere isn't a lot to take advantage of the new processing power and AR features of the headset\\n\\nPassthrough\\n\\nThere is no doubt that it is significantly better than the B&W grainy mess in the previous generation but it requires good lighting conditions to approach anything that you've seen in demo videos. The other thing to be aware of is that the headset records video in higher fidelity than it is able to pass back to the headset display in real time. I'm not sure why this is the case but I'm guessing there is some post processing going on to clean up the videos that the headset can't do in real time.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR\\u00b9, thus far the native apps aren\\u2019t of interest] and didn\\u2019t use it as much as I\\u2019d expected.\\u00b2 With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I\\u2019ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels.

I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. \\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude10 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2\\u2019s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3\\u2019s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I\\u2019ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I\\u2019ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n\\u2022 battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n\\u2022 native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I\\u2019m sad there weren\\u2019t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it\\u2019s a still terrific bargain. It\\u2019s a shame about the contrast though \\ud83d\\ude39\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn\\u2019t have wifi enabled and couldn\\u2019t figure out why it wouldn\\u2019t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n\\u00b9 \\u2014 For PCVR I\\u2019m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta\\u2019s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I\\u2019ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I\\u2019ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop\\u2019s \\u201cHVEC 10-bit\\u201d encoder, which graphically is better than the plain \\u201cHVEC\\u201d encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n\\u00b2 \\u2014 Considering the price I paid vis-\\u00e0-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I've been in the VR game for a while now, going all the way back to the Oculus Rift dev kit 2 days. My other current headset is a Valve Index, and I mainly bought the Quest 3 with the intention of playing the Quest-exclusive games, fully expecting it to feel like a toy in comparison.\\n\\nIn practice, I'm in love with this thing. The displays are both high resolution and high quality, with little to no screendoor effect, and the tracking is impressively stable for something only being tracked by cameras and software. I thought the removal of the rings from the Q2 controllers would cause them to have more issues with occlusion, but I haven't noticed anything. Even the features I didn't know it had are pretty cool for the games that support them, like its mixed reality and controller-free hand tracking. But the thing that's really going to keep me away from my Index (at least for the games that aren't specifically tailored to it, like Half Life Alyx) is that I had no idea how much I needed to ditch the cable and play wirelessly until now. Being able to just walk around in my room without having to be aware of the cable behind me is such a nice feeling that it feels like I'm getting into VR for the first time again.\\n\\nWith that said, there are some small caveats -- namely, that this is not really a $500 headset. Meta has taken on a sort of Spirit Airlines approach, where the headset itself is affordably priced in exchange for other basic things being extremely expensive \\\"accessories\\\". The strap is the main offender, with the default one being the rough equivalent of just tying the headset to your head. They're happy to sell you a $60 strap, or a $130 one that extends the battery, though! And while you're at it you can blow $80 on a cable for linking it to your pc if you aren't a fan of wireless tethering, a $70 carrying case, a $40 silicone facial interface for extra comfort, a $130 charging dock to replace the controllers needing AA batteries, $40 hand straps for the controllers to give them Index-esque free-hand support... To be clear, most, if not all of these have off-brand counterparts that are just as good (or better!) for a fraction of the price, but my point is this is not a fully out of the box experience for those with more discerning tastes. For parents buying them for their younger children they'll probably be thrilled with it anyways, and can safely ignore all of that, but I would wager most adults will probably end up wanting at least a new head strap of some kind, whether it's the official one or not.\\n\\nIgnoring the troublesome accessories, though, this is an easy win as far as I'm concerned. The only real competition is that the Quest 2 is still holding its own as well from what I hear, and for prices that seem to be as low as they could possibly be around the holiday season. I can't speak first-hand on whether the Q3 is worth a $300 difference, but I can say I don't regret buying it. I held off on the Quest line of headsets because I've never been a big fan of Meta as a company, but I have to begrudgingly admit that this is probably the best vr headset at the best price you could get right now.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"The product arrived today, i recorded the opening and bootup.\\nNo dead pixels, passthrough works, there was a small issue with the nose piece not set but after looking it up it seems to be a common issue because of the way the VR opens/closes to adjust to face sizes.\\n\\nIf this occurs, gently push along the nose ridge and it will readjust itself as long as no lock-tab parts are actually damaged. I lucked out, as none of the tabs were broken and were able to go back into place.\\n\\nThe amazon box it came in again didn't have any protection what so ever. But the product itself was fine/stable in it's package box with appropriate padding.\\n\\nI had no issues getting it registered to meta, and grabbed a couple of free games that downloaded quickly enough. I haven't tried them, but I did explore the passthrough and nonpassthrough feature.\\n\\nVisual wise it's actually quite a bit more clear/crisp compared to the ps4 Vr(which is what I can compare it to). As it has a higher resolution/pixel count. I still haven't taken off the default stickers that protect the lenses until I can put on lense protectors. But even through all of the writing on the label that tells you NOT to use any form of liquid cleaners, even lense. It's visual is damn good.\\n\\nThe passthrough visual via camera is on par with a ps4 VR headset: and suffer's some glitches when it hits reflective surfaces but that is normal as camera's hate that extra reflection of light.. But interface/scenes are definitely more clear and crisp. Sound quality is good, not like being at a rock concert, but goes loud enough to enjoy. Headsets for sound actually aren't really needed for this VR.\\n\\nI haven't hooked it up to a computer yet, as it's suppose to be the 'big' gift for me and my fianc\\u00e9 to enjoy over Christmas. As it was a purchase done by the both of us - after calculating expenses..\\n\\nSo the big question: Is it worth the money?\\n\\nMy answer: Yes, I recommend going for the larger size because most of the games you will be downloading are often between 5-40gb.. With a few exceptions that could easily hit 80gb - example skyrim(haven't checked the store to see if that one is available on meta). Plus any mods one might want to add to the games.\\n\\nI was glad to see they had some of my more unique playstation favorites in their store. This made me happy, despite needing to buy it again. (Btw The Wizards* is excellent and lets you feel like your literally casting spells, or using a bow.)\\n\\nWith that said, go for the BIGGER hard drive: it will make it so your VR can hold more then 3 games without suffering quality issues. As you always want to leave room(1-5gb) for the OS(opperating system) to run smoothly. Then you won't have to worry about uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing cache/HD maintence every time you want to change your lineup.\\n\\n**For people with limited understanding of storage space 512GB should easily allow you to store 15-25games which if you have 'data' usage limits for whatever reason would avoid burn up of data by constantly downloading the same thing.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \\\"rug burn\\\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone\\u2661\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Buy the Quest 3, DO NOT BUY THE QUEST 2. I still use my Quest 2 it's great but I don't care how cheap it is, the Quest 3 is that much better in both performance and visuals. Even games not updated still look and play smoother. The Quest 3 is good enough to get into VR gaming without a PC. The Quest 1 felt like a gimmick , the Quest 2 was good but still felt compromised but the Quest 3 (while obviously not as a good the average PCVR gaming pc) is able to get much closer and provide a PCVR like experience on newer games. Mixed reality was not something I was interested in but after trying it I think it's awesome, even if you consider it a gimmick it's very cool and fun tech. As someone who really only cared about PC based VR gaming I've been very impressed with the Quest 3. After going on a VR binge in 2019 and some of 2020 I've mostly only played VRChat now but because of the Quest 3 I started exploring VR games again trying out new and old games and even mixed reality stuff too. It's that good but I'd recommend an aftermarket headstrap. The included headstrap seems pretty bad but if you fiddle with it A LOT it can get comfy. Also I returned my 128GB model and bought the 512GB one. It should not cost that much more in price but honestly there's so much cool stuff and games are slowly getting bigger. If you have fast internet , you can buy the 128GB and be fine.\\n\\nThere's tons of amateur and professional unboxing videos of the Quest 3 that you can look at if you want to see what it looks like. As for what it's like to buy and own it? It's amazing.\\nBackground info: I've been a computer based VR player since 2017 when I got the original Oculus Rift also known as the CV1 on a Black Friday sale. Since then I've bought an Index in 2020 with vive trackers for full body tracking, a Quest 1 as a backup headset, a Quest 2 and now a Quest 3. I have about 6000 hours in VR 5000 of that is in VRChat.\\nReview: The Quest 3 is incredible. It's my first VR headset that uses pancake lens and it's beautiful. I dabbled in standalone gaming on my Quest 2 with games like Resident Evil 4 VR and Iron Man VR which were both great. Iron Man felt a little held back resolution wise with aggressive foveated rendering BUT THE Quest 3 fixes that mostly with higher resolution in literally everything. Everything from the interface to all old and new games feel snappy. I started playing mixed reality mini games like the Ghost Busters one and Synth Riders and the free built in Alien one and everything has been super cool. it's all surprisingly fun. Audio is also great, about as good as the Index. The whole thing feels more reliable though as my Index cable is annoying with how heavy and thick it is. I'm on my third cable in 3 years and still the Index needs to be unplugged sometimes to make it work. I've had no such problems on my Quest 2 and Quest 3. The only reason I still use my Index is for easy full body tracking in VRChat otherwise I play everything on my Quest 3.\",\n",

And that's it. That's the extent of my cons list.\\n\\nThe good: outrageously quicker load times. I've been playing a lot of Fallout 76. On my PS4, it would routinely take upwards of 45 seconds to \\\"fast\\\" travel. I got in the habit of grabbing the phone and scrolling social media while it loaded. On the PS5, it's more like 10 seconds, tops. Usually much less.\\n\\nI've also been playing the new(ish) God of War and load times are almost immediate. It's uncanny.\\n\\nI've got an older TV (probably 2012) and even still, the graphics are a significant step forward.\\n\\nUltimately, it's everything I loved about my PS4, except better. There's not a single area where I feel like they took a step back except in storage...I had a 1 TB Black Ops 3 edition and would have liked the PS5 to beat that without resorting to aftermarket help.\\n\\nOtherwise, the controller feels better in my hands and has some cool bells and whistles (integrated mic, multi-function giant button, etc.), the load times are vastly improved with the SSD, and the games look better and run better.\",\n",

Copy of Spiderman 2 came with it as well as a download code, thats y only real \\\"comlaint\\\" i wish it was a game case with a disc but you cant complain for the price of the bundle you get a new revised slim version of the ps5 and a new game with it, i love the feel of the ps5 controller its way better than the ps4 controller. Biggest thing i've noticed is the console is absolutly silent to the point i have forgotten it was even on because my PC fans on low are louder than it. Overall a great console and a great bundle if you've been waiting to upgrade from ps4 as i have, this is the time you should take that chance to upgrade and now i can take full advantage of my 120hz 4K moniter so all in all this was a perfect bundle to buy as an early christmas present for yourself or someone else who's wanted to upgrade to the next generation consoles.\",\n",

Fortunately, her birthday is around Black Friday so Amazon had it on somewhat of a sale with Spider-Man. Few days later, it got delivered but we had a one week trip to Spain planned and she didn't get to open it. Sad face. The whole trip she kept talking about how excited she was to get back and setup the console to play. I literally married a child. Fast forward one week, we get back and the first thing she does is set up the ps5. According to her, the setup process was fairly easy. One thing we noticed is that the screen reader is default set to on. This was a bit annoying when you didn't expect it to be defaulted to on. A quick google search showed us how to disable it. Game play is super duper smooth but you need to make sure your HDMI cable is up to date as we originally used one from 2010 so the resolution was stuck at 1080. Graphics have come such a long way from my Xbox 360 days. Spider-Man's story line is fun to play along to and quite challenging. Wife is super happy that she has the ps5 now but I'm worried we're going to be spending a lot of money on games now. But, you know what they say, happy wife... (and that's it)\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I\\u2019d see if it was all I\\u2019d hoped it might be. Holy freakin\\u2019 crap!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that\\u2019s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I\\u2019ve instructed it.\\n\\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I\\u2019m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I\\u2019m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I\\u2019m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn\\u2019t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\\n\\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes. I can see this is going to be something I\\u2019ll be using like crazy.\\n\\nTonight I\\u2019m going to try watching a movie on it. Apparently one of the apps I downloaded will play from my Netflix account, and put me inside a movie theater with seats, and lit aisles and the movie on a huge screen right in front of me. Really remarkable. I was excited to try one of these out and it turns out it\\u2019s even better that I imagined. Best little toy I\\u2019ve bought myself in years.\\n\\nI did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that\\u2019s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I\\u2019ve instructed it.\\n\\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I\\u2019m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal as I\\u2019m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I\\u2019m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn\\u2019t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that realistic.

            "        \"3\": \"I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\\n\\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\\n\\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\\n\\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\\n\\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\\n\\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\\n\\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I bought this to make sure I stayed active in my retirement years. Easy to use. Realistic beyond belief. If you wear glasses, make sure you put in the glasses spacer. You can do this by removing the black rubber around the perimeter of the mask. Start at the nose and pull up. Put in the spacer, then reattach the rubber. Makes a big difference. Favorite games are Beat Saber, 7th Guest, and the Jig saw puzzles. First time on 3D puzzles. Amazing.\\n\\nStop before you get tired, otherwise you might find yourself trying to lean against the realistic tables to rest a minute (7th Guest). You won't do it more than once! They're not really there! Have fun.\",\n",

KEEP IN MIND IF YOU HAVE HAD ONE BEFORE, AND BUY A NEW VR 2 IT IS THE SAME, BUT IS SMALLER...LITTLE TIGHT , NOT SURE WHY THEY WOULD MAKE IT SMALLER. BUT WORKS WELL!! MY SON IS VERY HAPPY!!!\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I bought this knowing the Quest 3 was out, but the price was the primary consideration for me at the time. I find this to be better or fit my needs better as I only wanted something for PCVR, and this fits the bill fine if you're seeking out for that experience without paying too much.\\n\\nWhat are some of the pros? One was that I found the overall setup experience to be seamless and relatively headache free. Second, the controllers and headset feel sturdy and well made, probably meant to withstand accidental scrapes and impacts with objects, cause that will happen regardless if you're careful with your play area. Third is the integration with Steam VR, and you can just play any games in your library from the get-go without any issues as long as you have a cable that supports the bandwidth required, or also charge while playing so you can have an extended session.\\n\\nThe only con that I have with this headset is the lack of IPD adjustability, which means I have to wear my prescription glasses and attach the spacers if I want to use the headset and not experience any blurriness. The Quest 3 has it built in as standard, but is also $200 over the MSRP of the Quest 2. It's not exactly the biggest drawback honestly, as it can vary from person to person.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"At 26, and with a love for all things fun and techy, the Meta Quest 2 has been my latest craze. It's like unwrapping a present every time I put it on\\u2014with its vast world of games and immersive design experiences. Just a heads-up from someone who values comfort as much as a spontaneous dance-off: get the Elite Strap. It's the comfort upgrade that lets you play longer, design more, and dive deeper into VR without that 'need-a-break' feeling. Trust me, it's the smart move!\",\n",

But you can always buy a new one, the... elite headstrap.\\n\\nAlso, the charger had an american outlet shape, so i couldnt stick it anywhere, but i came up with a solution and somehow fused it with one of unused cables that go with my outlet's shape and the charger works perfectly now.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Pros:\\n- Fairly Immersive.\\n- Amazing experiences.\\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA\\u2019s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the \\u2018pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends\\u2019 fantasy.\\n\\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro\\u2019s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it\\u2019ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I\\u2019ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I\\u2019ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This\\u2019ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\\n\\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\\n\\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\\n\\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\\n\\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\\n\\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\\n\\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\\n\\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\\n\\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\\n\\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\\n\\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\\n\\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\\n\\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\\n\\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"First, a little background. I'm 73 years old. Above average in the activity department, adept mentally, although I am literally the only person I know who can lose something when standing perfectly still. I have four grandchildren. I hold down a full-time job as a writer, and a once-a-year gig teaching Rio Grande Board Games at the annual World Boardgaming Championships (WBC).\\nIt was at the most recent WBC that I was introduced to MetaQuest 2 and in particular, its bundled game called Beat Saber. I'd tried much cheaper VR systems, the ones that hold your phone and you have to download apps to run on them. This was an entirely different ball game. This was, I should note, not a function of the WBC. It just so happened that one of the site administrators had brought the system along with him and one evening, invited me to give it a try.\\nThe first issue that one should note is that once you put the headset for this system on, you are pretty much detached from the reality around you. This is fine as long as it's just you and the machine, but you can forget about being outside the machine and trying to instruct someone inside the machine about what's going on. As it happened, the man who introduced me to the system basically set it up for me - put it on his own head, clicked the right buttons - and then transferred the headset to me. With a couple of hand prompts and a word or two, Beat Saber, the program that comes with the MetaQuest 2 when you buy it these days, came on line and there I stood, with two controllers, one in each hand, as my eyes beheld on the screen in front of me, a series of square blocks coming at me, each with an arrow, pointing either up, down, right or left. The controllers operate two light sabers, one in each hand, and the object of this game is to swat the approaching blocks in the direction indicated by the arrow on them. There are also occasional large obstacles coming at you, like skinny walls, which appear like three-dimensional line drawings as they approach. You can't swat these aside and the idea is to avoid them. In most cases, this entails just stepping out of their way, either to the right or the left, but dependent on some choices you make in Beat Saber, some of these objects can be wide and impossible to avoid unless you duck as they approach. No way to jump over them.\\nAnd there's music. At first, you don't pick up on the idea that your swatting activity with the light sabers can occasionally be rhythmic, linked to the beat of the music. . .Beat Saber. Get it? But you'll pick up on that fairly quickly. If you don't dance and would like to, this is a good program that will force-feed you the concept of moving your body in beat with the rhythm of a song. You don't realize you're dancing because as far as you're concerned, you're swatting colored boxes with virtual reality light sabers. A note of caution. People familiar with the system and how it works will delight in recording video of your attempts to play the game; unbeknowst to you, 'cause you're wrapped up in the headset and can't see anything but what the machine is giving you to see. These people recording you will be LOL-ing themselves breathless, as you contort yourself in a relatively confined space, trying to dodge things and swat at the colored boxes.\\nI made the mistake of failing to heed the warning that if I didn't buy one of these systems soon, its price was going to go up. A lot. And it did. But I bought it anyway and am just beginning to tap into the available free apps and exploring the possibility of buying other ones.\\nThere's a free Epic Roller Coaster app, which is fairly enjoyable, although oddly enough, both myself and my wife (now at home with our own MetaQuest 2) found ourselves getting a little queasy during the experience. Not sure what that's about. She NEVER goes on real roller coasters and I do it all the time.\\nAlso found a walking-on-a-building-skeleton app that had me God knows how many stories high and though not generally afraid of heights (acrophobia), I wasn't all that keen on walking on the available, skinny steel walkways to approach the edge. I'm in my living room, my mind knowing damn full well that I'm not only not as high as the program makes me think I am, but am, in fact, on solid ground. Yet, in an attempt to approach the edge and have a look OVER the edge, I am literally creeping forward, edging my foot out in front of me, making sure of my balance with each step. My mind absolutely refuses to grasp the concept that I am not in any danger.\\nIt should be noted that when you play in virtual reality, the mechanism has you define a space where you are going to be, literally drawing a perimeter line. It's not because the machine is worried you might step off the big building you only think you're on, but when you're playing a game like Beat Saber, you want to make sure that your arm movements don't knock over a lamp your Aunt Ethel gave you for Christmas last year, or in moving your legs around, you don't accidentally kick the screen out of your new Smart TV.\\nI haven't been too excited by any of the first-person shooter kind of apps that are available. That kind of activity never lured me to the various systems that were already on the market. But I did notice and have been on the verge of pulling the trigger on some of the other activities, like table tennis, actual tennis and some other sports activities, like baseball. Am also interested in what is, at present, a small selection of board games, like Tsuro and chess (in a variety of different environments). They offer Catan (originally, Settlers of Catan) and though my interest in board games is strong, I never really liked Catan in real-time, so I'm not going to pick it up in VR.\\nI recommend this system highly. The experience of good VR (and you can buy systems better than the basic one that I purchased) is mind-altering. It's something to which your mind has never been previously exposed; an alternate reality with its own set of rules that takes some getting used to. It's more expensive than pot, but unlike pot, it doesn't just let your head create new connections and free it from everyday anxieties, it creates a reality within your brain that is intriguing to watch, hear and interact with.\\nAnd as my age indicates, fun for all ages.\\nOh, and one other cautionary note for those of a certain advanced age. The first time I tried the system, at the WBC, my score at Beat Saber was abysmally low. So I tried again. And again. It wasn't my hand movements with the controllers or the side-stepping away from approaching objects that got to me. It was the ducking at things that I had to let go over my head. I made the crouching moves necessary with reckless abandon. Once, again, and again. My upper thighs complained to me all of the next day. The good news is that it makes for good, healthy exercise.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I purchased this during the Black Friday sale, so it was $200 after credits, which was a fantastic deal, so that factors into my review.\\n\\nAs someone who has never used a VR headset before, but has been curious about it for a few years, this has been a fun experience so far. It can work as a standalone platform, or you can use it to connect to a PC and play VR games that way. I've seen other people complain that the straps on the headset are uncomfortable, but I haven't had any issues with them.\\n\\nReally, my only issues with the Quest 2 are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Some games seem to make me feel nauseated (Rec Room is the worst offender so far), which isn't helped by the headset getting a bit warm after awhile. I was expected a bit of disorientation, but as I generally don't get motion sick, this was somewhat surprising to me. There are some settings that can be tweaked (especially sitting vs. standing), so I plan to try that out on certain games to see if it helps.\\n\\n(2) Meta's history of privacy issues.\\n\\n(3) The AR cameras are black-and-white and kind of meh quality, so this isn't really viable for any sort of AR applications, which is admittedly a very minor complaint.\\n\\n(4) The battery life seems a bit on the short side.\\n\\nOverall, for $200 (or even $250), this is a fantastic device for someone looking to get into VR. It's versatile, can be used for a wide variety of games and applications, and has been a ton of fun to use so far.\",\n",

            "        \"5\": \"This is an entry level VR headset and it's excellent for its price. I love it. There are quirks with it. Please mind that it was introduced to the market in late 2020 (so 3 years ago from this review) which is eons ago in tech space, so it's getting old, but I still love it.\\n\\nYes it's heavy, yes it works best when connected with a USB cable (for high FPS use), yes it's a little irritating to use generally because when in VR you have to interact with the world around you. So there's the learning curve. You need to invest time using this VR headset before submitting a review because things in VR are disorienting at the beginning -- think like the first time you used a trackball or a mouse.. took time to master.\\n\\nThat being said, I use it primarily for sim racing, it's comfortable, and it's absolutely incredible, so much that once you have the straps figured out properly and worked out the kinks, you can't tell it's even there. The sound that comes out of it is very immersive and good, the field of vision is excellent (I have one bad eye and I see 20/20 with the headset), I love the experience so much that I stopped using other sim racing games that don't support VR. I spend a lot of time on real race tracks in real life, and this VR headset allows me to spend time on the race track when it's raining out or when the season is over.\\n\\nBuy it, you won't regret it\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I have absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this headset. It's fun and the fact that someone on my budget could afford it is really something. I wouldn't have had a VR set if it weren't for this being as affordable as it is. There are some shortcuts clearly taken to help keep it affordable but the actual VR hardware is amazing. Visuals are clear and immersive and it keeps up with my movements very well. If you don't have the money for something like an Index or Vive but want VR this is a great choice. It's also pretty sturdy. I've punched my table so hard my knuckles bled and the controller barely had a mark on it. You also can't tell I've headbutted my desk multiple times trying to pick up guns and rotwiener cores lol.\\n\\nLets get complaints out of the way first:\\n\\u2022 The original strap the headset came with is 100% the absolute worst part of the headset.\\nDo yourself a favor and snag the Kiwi Design head strap while you're here on Amazon. The original strap squeezed the heck out of my head and if I loosened it the headset could flop around a bit causing blurry graphics and just being uncomfortable for a different reason. Due to that constant squeeze it gave me some nasty headaches usually after 2-3 hours of gameplay but sometimes much sooner and they could last the rest of the day. While they're nothing compared to a cluster headache for pain they were still what I'd consider bad.\\n\\u2022 Air link was awesome and worked great but was broken within a week of receiving the headset likely due to a patch (0.37 I think).\\nI didn't get to enjoy it and the only potential bit of troubleshooting I have left to try as far as I've found is a factory reset which I'm reluctant to do. I bought a 3rd party link cable which is working well enough for me but I'd really like to be able to take my gaming to my living room where I have much less risk of punching or breaking anything and have some room to physically move around.\\n\\u2022 I don't really like having to be signed in with a Facebook account.\\nI don't think this is going to change anytime soon if ever though.\\n\\nI've played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (H3VR), Blade & Sorcery, Pavlov, and Legendary Tales with my headset. I've played around 76 hours since I got it and aside from the headaches problem (which I've solved recently) it's been absolutely amazing and immersive. I've also used it to watch youtube, streaming shows, and movies. I absolutely love the thing for every use I've had for it so far. It's an absolute blast to experience actually fighting an opponent yourself whether it be that sniper in his tower or a bunch of knights. Just through the games themselves there's an amazing amount of stuff to experience but adding mods makes it even better. This headset can get your foot in the door to worlds you've always wanted to see in person at a pretty cheap price compared to it's competitors. Past video game levels, fantasy settings, all sorts of places to see and things to do.\\n\\nAn aspect you might have been thinking about is this is a great fitness tool even without dedicated fitness apps. Before you realize it you'll be sweaty and tired from swinging your arms, moving around, and holding your arms in front of you for surprisingly long periods of time. Pretty much anything you do with your VR will involve some level of activity and the gaming will almost certainly help kick your butt into shape. You should still visit the gym and make sure you're eating right though.\\n\\nI have only done gaming through PCVR and SteamVR. I have not tried any of the games for the headset on it's own nor do I expect to anytime soon. If you're looking for info on them then sorry but I can't help you with that.\\n\\nThere's several improvements I'd love to see either through future patches or future products. Probably the easiest would be the ability to verify and repair to latest patch the headset software from settings (if it's there I haven't found it). That way if my air link problem is software based I could fix it easily without having to do something like factory resetting the thing. If not then that's one more troubleshooting step I can cross off on my own fairly easily. In the next model or with an accessory if it's possible one thing I'd like is a second dedicated charge port allowing the use of a link cable and a charger with more oomph than a PC's USB 3 port would typically have for longer play times both at the same time. Another thing I'd like is a fabric cover. While the silicone cover is nice and stops the foam from irritating my face I'd love to have an official machine washable fabric facial interface cover that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"I just finished a rather challenging online degree program the other day and decided I owed myself a little something to celebrate. I had just enough cash to buy one of these and thought I\\u2019d see if it was all I\\u2019d hoped it might be. Holy freakin\\u2019 crap!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to have a little spare cash on hand so to celebrate finishing my classes I bought myself a MetaQuest 2 VR headset package from Amazon. I did the initial set up tonight which was itself amazing. I have a virtual home that\\u2019s my startup lobby for everything and my home is on a space station complete with huge windows with a bright nebula outside and shuttles flying past docking at the station. When I need to access any menus etc., a window just opens up in the air in front of me and with my bare hands I can just tap any commands or instructions I want onto it and it whisks me away to wherever I\\u2019ve instructed it.\\n\\nAfter setting it up I finally gave a shot to my first free, fairly rudimentary game which is pretty much a first-person shooter game. When it loaded up I was in awe as I found myself standing on a high pedestal inside a gigantic flaming stadium where a fleet of mean looking drones start opening fire on me from every direction. I can see I have guns in my hands that are like blasters from Star Wars and I have to shoot down these attacking drones while I\\u2019m spinning in circles trying to pick my targets, and not fall off the pedestal while I\\u2019m firing a barrage of neon pink energy bolts at them. At one point I found myself with each arm outstretched straight out to my left and right sides and was just twirling in a circle firing while spinning and just found myself giggling like a little kid. I\\u2019m really stunned at how real it all looks and feels when that headset is on my face. I didn\\u2019t really think it would be that good, that all-consuming, or that real. I literally felt like I was inside a real-world sci-fi movie and it was incredible!\\n\\nBest thing is this little toy is also a very good piece of workout equipment. There are a ton of apps out there like Supernatural VR that have you constantly punching flaming meteors coming at you while having to jump over obstacles, squat down to keep from having your head knocked off and can get you sweating, wiped out and sore in just a few minutes.

            "        \"9\": \"Pros:\\n- Fairly Immersive.\\n- Amazing experiences.\\n- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.\\n- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)\\n- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)\\n- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.\\n- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.\\n- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)\\n- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.\\n- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.\\n- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.\\n- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.\\n- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.\\n-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.\\n-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.\\n- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.\\n- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.\\n- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.\\n-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA\\u2019s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.\\n- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)\\n-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the \\u2018pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends\\u2019 fantasy.\\n\\nIMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:\\n- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.\\n- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.\\n- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.\\n- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.\\n-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro\\u2019s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.\\n- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it\\u2019ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I\\u2019ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)\\n-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.\\n-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.\\n- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I\\u2019ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?\\n- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This\\u2019ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.\\n-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.\\n\\nI have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.\\n\\nSeeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.\\n\\nBe considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.\\n\\nMy real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.\\n\\nYou have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.\\n\\nFor instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.\\n\\nAn app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience. I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.\\n\\nThe travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.\\n\\nAnother problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.\\n\\nI'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.\\n\\nPeople complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.\\n\\nAlso, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.\\n\\nSo I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"I have been a gammer all my life, have owned almost every console since the Atari Pong all the way till the Ps4 and Switch, but I have skipped most Xbox' s except for the original that was given to me as a gift.\\nThis new console that Microsoft has made is in my opinion the absolute best in this generation. Spec-wise it cannot be beat and if superior to the PS5 I most respects. But when you use your series X and in conjunction with Game Pass Ultimate (GPU), it simply becomes the hands down, no questions asked, absolute BEST VALUE in gaming anywhere! Today Microsoft has also teamed up their GPU service with EA, and now we can get most sports games and most EA titles included in GPU. But you must also add the future inclusion of Bethesda and all their amazing titles from day one in GUP since MS has bought them out.\\nSo how can't you go wrong with the MOST POWERFUL CONSOLE EVER MADE and the potential of including GPU to make it the best value in gaming PERIOD.\\n\\nYes some will think that their are few titles specifically made for this new generation as of this writing, but the same goes for Playstation, and Sony changed their mind in the short term, as most titles that they have as great exclusives are also being released for the foreseeable future on PS4 as well as PS5.\\n\\nPROS:\\n- Best Value in gaming when used with Game Pass Ultimate.\\n- Most powerful console ever made (12TFLOPS - 52 CU's).\\n- Intuitive and very functional OS.\\n- Great games even for this generation like: Medium.\\n- FPS Boos feature for older games.\\n- Automatic HDR for older games.\\n- Instant Resume feature is just awesome!\\n- Great controls, I thought I would not like them, BUT THEY ARE GREAT!\\n- Minimalistic design, that goes well with anything you have already.\\n- QUIET there is no noticeable sound of fans even when gaming for hours.\\n- More available space in internal drive then PS5.\\n\\nCONS:\\n- Controllers use a AA Battery... WHY would you do this in 2021? Yes there are options, but I should not need to look for options, personally for now I went the rechargeable Energizer route, but it is a hassle that should not be present in a console this generation.\\n- No gimmicks and straightforward pure power, no you don't get resistance in the adaptive triggers like a PS5, makes it feel a bit less futuristic.\\n- Had a bug happen to me more then once while purchasing new games, got an error, so for workaround had to add to cart, go to billing address, put edit, select the same billing address and then it worked, very annoying.\\n\\nSPECS:\\n- Processor: 8-core AMD Ryzen Zen 2-architecture CPU at 3.8GHz (3.6GHz with SMT)\\n- Graphics: AMD Navi/RDNA 2-family GPU with 52 CU at 1.825GHz (12TFLOPS FP32)\\n- Video:16GB GDDR6 with 14Gbps 320-bit interface (10GB at 560GB/s allocated to GPU, 6GB at 336GB/s allocated to rest of system with 3.5GB for GPU)\\n- Die Size: 360.45 mm2\\n- Process: 7nm Enhanced\\n- Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w/ 320mb bus\\n- Memory Bandwidth: 10 GB @ 560 GB/s, 6GB @ 336 GB/s\\n- Internal Storage: 1 TB Custom NVME SSD\\n- I/O Throughput: 2.4 GB/s (Raw), 4.8 GB/s (Compressed, with custom hardware decompression block)\\n- Expandable Storage: 1 TB Expansion Card - Seagate ATM only avail.\\n- External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD - WB Black Gaming 5TB what I got for it.\\n- Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive-\\n- Performance: 4K @ 60 FPS, up to 4K @ 120 FPS, 8K @ 60 FPS\\n- Size: 301mm x 151mm x 151mm\\n\\nFinally, I will recommend this console over the the PS5, its simply a BEAST and a better value when teamed with GPU. I won't get a Ps5 for the foreseeable future at least not till late 2022, since by then they might really have PS5 exclusives that don't get. a PS4 version.\\nThe Xbox Series X is such a great console that you would be hard pressed to look it over over the hype that the Ps5 has generated because of its lack of availability. So if you like simply the best console this generation and wish to get the best bang for your buck, Xbox Series X simply rocks.\\n\\nPRO+ : The Xbox series X is also an amazing emulation system, it can run Retroarch with no hacks, with nothing weird, just look it up in YouTube and you will find tutorials. But it can do emulation like very few systems and it add to its tremendous lineup and value.\\n\\nGreat job Microsoft, you not only added a customer, but a new fan.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Step into the realm of gaming greatness with the Xbox Series X, the Hercules of consoles \\u2013 muscular, powerful, and ready to elevate your gaming experience to celestial heights! Assembling this gaming marvel was simpler than beating level one of a classic arcade game. Unbox, plug in, power up, and voila! I was transported into a world of immersive gaming splendor.\\n\\nLet's talk power, folks! With a whopping 1TB SSD, it's like having a storage vault for every gaming adventure imaginable. The 16GB RAM felt like having a brain that processes game data quicker than a cheetah chasing its prey. The console revved up like a finely tuned sports car, promising gaming speeds faster than my cat chasing a laser pointer.\\n\\nThe promise of true 4K gaming sent shivers down my spine. The graphics were so sharp, I could almost see the pixels having a party! And with up to 120 frames per second, it's like watching a movie in fast-forward, only it's your gameplay and not a rom-com.\\n\\nThe Wireless Controller is like an extension of your own hand \\u2013 sleek, comfortable, and responsive. It's like having a magic wand (minus the spells, but hey, your gaming skills might feel magical).\\n\\nThe Velocity Architecture? It's like having a gaming time machine, reducing loading times to mere blips on the screen. I blinked, and suddenly, I was in the midst of epic battles without the agony of waiting.\\n\\nHowever, even this gaming behemoth has its kryptonite. The only downside? The wallet might feel a bit lighter after acquiring this gaming beast. But fear not, for the hours of gaming joy it provides will make you forget about those dollar signs faster than a high-speed race in Forza Horizon.\\n\\nNow, maneuverability? Let's be real \\u2013 this console isn't going anywhere. It's like a monolith, firmly rooted in your gaming universe. But who needs maneuverability when you're anchored in a realm of gaming nirvana?\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Xbox Series X is a titan among gaming consoles, a symphony of power, graphics, and sheer gaming delight. It's a gaming paradise that turns button-mashing into a delightful symphony of pixels. So, grab this console, embrace your inner gaming legend, and embark on gaming adventures that'll leave you shouting \\\"Achievement Unlocked!\\\" like a boss!\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I bought this for Christmas for my son and we love it. It\\u2019s very user friendly and the graphics are wonderful. The package it came in was fun and very professional! Downloading disc games can take a while sometimes, but the system is fantastic! I absolutely adore the backwards compatibility!!! Absolute favorite feature for sure! This was the main selling point for me when I was looking into a new console to buy. I didn\\u2019t see the point in buying a PS5 if I couldn\\u2019t play the PS3 games that I currently have from my older system. At least with the Xbox series X I can still play the 360 games that I have and even buy more 360 games if I want! The memory is outstanding as well! Xbox also has a family settings app so I can keep up with the games my son is playing and how much time he logs on his system, as well as any messages from \\u201cfriends.\\u201d Definitely worth the money in my opinion. Family friendly. User friendly. Just amazing. Keep up the good work Xbox!\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Xbox Series X! The graphics are amazing, and it runs games smoothly. The quick load times are a game-changer, and the Game Pass library is a fantastic value. The library of games if compared to previous generations has been slightly disappointing but are starting to pick up. Xbox exclusive titles are great along with backward compatibility (select Xbox, 360, One games) provides a wide range of gaming options. However, the console's large size might be a concern for some users as I did not have any room on my current tv stand. Overall, it's a top-tier gaming system for both casual and hardcore gamers.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I love this console. Between the full backwards compatibility, the semi compact size, and the amazing performance, it's a great bang for buck! Much more performance than a similarly priced PC. Everything is smooth. Really worth the upgrade from an Xbox one.\",\n",

            "        \"9\": \"Delivery was fast, 2 days. Box was well packaged, sealed Xbox x.\\nSet up was simple, even for me. You just use your phone to set it up. I had a quick issue where the code that was sent wasn\\u2019t working, so wasn\\u2019t sure if it was the code, or something incorrect with my email/password. At that point, the Xbox wouldn\\u2019t let me power off using the controller, so I manually turned it off, waited a couple minutes, started again, restarted the \\u201cnew console\\u201d set up, new code that worked, and before I knew it, I was at the Home Screen.\\nNo noticeable cosmetic or technical issues. This is definitely a nice upgrade from Xbox one.\\nLove premium game pass, and the user interface is similar to Xbox one. Controller provided takes double A\\u2019s, so will buy another one with a bit more quality without dealing with batteries.\\nI used the disc drive, it works which is great, my old Xbox one blue Ray drive stopped working a couple years ago.\\nI will give an update after more use and game play, but initially, very happy to have this. I\\u2019ve held out a long time for one of these! Worth the wait!\\nUPDATE: Xbox X is great. Blu-ray drive works, love the quick resume option for games. Format is familiar like Xbox One, so not a lot of changes on the Home Screen and such. No issues playing games, watching movies, etc. very much like having this. Fun for everyone! Graphic updates are nice, however, if your using an older TV you prob won\\u2019t see too much difference. Highly recommend if your still on the fence about purchasing.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box? Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.\\n\\nYou open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it's in a treasure chest. It was great! I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console. So good job on that!\\n\\nI'm upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade. I've got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it! I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.\\n\\nAnd here it is.\\n\\nVisually speaking, I'm not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S. There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren't there before. Everything is less fuzzy. So that's good. It's just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES. Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2. But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One. The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me. I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I'm playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.\\n\\nAnd that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games. While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn't anything on the Xbox that can't be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility). With Halo Infinite being delayed, there's no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.\\n\\nWell... I SAY that but I also don't regret doing so. I'm disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice. And it isn't even the best part of the Series X. That would be the load times. With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast. I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done. This thing zips along. That also applies while you're in the game. Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly. There's a lot of power in this rectangular box. The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it's not a selling feature if you're comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.\\n\\nIt's a lot of the \\\"under-the-hood\\\" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One. The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox's back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you'll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren't brand new exclusives. I've got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now. If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service. I spent my first day just downloading everything I'm going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.\\n\\nAnd, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass. You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X. It's a good deal.\\n\\nI'm happy with my purchase. I wish Halo would have made launch. I'm also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it's worth playing. But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable. In the end, it comes down to where your friends are. Mine are on Xbox so here I am. This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I'm going to regret having it a year or so down the line.\\n\\nBut if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don't really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season. Miles Morales looks really good.\\n\\nBut if Sony's exclusives don't move you, the third party games are all multiplatform. You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin's Creeds on whatever console you manage to get. In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there's enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.\\n\\nOh! This thing also has a controller! It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller. This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version. There's a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch. So Microsoft is a little behind but it's here now! I have not used it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it.\\n\\nAnyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware. This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time. Day one, you know what you're getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.\\n\\nBut, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family's favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nFrom the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey's Cappy or Mario Sunshine's FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don't need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren't quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.\\n\\nGraphics:\\nGraphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.\\n\\nControls:\\nThe controls, for the most part, are what you'd expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn't notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.\\n\\nCo-op:\\nThe co-op mode is where \\\"Super Mario Wonder\\\" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don't receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.\\n\\nOverall Assessment:\\nSuper Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I'll update as we continue our adventure...\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Introduction:\\nAs a self-proclaimed cool dad with a lifelong love for video games, I was excited to dive into the Mario Wonder Switch Game.

In this in-depth review, I'll share my insights and experiences playing the game from a cool dad's perspective.\\n\\nGameplay and Mechanics:\\nThe gameplay of Mario Wonder Switch is nothing short of magical. It captures the classic Mario charm while introducing innovative mechanics. The variety of power-ups, from the Super Mushroom to the new Wonder Suit, adds a layer of fun and excitement.

The competitive mode is also a blast for some healthy family rivalry.\\n\\nNostalgia Factor:\\nBeing a lifelong Mario fan, I appreciate the nods to the franchise's history. Mario Wonder Switch includes various references and throwbacks to earlier titles, making it a nostalgia trip for me. It's a pleasure to share these moments with my kids and tell them about the good old days of gaming.\\n\\nReplay Value:\\nThe game's extensive content and collectibles add significant replay value. Exploring every nook and cranny, hunting for Power Moons, and trying to achieve 100% completion is a journey that keeps the fun going long after the main story is completed. It's a game that we keep coming back to, providing lasting value and entertainment.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nMario Wonder Switch is a marvelous addition to the Mario franchise, and it has certainly lived up to the hype.

            "        \"4\": \"Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.\\n\\nMy first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn\\u2019t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.\\n\\nWhen Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I\\u2019d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn\\u2019t been playing any games as of late.\\n\\nAll that to say, this game is simply wonderful. \\u201cWonder\\u201d was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.\\n\\nThe gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can\\u2019t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can\\u2019t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario\\u2019s, but I\\u2019m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It\\u2019s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.\\n\\n10/10\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"The graphics are a visual treat. The vibrant colors and detailed landscapes make every level a work of art. It's like playing in a living, breathing cartoon world, and it's utterly captivating.\\n\\nThe gameplay is where the real magic happens. Whether you're jumping on Goombas, collecting coins, or discovering hidden power-ups, it's an exhilarating experience that takes me back to the nostalgia of my childhood. And the controls on the Nintendo Switch are so intuitive; it's gaming bliss.\\n\\nOne of my favorite scenarios is playing this game with friends. It's pure multiplayer fun! Competing in challenges, cooperating on tough levels, or simply exploring together - it's a blast every time.\\n\\nThe replay value is outstanding. With so many levels and secrets to uncover, I find myself coming back for more, each time with a sense of wonder and anticipation.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Overall it's a nice game. Bought this for my kid but I play with him sometimes. Graphics are nice and Mario super powers are cool and way more that it use to be. Worlds are very elaborated and it's cool that u can add another player on the spot\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"Title says it all. This is an excellent game. It's peak platforming with a ton of charm and unique ideas.\\n\\nOne one complaint is how difficult multiplayer can be. It's definitely functional but with some stranger choices regarding who is \\\"player 1,\\\" a too-zoomed-in camera following whoever is in the lead, and stages that are affected by individual player movements, this game feels optimized for single-player. Great for a solo play. Less good for play with family and friends.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"So I have to say that I was almost disappointed months ago to learn that Nintendo was making another 2D Mario game. The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I\\u2019ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn\\u2019t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I\\u2019m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn\\u2019t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn\\u2019t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I\\u2019m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it\\u2019s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I\\u2019d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!! Get this game. You won\\u2019t be disappointed. 10/10\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"This is so fun!!! Last year I got this deep, insane itch to play Super Mario Bros. on 3DS, which is what I grew up playing. However, after digging through my games, I couldn't find it. My local game store has the game marked up so high that I decided I would rather cry and keep my money. So when Nintendo came out with this game this year, I jumped for joy. It has so many cool features, including having different gaming experiences with each character you play as, which results in essentially an infinite number of different playing experiences. So cool. Buy. It.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"I absolutely love the product. I had a spat when I got it. It didn't have a charger for the dock. However talking to Amazon Support they corrected it for me and I was able to get a charger off the store. With the Switch Oled, you not only are able to have a bit more vibrant colors, but the system itself has great battery life. I had the original switch and this is leagues better. I literally had the switch in my bed for 4 days playing off and on and within those 4 days the battery went as low as 30% and the charging happens fairly quick, not to mention you can dock it and play it while it charges on a big screen tv.\\n\\nSO IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A SWITCH IS OR HOW IT WORKS LET ME EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES\\n\\n1. theres 3 versions\\n- Switch (original one with a dock and can be played on a tv w/ a smaller screen than Oled)\\n- Switch lite (the hand held version with no dock and can't be played on a tv)\\n- Switch Oled (newest one, vibrant colors on screen, Larger screen, and has a tv dock)\\n\\n2. Games\\n- The switch is one of the better nintendo systems that have more 3rd party games on it, although the selections are smaller than the Playstation and Xbox, the switch gives you versatility to not only bring it with you on the go to play games, it gives you the action to play with multiple people by separating the joy cons (controllers) and with that you can use each one sideways as a controller allowing two people to play and with multiple joy cons you can have a session of multiple people.\\n\\n-It has both digital and cartridge games. the cartridge games are very small, and they also have a fast install time. The games are very fun to play and have lots of multiplayer options. No full VoIP on the system but they have an app for cellphones to use.\\n\\n- the store usually has great deals on titles as most of the cartridge games cost full price or barely have anything discounted at places like Target, Walmart or Gamestop.\\n\\n3. How they work (docked versions)\\n- a docked Switch connects to the TV, it allows the device to charge and you can play games as it charges on the dock.\\n- it has a tabletop mode where you can play games on the screen as a tv. In other words you can still use a controller but have the tablet part standing upwards as you use a full controller to play on it.\\n- Handheld is where the Joy cons are attached to the tablet and you use it like a handheld or similar to a gameboy or something in that way.\\n\\nPersonally it's worth the money and Nintendo has usually very good systems that last a long time. Although they might not be the best graphically they have some fun family friendly first party games.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"First, to be clear, I play exclusively in handheld mode. (No proper technophile allows a video game system to be connected to their 4k tv if it does not output 4k. LOL!) I am also a console (Xbox) gamer and have been playing video games since the mid 1980s.\\n\\nWith that being said, this device is shockingly awesome. Why? You can basically play games with the graphically fidelity of almost (but not quite) the Xbox One/PS 4 in your hands. This blows me away. The fact that I can play NBA 2k, FIFA, Need for Speed, Grid, Mortal Kombat, Puzzle Quest and so many other games on the go is truly a joy to behold. As a result, much to my surprise, this has been the console I have ended up playing the most. It's easy to see why - I can take it with me wherever I go. I travel for work and personal reasons. This is with me and I can continue playing my games on it. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy my Xbox experience and still play PC games as well. They are awesome. However, I notice I play this more because it can be on an airplane with me, in the bed, during lunch at work, when I travel, etc. Then, sometimes when I get home, I may want to continue my gaming. So it is racking up more hours than my Xbox and PC (which I certainly still enjoy).\\n\\nThen, the OLED screen is gorgeous. I had an original Switch. I absolutely love this screen, the brightness, sharpness and clarity. Some games look totally different. If you already have an original Switch, if you can, sell it (or give it away) and get this one. I absolutely love it. I even bought a 512GB micro SD card. I am in a form of gaming Nirvana. You will really enjoy this model.\\n\\nFinally, I do think that Nintendo is in a truly awesome position with the Switch. I am not sure if Nintendo even realizes how close they are to dominating the video game market for decades. Why? Think about it. As of January 2022 the Switch is the leading console with over 100 million units sold. It really, at this point, needs one thing to finish off the competition for decades. What is it they need? Just a little more power. If Nintendo creates a device that has the graphical and processing power of an Xbox One/PS4, can do 1080p in handheld mode, with a 7 inch OLED screen, (and 4k when docked) Nintendo will rule gaming for at least a decade. Why? 1080p on OLED, at the handheld distance from the eye, appears almost as detailed as 4k at a tv watching distance. With the processing power of the Xbox One/PS4, developers can bring tons of more of their best games (triple A titles) to the Switch. So, a Switch that powerful, with a large number of triple A games on it and with a screen that good in handheld mode, the Switch's market share would crush the competition.\\n\\nAt any rate, I digress. If you are considering this device. Get it! Period. The build is so awesome on this variant. You will love it.\\n\\nI have to go now. I have to play my OLED Switch - LOL!\\n\\nAlso, the delivery from this seller was also good. It came ahead of time.\",\n",

            "        \"4\": \"I love my switch. The graphics run much smoother on OLED. It was totally worth the purchase! If you\\u2019re going to buy a switch, go all the way with the LED. I own all 3 versions, the original, two lites and the OLED and I love the OLED the most! Quick delivery, brand spanking new. If you\\u2019re going to get one be mindful of the country you buy it from, as it will impact you. Meaning, you don\\u2019t want a version not made for USA if you live here as the charging components will not work. Outside of that you\\u2019re good to go!\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I think the screen itself improves the playing experience so much compared to the first switch model. The screen is what you would expect of an OLED screen nice bright deep colors with true black. Battery lasts 2-3 hours but i've only tested that with Animal Crossing New Horizons. I enjoy watching youtube on here as well. Dock modes work perfectly fine as well!\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"This moderate upgrade of the Nintendo Switch is definitely worth spending an extra $50 to get if you are already in the market for a new Switch. The most important question though, is if it's worth it for the people who already own a Switch. This depends a lot on personal preference as well as how old your current switch is (and if you own the original HAC001 from 2017-2019 or the V2 that released in late summer of 2019). I mostly play in handheld mode because that is what this console excels at, for playing on a TV/Monitor, there are plenty of better options.\\n\\nSo what do you get with this OLED model? You get a larger screen that is OLED instead of IPS LCD. This is the type of screen that most iPhones have used since 2017 (and all of them use it now except for the SE2). You get a better contrast ratio, meaning deeper blacks and brighter colors/whites. There is no HDR support like Dolby Vision or HDR10, but it still looks leagues better than all the other Switch models. The smaller borders around the screen make the device look more modern and it's the size they should have gone with from the beginning (even if the logistics of using OLED wasn't feasible in 2017). There is also improved speakers, they do sound better and make the games your playing sound larger and more immersive. It's not as big of a difference as the new screen is to the old screen, but it's still a good thing to include.\\n\\nAnother new features is a better kickstand that is more like that of a Surface Pro tablet, allowing the Switch to be able to lean all the way back and be much more sturdy while doing so. This isn't really important unless you play in tabletop mode, but this is more realistic of a way to use this console with the screen being just that much bigger, I could see myself using a Pro controller and sitting the switch down for certain types of games.\\n\\nThe last difference here is the dock, which has a built in Ethernet port, which you should really use if you have the option to go wired. Unlike in the previous model \\\"regular Switch\\\", a wired connection is basically twice as fast as using standard WiFI, before it was only about 1.5x as fast. It still is unfortunate that you cannot achieve 100Mbps download speeds, but 60-65 is better than the 40-45 I was getting on my older model.\\n\\nIf I had to oversimplify who should buy the OLED model, I would say that these two types of people should buy the OLED (even if they already have a Switch Lite or V2) It would be: techie people who are nerdy about their tech and want the best they can get (even when they don't need it), and serious gamers who sink hundreds and hundreds of hours into playing the Switch in handheld mode.\\n\\nAlso, I don\\u2019t know that we need to specify this anymore because the switch OLED has largely been in stock since early January. But I did not and would not pay one penny more than $350 (plus tax) for this console. I think it\\u2019s worth that price if you love Nintendo characters/games, but I don\\u2019t think the hardware is worth more than $400 and the tax gets it pretty close to that.\",\n",

It gives personalities to icons like Peach and Bowser.\\n\\nThis is the game that introduced various features of these characters that we would go on to see in later games, especially stuff like Peach being equipped with umbrellas and frying pans, or treating fireballs as sort of a default power that Mario has up his sleeve, even without picking up a Fire Flower (as we see in Super Smash Bros).\\n\\nThis game also introduces a number of unique new characters who are absolutely fantastic, and deserve to be in dozens of more games.\\nGeno, Mallow, Croco, Booster, Johnny, etc.\\n\\nIn a year when The Legend Of Zelda:Tears Of The Kingdom came out, Super Mario RPG's remake ended up being my Game Of The Year.\\nAs great as TOTK is, and as much crazy big ambitious stuff and complexity as it rings to the table, it falls faaaaar short of achieving its true potential, and there are huge swaths of that game that feel lacking and incomplete.\\nSuper Mario RPG does not have that problem for even a second.\\nEverything in Super Mario RPG feels like it is living VERY close to the maximum potential of the Mario franchise.\\nEvery second is fun. Everything is interesting. The whole world is full of stuff to find and do, and people to talk to, and silly jokes and gags, and interesting little story bits.\\nHow many dungeons and boss fights are there in Zelda TOTK?

There are cutscenes that add more to basically all of the characters, the updated graphics keep all the charm of the game's style while looking great, and the ending cinematic made me smile like a little kid.

The game looks fantastic and plays true to the original. The plot and story are much more complex compared to typical Mario saves Peach games. The characters are extremely unique and bring a whole lot of personality to the Mario world and characters we love. It is not an open world game, but there are still quite a few areas to explore with secrets and treasures to find.\\n\\nGameplay: The fight sequences use a turn based style where the three people in your party take turns to attack before your enemy (s) will have their turn to counter attack (simple explanation of it). The turn based style can be repetitive and boring if you are not accustomed to this gameplay or looking for something more fast paced.\\n\\nGameplay: This is an RPG so you do gain experience points as you slay enemies and level up your party members. When you level, you will have 3 options to pick from: physical attack/defense, magical attack/defense, or health/hp. Whichever you pick, the stats within that category will increase. For an RPG, it is a very simple leveling system and easy to understand without getting overly complex.\\n\\nMy experience: Personally, I played/beat the original SNES countless times and was able to beat this remastered version to 100% within 12 hours\\u2026 but again, experience was on my side. I would say for someone new to this, it could take them 10 - 20 hours - a shorter and easier RPG with a captivating plot.\\n\\nFinal thoughts: It is an easy RPG for experienced players but you play for the story (or nostalgia), not the difficulty. If you are looking for a good, easy introduction to RPGs, this is a good game to start with for not being overly complicated. If you do not like turn based attacks, RPGs, or just looking for a typical fast paced challenging Mario game, this is not the game for you.\\n\\n5 stars for a 1-1 remaster of the original (with additional, new gameplay content) and what I expected the game would be.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"This was my first RPG I remember playing back in 1996. It launched my love of turn based role playing games. I think I beat this game a few dozen times on the Super Nintendo when I was 12. I have very fond memories of this game. So when I heard it was being released on the switch I was very excited.\\n\\nI broke one of my cardinal rules of game buying with this. I pre-ordered it. Nintendo rarely has launch issues with games but I still try to avoid pre-ordering games. But I couldn't help myself with this one.\\n\\nThe game is excellent. They upgraded the graphics which may have taken away some of the charm of the original but I think it looks great. They even kept in the 2d OG mario Easter Egg in Boosters Tower, and pixelated Culex boss. The game play was exactly as I remembered it and still a joy to play.\\n\\nNintendo made a few quality of life improvements to the game. First they created a Breezy mode which makes the game just a bit easier. It lifts the item cap, makes the timed attack window larger and more forgiving, and makes the enemies easier (I have my 6 year old playing on this setting).\\n\\nOther QOL improvements include adding an icon to help with timed attacks. A chest in Mario's house to carry extra items where in the original they would just be lost. The game now auto saves pretty frequently (usually as you enter a new area), so you don't have to search out a save location. They also added a upgrade to the signal ring that makes it easier to find hidden treasures, that can be acquired later in the game. They also added post game play, making the bosses more challenging and adding new weapons and gear.\\n\\nMost of the online reviews to this game forget it's an introductory RPG meant for children. They nitpick and complain about the lack of challenge. Super Mario RPG is a fantastic game that will take around 13 hours to beat, but it's a great 13 hours. If you played this game in the 90s get it. If you have a child and are looking to get them a forgiving turn based RPG to learn, get this game. If you are looking for 13 hours of fun without the grind of games like Final Fantasy, get this game. If you want a challenging grueling slog that will take hours off your life and leave you angry most of the time, get Dark Souls.\",\n",

Simply put, this game is the best remake that I have played in the past couple of years. It has so much love poured into it, every detail that I expected to be here from the original game is here- and additional content. I was incredibly scared that the hype for this game was going to end up causing it to be a bad game, but that is not the case.\\n\\nThis is a fantastic game that caters to both fans of the original game and those who are wanting to get into RPGs. I have seen several 1 star reviews, and to be completely honest those reviews seemed to have come from those who have never played an RPG before and expected simply another Mario game coming into this. I can't think of anything that this game doesn't improve upon from the original game. The RPG mechanics are engaging, even difficult at times with having the player time certain actions within battles to drastically change the gameplay. However, it does a fantastic job with the ! indicators telling the player when to properly time their button presses.\\n\\nThe story is of course a remake of the original title on the SNES, however I believe that its humor still stands today. I can't really say many games today make me laugh the way they intended or at least without a slight awkward feeling at a forced joke, but this game actually makes me smile more often than not. This game has some seriously funny moments, and the modernized visuals make scenes much more entertaining.\\n\\nThe only negative element I can even come up with for this game is the slight frame drops when the scene gets too intense with effects and too many models. Aside from that, the game runs at seemingly a solid 60 fps, with 30 fps for the cutscenes. Aside from the random moments of lag, the game is beautiful and runs fantastic.\\n\\nI without a doubt recommend this game.\",\n",

            "        \"9\": \"The problem with remaking video games is the design philosophy around what a remake should even try to accomplish. Video games just don't age as well as products from most other mediums. True, I love video games and they are my favorite way to pass time, but game mechanics, graphics and interactivity can resonate with older audiences that hadn't encountered them before while newer ones will often at best find them quaint and others find them cumbersome. Should a remake essentially tart up the aesthetics and keep the core gameplay the same, winning over the original audience but potentially losing the new? Or should a remake shake things up, evolving what was rusty from the ground up, risking the loss of what made the game special to begin with?\\n\\nSuper Mario RPG is unabashedly in the first camp. It is very safe. It introduces some minor mechanics like the triple attacks that don't factor much in moment to moment gameplay at all, and adds some boss rematches and such. It sticks close to the original, remaking the graphics and music but not really shaking up the script, the general story, the turn based gameplay or the bad platforming (for a Mario game, even an RPG, that's honestly a serious flaw for a game with a lot of it).\\n\\nSpeaking as someone who has always had a fascination with Super Mario RPG, but never played through it entirely, this remake gave me my fill. I still prefer its successors; the first two Paper Marios are simply tighter, more engaging experiences. Regardless, this game is funny, quite charming, and has lots of cute metagame moments, like a boss that literally disables your attack options (novel for 1996). I do think it loses a bit in the jump to 3D; the original 2D, chunky graphics were beautiful and strange and compelling and gave rise to many memes because of it. The remake looks good but in a bland way, not blocky and puffy like the old sprites but losing a bit of their memorability. The music is of course fantastic. Yoko rarely misses.\\n\\nIt's a strangely unbalanced experience, in terms of pacing. Some stars are found much quicker than others, and a decent amount of the story feels like padding, albeit amusing padding. The final area(s) feel rushed and the finicky imprecise jumping controls I feel really falter here.\\n\\nIf it sounds like my review is a little harsher than kind, it's because I hadn't grown up with this game and I'm approaching it as an N64 kid playing it for the first time being almost in my thirties. People who played and loved the original will have plenty of fun seeing what was changed, reliving iconic moments and so on. In all honesty it's a good game, and still worth playing. All Mario RPGs, and even many RPGs in general now, borrow a lot from this game and that has to be acknowledged. It's influential for a reason; the people at Square clearly loved making this game, and that rubs off on the player. I just wish that reverence could factor into bolder gestures toward making the game fresher over 25 years later, and by not charging full price for what is nearly the same amount of game content from '96.\\n\\nRecommended if you like Mario, easy SNES RPGs, and big Yoshis, and especially if you like all three.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"This is nearly a 1 to 1 remake of the original Super Mario RPG game. The music remaster is beautiful and you can even opt for the original soundtrack in the settings. But the remaster of the music is so good you may not want to. All the little things you may remember (if you played the original) are still there. The hidden block you only have one or two opportunities to grab in the Mushroom Kingdom... Link and Samus snoozing at the inn.\\n\\nWhat they did is they recreated the entire game with updated HD graphics. But kept Mario's pudgy little design the same. The \\\"cutscenes\\\" have been replaced with full rendered cutscenes that pan down to in game engine graphics instead of just watching in game graphics move about to act out a scene.\\n\\nThe best change though is the post game content. Rematches with all the bosses (story element explains why) and they are much tougher the second time around. New \\\"ultimate\\\" weapons post game and even some new super bosses to use those shiny new weapons on.\\n\\nThey pretty much kept the original experience until you beat the game. After that, they gave you more to chew on as additions. A bestiary. A music player. In game stats. Super bosses, rematches, new gear.\\n\\nThis is how you do a remaster. A proper remaster.\\n\\nI truly hope they use all this effort to give this game a long overdue sequel. Because it is one of the best Mario games out there. Paper Mario and the Mario + Luigi games can't hold a candle to this.\"\n",

Its mechanics offer immense freedom in both puzzles and combat, enriching the exploration aspect.\\n\\nRefreshing Changes\\n-While it shares the same world as Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom introduces enough modifications and new content to keep things feeling fresh. You'll often find yourself wondering about the transformed towns and the whereabouts of familiar characters.\\n\\nStunning Visuals\\n-The cel-shading style and improved lighting make the game's visuals simply breathtaking. You'll frequently catch yourself marveling at the beauty, like watching the sunset from a sky island.\\n\\nEngaging Story\\n-Though not groundbreaking, the story adds depth to the game. They've done an excellent job with Zelda's character, and it's enjoyable to connect the dots between the new events in Tears of the Kingdom and what transpired between it and Breath of the Wild.\\n\\nCONS:\\nPerformance Issues\\n-One downside is occasional lag, even on an OLED. If you have an older Switch, you may experience even worse frame drops, which can be quite frustrating.\\n\\nDisconnect from BOTW\\n-Tears of the Kingdom seems to distance itself from being a sequel to accommodate players who haven't experienced Breath of the Wild. While avoiding spoilers, the game often assumes you know nothing about the previous game, and characters act as if they've never met you before. It's not a deal-breaker but feels like an odd design choice.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Negatives first:\\nThere are a decent amount of reused themes and mechanics that I do wish they could have changed up a bit. There is definitely some repetitiveness there.\\nThe graphics (and I am not a graphics-first person...ever) are a problem here and there...I think it's a theming choice made by nintendo more than anything, but in the sky islands they add this cloudiness effect to everything (even in sky island caves) that can make it difficult to discern things. It's hard to explain, but I actually had to change my display settings to crank up the contrast (which is screwing up my settings on my other games and consoles). My kids even mentioned how hard it is to see things at times.\\n\\nPositives\\nPeople are complaining about similarity to BotW....and I don't get it. As big as the BotW world was, it feels small compared to this game. I'm about 10 hours in, I haven't done anything yet that felt like a retread (other than what I mentioned above). It has the same \\\"see something out of the corner of your eye, go investigate, and lose two hours\\\" trait that I loved about BotW.\\nThis game is much more story driven (not through flashbacks) thus far, which is great.\\n\\nSo-so\\nThe new weapons mechanics are cool...but I do miss more traditional weapons at times. So far (and this may change as I get deeper) everything I've found is stupid under powered, you always have to craft to have anything useful. The crafting/building is fun and new, but how you HAVE TO do so much of it that it can be game-breaking here and there.\\n\\nI love the game, I can't wait until I have some real time to sink a few uninterrupted days into it. It is not perfect, but I still gave it a perfect score because the fun-factor and awe of BotW are absolutely in-tact and the scale is unbelievable. The positives erase the negatives in my mind.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Stepping into a new chapter in the iconic Legend of Zelda series, \\\"Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\\\" is a masterclass in video game design. Drawing upon the rich history of this beloved franchise, this game artfully interweaves nostalgic elements with a fresh, innovative perspective, making it a must-play for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. I truly though it would just be a chewed-up and spit-out breath of the wild, its not, its better!\\n\\nWhat immediately captivates the player is the deeply immersive world, teeming with intricate details and the unparalleled charm we've come to expect from the Zelda franchise. Every kingdom, every landscape feels alive and filled with potential adventure, inviting players to lose themselves in the exploration.\\n\\nThe game mechanics remain faithful to the Zelda essence, while introducing new, cleverly designed features that elevate the overall gaming experience. It has the same shrine system as botw but new ways to work through puzzles and rewards you for being inventive.\\n\\nThe narrative of \\\"Tears of the Kingdom\\\" is enchanting and engaging, drawing you into its depths with each progressing plot point. The character development, including the evolving relationship between Link and Zelda, is genuinely touching and contributes greatly to the emotional resonance of the story.\\n\\nHowever, it's worth mentioning that \\\"Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\\\" is a game that demands time and patience. The expansive world and multiple sub-quests can be overwhelming to some, but for those willing to invest the effort, the rewards are plentiful.\\n\\nThe only slight drawback is the game's item-breaking mechanic. weapons you love will break and you will miss them. That being said just keep with it and soon you will find something even better.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"This is Link at his finest. He has really grown into the super hero role he was meant to have.\\n\\nThe story is a bit lackluster, as usual. There are lots of quests and so much content that you can spend hundreds of hours playing this, but the stories are always a little cringy and lame. It is meant to be kid-safe, after all.\\n\\nThe game mechanics are where this game shines. Zonai devices allow you to build practically any kind of vehicle you want. Like Minecraft, except that things are meant to move, with circles and everything. The physics is extremely robust. Link can engineer up doomsday devices and ride them into enemy camps.\\n\\nThe game design is beautiful, just like its predecessor, Breath of the Wild. It's the same Hyrule surface map, but there are over a hundred new cave systems, a sky island map, and a Depths map, which is sort of an Upside Down under Hyrule. I like that the devs kept the best parts of BotW and merely expanded it into a whole new kind of game.\\n\\nCombat in BotW/TotK is great, and lots of fun. Back when I was playing Zelda for NES and SNES, I never would have imagined that the game franchise would get to this level of amazing.\\n\\nThe only complaint I have is the story. There is basically no consistency between Zelda games, each one has to be taken as its own independent narrative. I know there are people who try to mesh it all together -- even Nintendo came out with a timeline once -- but I don't buy it. If their next game could be both consistent within itself, and utilize the best aspects of all past Zelda stories, Nintendo could set up future games after that for sequential story telling, and that would be fantastic. It's the only thing the game is missing.\\n\\nThis is basically a single player RPG meets Open World Sandbox. The best kind of RPG. You can follow quest lines, and there are many -- you can collect things, there are tons of things to collect -- or you can just build devices and defeat enemies for fun. You don't even have to pursue the main story line and you can still love this game. Highly recommend!!\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Where to begin with this game? Did you enjoy Breath of the Wild? Were you frustrated by certain aspects? If the answer was yes to both, you\\u2019ll love this game.\\n\\nI have been a Zelda fan all the way back to playing Zelda 2 when I was 4. And when Breath of the Wild came out, I was blown away, but also frustrated by aspects of it. Yes the game did away with most of the standard Zelda formula, but enough still remained for me to enjoy it as a Zelda game. What blew me away though was the size of the game, the focus on exploration and many other things. However, many things frustrated me like how long it took to get around, warping to shrines was easy, but losing your horse was always a serious pain.\\n\\nNow we arrive at the new game Tears of the Kingdom, clearly a sequel to BOTW that uses the same map, but manages to keep it fresh by introducing sky islands and the depths. And first off, if you felt BOTW had a massive map, this will blow you away. There is so much more to explore, but yet the game moves SO much faster by changing the towers from things you have to slowly climb to activate to just making them usually have a small puzzle to get them activated. Once you have these towers up, the game gets MUCH easier to navigate as each launches you miles into the sky where you can glide down toward the next closest one, or perhaps a shrine or other notable area. This eliminated the problem I had with horses and in fact, I barely used mine over the course of the entire game.\\n\\nThe new powers you gain at the start also open this up to a realm of creativity previously offered by other games like Minecraft, but in a Zelda game, it feels fresh. I can only say this game will feel like a dream to any engineers or someone with an interest in building. You can truly get lost in crafting weapons or vehicles, but even if only done when necessary it\\u2019s a lot of fun. I who think the shrine puzzles have gotten much harder (at least for someone like me), but they were still fun and brilliant to experience.\\n\\nFinally there\\u2019s the story. I was surprised after feeling BOTW had a very forgettable story that this had a very rich and emotional story as you learn about how Ganondorf came to power and was originally defeated, as well and the truth of what happened to Zelda after the start of the game. I absolutely love it and all the characters. Honestly, the only two Zelda games to top this for me are Wind Waker and Link\\u2019s Awakening.\\n\\nSo yes, to sum up, this is easily one of the best Zelda games of all time and improves on BOTW so much, I can\\u2019t even see myself revisiting that game now.\",\n",

Link has several new abilities (will list later) to play around with\\n\\nWorld is more expansive: There\\u2019s the Great Plateau (old Breath of the Wild map) with slightly altered environments due to gloom infection, the sky city, and the depths (huge underground cave network below hyrule). Smoke and highlighted light pillars shows points of interest in the overworld without having to look at the map\\n\\nWeapon durability is back. I know some people don\\u2019t like breakable items/weapons, but it teaches kids to be more adaptable rather than have constant/sustainable gains all the time. Also helps them be more creative in the fusing items together. Items are less scarce this time around giving you more opportunities to experiment with new combinations\\n\\nStill have freedom to be creative and do what you want.

Each one have a companion character which grants you special abilities for that temple/dungeon. Bosses at end of temples are really powerful and not just simple advanced moving puzzles\\n\\n-Menu/UI is more streamline.\\n\\nInventory tabs can be changed via L1 R1 trigger instead of thumbstick. No need to go through multiple pages to get to the next tab. Instead you scroll down if you have a lot of items\\n\\nSettings is at the end of inventory tab instead of a separate page\\n\\nAble to view recipes on sub menu for each item\\n\\n-Story/Plot:\\n\\nLink and Zelda is exploring a unknown area under hyrule castle.

There\\u2019s a huge quake and Link both get separated during the scuffle. You wake up and go on a quest to find Zelda, re-forge the master sword and save hyrule.\\n\\nStory is the most expansive than any other Zelda title focusing a lot of character development\\n\\nLike Breath of the Wild; there\\u2019s limited voice acting and not fully voiced. But that doesn\\u2019t detract from the experience\\n\\n--- Abilities\\n\\n1. Ultra Hand\\n\\nUse this to lift large heavy object and fuse them together. Can use it to solve puzzles lifting heavy objects to build bridges, ramps, ladders, etc) but also use as a vehicle creator for traversal. It\\u2019s very similar to Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts vehicle creator. Vehicles you create use fuel/battery to operate, collecting/using zonai charges refuels your vehicle giving you the ability to travel longer distances especially when creating gliders. You can also upgrade maximum battery as you progress through he game. Note that our creation despawns if you\\u2019re too far away from it, so best not abandon it\\n\\n2. Merge items\\n\\nFuse any two items together in inventory. Mainly use to create weapons with different properties (higher attack, range, elemental damage etc) and increase durability. Seeing weapon durability is back gives players ways to experiment and be resourceful with what they have in their inventory\\n\\nDuring combat you\\u2019re able to able to throw individual items\\n\\n3. Asend\\nAble to teleport to above flat platform when directly under it. Some areas are restricted if it\\u2019s too high. The cursor on your screen when using ability turns green to indicate if it\\u2019s possible to ascend or not\\n\\n4. Recall\\n\\nRewind time for a brief second. Great for puzzle solving like climbing up a rock that fell off the cliff and rewind time to ride it up\\n\\n5. Auto build\\n\\nAble to re-create previous creations you made with ultra-hand. Just have all items in one spot and use ability to re-create it instead of starting from scratch\\n\\n6. Amiibo\\n\\nSimilar to last game, you can in amiibo daily and items will fall in front of you. Amiibo give armor skins, fabrics, and other common items. No exclusive content from Amiibos this time. Able to obtain them via quests. Scanning amiibos just give you them early and more items daily. Disappointed the wolf link amiibo doesn\\u2019t give you wolf companion like the last game\\n\\n7. Camera\\n\\nBasically an ability to take pictures to fill out the hyrule compendium\\n\\nOverall extremely fun game giving you freedom to explore and be creative. Best Legend of Zelda game to date.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"The short version is that this game improves and expands upon Breath of the Wild in every possible way, with the only real con being that this game pushes the Switch to its absolute limit, and you will encounter a very occasional framerate chug. Also they took away my hearty durians!\\n\\nVast amounts of Content:\\n\\nSome were concerned when it was announced this game would utilize the same map from BOTW (its predecessor), so much to the point where it became common to see this game referred to as BOTW DLC prior to its prelease. I can assure you this is not the case. The is the game equivalent of a BMW 1M. Much how like that car was cobbled together from the BMW parts bin, but somehow became one of the best cars they ever made, this game is made with many existing assets and yet surpasses all my expectations. Not only are there sky islands, but their are caves, and an entire other layer of the world to explore (which I won't spoil if you've somehow managed to avoid spoilers for this game). There's also more to the story this time, and I swear they've at least doubled the amount of side content.\\n\\nMore enjoyable combat:\\n\\nWhile this game uses the same general combat as BOTW, what's improved is the way you use weapons. They still break if that bothered you before, but I feel far less restricted thanks to the Fuse mechanic, which allows you to combine things with your weapons and shields. The consequence of this is that you feel far less unwilling to use your higher powered weapons. In BOTW I would hoard them, and I still do a little, but I also am at least willing to use them more frequently than before thanks to the fact that I can fuse a weak little stick into something more potent at almost any time. Additionally arrows are far easier to come by, as of writing this I've been on my playthrough for maybe 40-50 hours and have accumulated 200+ arrows without really trying to conserve.\\n\\nNo hearty durians?\\n\\nOk, since I brought it up, I'll make this it's own section. At first I hated this, the magical fruit that restored so much health it was almost gamebreaking in BOTW. However, in hindsight I think it was a good call, as I'm using more of the expanded materials/recipes now and it definitely adds to the game.\\n\\nOther details and conclusion:\\n\\nI hesitate to go into further details on this as it may spoil the experience of discovery, but I can say that the staples of BOTW are still here. Shrines, resource gathering, great fairies, upgrading your armor, all still play a huge role. The runes from the first game are gone, but are replaced with quirkier and largely more useful abilities, although I do miss the bombs. But even the function of the old remote bomb can be replicated in no less than three ways, depending on the situation. I have not beaten the game, but I have spent about 40-50 hours in this world by my estimate and completed three of the four major temples, and revealed the entire main map. Yet, despite that I feel like I'm still just scratching the surface. There have still been a few new enemy types that I still have no idea how to take down, or I need to collect more hearts/better armor. There is so much to see and do in this game, and so far it's all been very entertaining. I've been playing Zelda since Link's Awakening on Gameboy Color, and although this game like BOTW diverts somewhat from the classic formula, it is definitely in the lead for my favorite Zelda game of all time, and possibly my favorite open world game of all time. Truly fantastic.\",\n",

            "        \"2\": \"I hate how my local gym canceled the Les Mills Body Combat classes on the days i can go, but I like how I can now take the classes on Meta Quest 2 in subversive VR. I work up a sweat and can choose as many workouts as I want. So I don't even miss the class at the gym being taken away! This is awesome!\\n\\nOn another note, being first submerged into the VR world, I was amazed and it took my breath away. I didn't know where to begin, but it did have a great tutorial that took place within my own \\\"house\\\" environment.\\n\\nThere are soooooooo many games and apps and things to do and see, a lot of it free, it is hard to figure out what to try and do. I love how YouTube VR has totally 360\\u00b0 videos and VR videos thar border on creepy how realistic they can be. One lady rubbed latex gloves by my ears and it felt real and raised the hairs on my head and body as she played a tuning fork while doing this \\\"reiki\\\" healing. Idk if it is real Reiko, but it felt so real, it was just mindblowing.\\n\\nAnother video showed what sleep paralysis (which I do have sometimes) is like, and while it isn't entirely what I've experienced, some parts are very much scary how real they felt, esp the end of the video.\\n\\nThere's VR social worlds, as you can design your avatar to look like you or whatever version of yourself you want to be. I gave myself purple hair! I was sad to see the skin color choices were all realistic and no green or purple or red, lol. So it sort of forces you to look like a regular person, even if you can buy cheap outfits of role play and fantasy style stuff like queen of dragons or samurai outfits. In your home, you have a mirror to show you what you look like and you can change it anytime.\\n\\nSometimes you see other people and wonder what you look like to them. But it doesn't matter. It's all fun to see other people that are real also playing games or Body Combat alongside you and against you vying for first place. It makes it more fun!\\n\\nI haven't tried the chat world's or social meetups, but I don't know where to begin.\\n\\nThis can consume one's daylight hours easily just exploring where to begin or finding favorite games to play. Some are pricey, but even I paid whatever for Body Combat, as it was well worth it.\\n\\nEverything had Bern amazing so far, and as someone with kids and taking online classes, I don't have much free time to explore worlds, and i have to watch the virtual watch on my wrist to keep track of time or set an alarm on my phone to remind me to do things before it's too late, lol.\\n\\nSo far, this has been an amazing purchase. I saw it at CostCo and looked it up and saw Amazon had it cheaper, and I could make 5 monthly payments for it, so I went with buying it on Amazon.\\n\\nYou can take photos, but I can't find them to post here. You alsoncan use your microphone to voice commands or talk to people or bots or just issue commands to change how things look or appear.\\n\\nI can't even begin to sum up how amazing this stuff is, but I did try! Worth every dollar I paid for sure. And now the Quest 3 is coming out at over double the cost. I can't imagine it getting better than this, but the headset can be stuffy esp when working out and sweating \\ud83d\\ude05 so i hear the Quest 3 will help fix that and make a thinner headset etc. And no more rounded controllers.\\n\\nYou can make boundaries for your world and be warned if out of bounds so you don't knock into things like chairs, beds, plants, cables, other stuff. And I have one set up for when I'm in bed! Some are made for lying down and sleeping. It's crazy.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I feel like the guy from \\\"Ready, Player One\\\" with this! When you put it on, time flies, so I'm glad the battery doesn't last forever (a couple hours)! It's dangerous if you're using it plugged in, because with unlimited power, you can easily stay up all night! So much to see and do, through the online web browser and all sorts of games and apps. I signed up for Supernatural and am working out every day - endless workout routines and music playlists to choose from! I also connected with a long-distance friend and had his avatar sitting in my virtual home chatting with me, and playing games with me - so awesome! Also signed up for the monthly Meta+ membership to get 2 new curated games every month. Can't wait for the mini golf next month to play with my friend! Also love the meditation apps, TRIPP, Maloka, and Liminal, and I'm not into meditating, but the music and visuals are so awesome and relaxing! A great way to get refreshed after a workout or wind down before sleeping. Options are endless on this thing and I'm so glad I finally took the plunge - well worth the money! I also bought the Kiwi Comfort Elite strap which is more comfortable and easier to adjust the fit than with the standard strap, and I got cloth covers to absorb sweat when exercising.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"I had a mastectomy and bought this as a way to help me get my range of motion back, and OMG, it is so much fun!! There's so much to do and see. I didn't realize that some of the exercise programs and other games cost extra or need a subscription, so that kinda stunk, but there is definitely plenty to do for free, including exercise! I was sweating in less than 8 minutes. If you just want to unwind, there are wonderful places to explore. One bad thing is the battery is short-lived. This saves me, otherwise, I might be on it for too long day and night. Still, a longer battery would be good. Also earbuds so others don't have to listen to our games. I can't wait to see how this gets improved upon in the future. Like how we used to have giant wireless phones at one point...lol. I'm not a huge fan of how AI is writing for us and we can't hardly tell an AI person from an actual human, but if we can keep a healthy balance of real life vs virtual reality, this could be great! Very fun, and the exercises are really fantastic. The whole thing is mind-blowing to me.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I got this initially for Beat Saber and branched out to other games. I did get an aftermarket head-strap and sport facial interface.\\n\\nDespite a very strong eyeglass prescription, progressive lenses and a pupil distance between the clicks I have clear vision in VR and experience no dizziness or nausea.\\n\\nSeveral friends have tried it and enjoyed it.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"After 2 days the band cracked and now it doesn\\u2019t work like it should . He lives it and all the features but for it to crack and replacement is 70 it\\u2019s just to much cost .\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"OMG, this is a life changer! Until this week, I haven't played video games since Atari and then later, Ice Breaker. That's it. I just wasn't interested. Then... I saw an advertisement for this product and getting fit by having fun. That did it. I put it off because of the cost but I finally got it. I am SO not sorry. Right now, I'm playing solo games (and of course, on easy mode) BUT I play multiple times a day. I love VR and I haven't experienced any vertigo or dizziness that others report. It's a little blurry because of my eyesight (farsighted in one eye and near sighted in the other) but prescription lenses are available through VR Optician so I think the blurriness will be much better once I get the new lenses. If you haven't experienced VR yet, or you want to get active without \\\"working out\\\", I recommend you give this a try. I think you'll love it as much as I do. And, FYI, you aren't \\\"watching\\\" a screen, this is a 360 degree, interactive experience. Happy gaming!\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"The storage of the Oculus Quest 2, like any gaming console, uses up a healthy chunk of its storage for required software: 11. 3GB, to be exact. Plus, it comes pre-installed with a few demos and First Steps tutorials, but those can be uninstalled if you wish, freeing up a few hundred megabytes. You get a little over 116GB of actual storage with the 128GB Quest 2, while the 256GB Quest 2 has a whopping 245GB left for games storage! Gamers who might want to be future-proof could still consider the 256GB version, but the $399 price makes it less affordable for most. The original Oculus Quest 256GB version didn't make much sense to spend extra money on because original Quest games used to average around 1-2GB in size. These days, the best Quest 2 games now hover around the 8-12GB range for many titles.\\nThe Oculus Quest 2 is very cool technology. It is not as cool as the technology in Sword Art Online, but you will not be fighting for your life while being stuck in the game. The headset is a bit on the heavy side but comfortable. The straps are quickly be adjusted front-to-back and side-to-side for the best fit. You can also use a spacer to make extra room for glasses. Most size glasses should fit fine in gear, but oversized frames will not. The hand controls are easy to learn and easy to use. The feedback is excellent, and I have not had trouble with lag. The system as a whole is very responsive. The speakers and microphone are apparent. The OS is very user-friendly, and the system walks you through many tasks when first set up. The audio controls even understand my slurred English. Speakers are built into the headset\\u2019s strap supports, offering directional left and right stereo sound. They\\u2019re reasonably clear and loud enough to get across your games' drama and directional audio feedback while keeping your ears free to allow you some awareness of your physical surroundings. If you\\u2019re playing in a room with a friend, they\\u2019ll hear everything going on using the built-in speakers, but there\\u2019s also a 3. 5mm jack if you want to connect your headphones for a private session. A decent set of stereo speakers are built into the side arms of the strap and produce immersive positional audio. If you want to be isolated, you can plug a regular set of headphones or earbuds into the headphones socket on the side of the headset, but I liked being able to hear a little bit of the natural world as I played. Definitely worth the purchase!\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Let me start by saying that this headset is really awesome for the price. There's just not any VR headsets out there in this price range, and this is a decent one by any standard. That's for sure. I 100% recommend it. My kids and I have had a blast with it. There's fun for the whole family. Even my 4 year old can sit and ride roller coasters, despite barely being able to hold the controllers.\\n\\nThat said, there are a few things that could be improved, and unfortunately the latest version of the Quest is double the price of this one (too much for my blood):\\n-Screen casting. So yesterday I had the option to screen cast to the TVs on my network. Today? Nope. Now it says to cast to my phone and mirror to the TV. Literally overnight they took away a great feature. What the heck?? I searched the internet and there are others saying the same thing. I hope they bring it back soon. It's great to share your experience with others or help your small kids through things.\\n-Weight/comfort. This thing is pretty heavy to have on your face for a long time. It can be difficult to get it to fit comfortably with the OOTB strap. They skimped a bit on the straps for sure. I've ordered a better strap and hope it helps with comfort.\\n-Battery life & charging cability. They say the battery lasts 2 hours, which I question, but even 2 hours seems like nothing on a weekend where all of the kids take turns on the headset nonstop all day. So I hooked up a 15' USB charging cord (which you have to buy seperately, mind you), but the charging is still just barely able to keep up to the power draw on a 2 amp charging block (total 10 watts of charging). So you better be sure you don't accidentally yank that USB cable out of the wall.\\n\\nI'm ordering a QC3.0 charger (a 3 amp charger) in hopes that it helps (people on the internet say it can charge up to 15 watts on the Quest 2) with a 15' cable that is rated for 30 watts to ensure I don't have a bottle neck in my cable. A 50% boost in charging speed would be great. It's a shame that they didn't design it to just use a barrel plug w/ an AC adapter, which could give you way more power than a standard USB-C connection. Plus you wouldn't have to worry about making sure you have the correct (and expensive) USB cables and adapters, which would still be the case even if they used high-wattage PD power delivery. I hate being constrained by batteries, and even more so by batteries and slow chargers.\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Spider-Man 2 for PS5 is an incredibly immersive, enjoyable gaming experience. Despite some criticism surrounding its purportedly 'woke' themes, I opted to separate my political viewpoints from my gaming experience. In doing so, not only was I able to appreciate the game, but it genuinely exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nThe narrative construction corresponds to some of the most seamless and fascinating Spider-Man adaptations I've encountered across various mediums, be it television series, films, graphic novels, or even other video games. The compelling story intertwines effortlessly with the gameplay, making it a truly gripping depiction of the Spider-Man universe.\\n\\nThe gameplay, brimming with action sequences, engaging combat mechanics, and authentic Spider-Man mobility, is yet another impressive aspect of the game. It not only offers a fun, immersive playthrough but also promises high replay value with enough content and varying difficulty levels to keep you coming back for more.\\n\\nWhile there are minor glitches here and there, they do not detract significantly from the overall gameplay. And rest assured, in their constant efforts to improve user experience, Sony will likely be implementing patches in the future to rectify these glitches.\\n\\nIn terms of graphics, the game offers rich, crisp, and detailed visuals that take full advantage of the PS5's powerful hardware. The painstakingly crafted and vividly realized world of New York City, from its towering skyscrapers to its bustling streets below, is eye-catchingly beautiful.\\n\\nThe voice acting and score further enrich the game's cinematic quality. From the spectacularly realized characters to the dramatic orchestral music, every element adds to the atmosphere of the game.\\n\\nAll in all, Spider-Man 2 is a phenomenal addition to the PS5 lineup, encompassing a potent blend of gripping story, engaging gameplay, admirable graphics, and excellent audio design. It's a well-rounded gaming experience worth exploring, regardless of your politicial stance.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Great story, great animations, great graphics. I mean this game is a huge step up from Spider-Man and Miles Morales in terms of graphics. This is like when you played beat em ups on NES then switched to SNES and the character sprites were bigger, beefier and looked so much better. That is the best way I can describe this. The addition of new traversal techniques are welcome and really add fun to moving around NYC.\\n\\nSpeaking of NYC, the map has been added to making it even more huge, they added Queens and Brooklyn and a couple other areas. I'm not from NYC, so I'm not that familiar with them. Fast travel is really cool, I mean, I'm not a fast travel person, but I had to try it out once and it's silky smooth, and there is no loading!\\n\\nThe story is great! Really tugs on the heart strings and Peter and Miles are great playing off each other. I don't want to spoil anything about the story because I went in blind and I was completely floored by the story and where it went. Just know it's fantastic!\\n\\nOverall, this is the best PS5 game this year and you should already own it. It took me about 28 hours to get the plat on Spectacular difficulty, and you only have to play it once to get the plat (but I'm sure you'll be playing it over and over). The only downside is that there isn't any NG+ stuff, like not even a NG+ mode. There isn't any reason to play this in NG+ like there was with Spider-Man and Miles Morales. Although I heard they are adding a NG+ mode by the end of the year, but I don't know why if there isn't any incentive to replay the game.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I am still exploring all the game has to offer me. But this is an improvement on the first game on many levels.\\n\\nThis time around we get to play and switch between 2 heroes: Miles Morales and Peter Parker.\\nEach of them has unique abilities. Miles has abilities that revolve around his venom abilities, and Peter relies on his gadgets which can change gameplay and keep things fresh.\\n\\nYou also have the return of side activities and pop-up crime that help you gain exp and resources to upgrade your gear and suits.\\n\\nOne new thing for traversal is gliding, you gain access to this right in the beginning which makes exploring the city so much more fun.\\n\\nStory wise it is a classic spiderman tale. I haven't played through it all but I can see a very promising setup that is bound to be a whole rollercoaster.\\n\\nDo you need to play the previous games?\\nI recommend that you at least play the first insomniac spiderman game. The game offers a recap but a lot of call backs and nuance will be lost if you hop right into this game. On the other hand, you can completely skip the Miles Morales game and play this one. The Miles Morales game is only about 8 hrs of story which this game gives you a good recap of. Plus maybe skipping it will offer some more \\\"freshness\\\" to playing Miles in this game.\\n\\nCons:\\nThis game at its core retained a lot of what made the first game great. But it can feel repetitive. Combat as usual is not so much challenging but a mashing of buttons against enemies that soak up damage to different degrees depending on how \\\"tough\\\" they are. When the game tries to challenge you, it does so by throwing enemies that block you or try to overwhelm you with numbers which after a few fights can get cumbersome. The fights are definitely more enjoyable as Miles. At least for me.\\n\\nThere is some grind to this game, but only if you want to unlock everything and get every activity done. And I recommend at least unlocking skills because otherwise, combat will get even more stale.\\n\\nPros:\\nThe graphics are beautiful\\nThe swinging and traversal of the city is fun and so spot on.\\nStory is intriguing and the character switching is fun and freshens up the gameplay\\n\\nNow, is the game worth $69.99? Sadly, not to me.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, it is a fun game and if you liked the previous games and you enjoy Spiderman/Marvel you will like this game. You have a lot of gameplay and a lot of content to find and explore but when I looked it up the campaign averages 18-20 hrs without the side activities. When you include the side stuff you are looking at 30 hrs of gameplay. Unless you pursue a completionist gameplay then you are looking at 40 hrs (estimated)\\n\\nBut the content is not enough to warrant the not-so-new price increase of video games. If you are really excited about the game, you can buy it at full price. But honestly, I would wait for a sale if you can. Holidays are right around the corner afterall.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"This is easily the best Spiderman game ever made. The story is the best Insomniac has ever written, and the characters each have an arch that develop them over the course of the story. Every character is developed and by the end of the game they are different.\\n\\nThe traversal is 2-3x faster than the first Spiderman on PS4 and Miles Morales, momentum plays a much larger role in web swinging causing you to traverse much farther and faster when it\\u2019s built up.\\n\\nThe new powers for Peter bring him up to the level of Miles with powers, and the Spider legs are also a nice addition adding new special moves that can clear out enemies in droves. The new web line lets you take out multiple enemies at once in stealth and is a perfect addition to the game. There are a substantial amount of enemies thrown at you in each fight and this makes the combat even more challenging. Enemies have new attacks that can knock you out of the air, forcing you to adapt.\\n\\nThe boss battles are revamped and boss battles require much more attention. Bosses also have health bars now which makes them feel more traditional. The new parry mechanic forces you to block attacks that you cannot dodge, adding a layer of depth to them that will challenge you more. Some attacks can only be dodged, while others can only be parried. The boss fights are also much grander in scale while also more of them are thrown at you than in the previous 2 titles.\\n\\nThe side mission in SM2 are also much better than the previous 2 games (Howard the pigeon collector mission stands out at one of the best in the game and it is a side mission). Certain crime activities feel stale, such as stopping cars and fighting arsonists, but only a limited amount of these need to be done to 100% the game. More variety in this area would be nice, but this is not that important in the grand scheme of what the game offers.\\n\\nOverall, this game is the first true \\u201cnext generation\\u201d game all around with graphics, performance, fast travel, and super fast traversal. It is a showcase for what the PS5 Was designed for, and nothing on the market quite touches the stellar 60fps with ray tracing in an open world that loads as fast as this. This is a generation defining game that will be revered for years to come.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I recently dove into the web-filled world of Insomniac\\u2019s Spider-Man 2 for the PS5, and let me tell you, it\\u2019s a spectacular experience that swings above and beyond its predecessor!\\n\\nFrom the moment you put on the Spidey suit, the upgraded graphics on the PS5 shine, delivering stunning visuals that capture the essence of New York City like never before. The cityscape is alive with vibrant details, and the fluidity of both Spider-Man\\u2019s movements adds a layer of realism that\\u2019s truly breathtaking.\\n\\nOne of the standout features is the enhanced combat system. Insomniac has managed to blend the smooth acrobatics of Spider-Man with a more intuitive combat interface. Combining punches, kicks, and web-based attacks feels incredibly natural, providing a satisfying combat experience that keeps you engaged throughout. It\\u2019s the closest I will ever feel to being Spider-Man!\\n\\nThe storyline is another highlight. Insomniac weaves a compelling narrative that delves deeper into Spider-Man\\u2019s world, introducing new characters and unexpected twists(no spoilers). The emotional depth of the characters adds a layer of authenticity that elevates the overall gaming experience.\\n\\nWeb-swinging has always been a defining aspect of Spider-Man games, and Insomniac nails it once again. The seamless transition between swinging, wall-running, gliding, and acrobatics makes traversing the city a joy.\\n\\nI also appreciate the attention to detail in the side missions and activities. They\\u2019re not just filler content; each one contributes to the overall narrative and rewards players with valuable upgrades and insights into Spider-Man\\u2019s world.\\n\\nIn summary, Insomniac\\u2019s Spider-Man 2 for the PS5 is a must-play for any fan of the web-slinger. It successfully builds upon the foundation of the first game, delivering a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and thoroughly enjoyable experience. Whether you\\u2019re swinging through the skyscrapers or facing off against iconic villains, this game truly captures the essence of being Spider-Man. Highly recommended for both fans and newcomers alike!\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"A great Spiderman game with outstanding visuals and some appreciated gameplay mechanics. The story is well written and enjoyable. Many gripes hold me back from giving this a solid 5 stars. We've seen the same moves and abilities with some fresh tweaks but over time the combat is going to feel a bit boring since it is recycled from previous games. What makes me dislike the game is the boss encounters, it's too overwhelming having to take more than 5-10 minutes to go on 3 rounds fighting the bosses. I played this in spectacular difficulty so you\\u2019re going to be sitting there for a while just to proceed through the main story. Another thing I dislike is the glitches, after installing the game. $70 is a hefty price tag when some scenes aren't rendered properly or the game just crashes because of the bugs. I've had multiple issues with the framerate frequently dipping completely taking me out of the immersion. Last but not least the story is unforgivably short took me less than 5 days to complete again $70 I would expect those hours of playing to be worth the money but to me, it falls short, yeah there are sides missions, and activities but they feel boring after a while since it\\u2019s the same thing over and over.\\n\\nI would wait for a sale if you\\u2019re looking to buy the game.\\n\\n4.3 out of 5 - Good \\ud83d\\udc4f\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"I might be biased as a Spider-Man fan since the age of 4. Which was 1982, and this game is pure superhero power fantasy excellence. I am having so much fun swinging and flying through NYC. It\\u2019s fast, smooth and slick. The same with the combat. Insomniac has really captured what you think it would feel like to be one of the Spider-Men.\\n\\nThe #1 pro for this game is the story. It is the best Spider-Man story that Marvel Comics refuses to tell. Specifically, it does what the comics won\\u2019t, and it allows Peter to grow up. It\\u2019s what the fans have mostly wanted to see with the character for years now, instead of the state of arrested development that Marvel seems to have wanted to keep him in over the past 20 years. It has solid character development, and rewards you for having played the two previous games. While Peter and Miles are Spider-Man, they are their own characters, with their own backgrounds that makes them who they are. It\\u2019s what makes this game the perfect package of great gameplay, great graphics and a great story.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"Great game. Awesome sequel.\\n\\nAbout as long as the original Spider-Man. Playing as both Peter and Miles is so sick. There's like a million different costumes. The fast travel in this game is some sorcery.\\n\\nBoss battles are the best in the series. Game gets a little tough. I'd say upgrade your health and damage abilities early. I got a buncha costumes and kinda regretted it later.\\ud83d\\ude23\\n\\nStory is solid, much like the first game. Kraven and, later, Venom make for standout villains. The biggest turn being Peter in the symbiote suit. Reminds me of the Otto/Peter dynamic.\\n\\nOnly real problems being launch day glitches. Those can solved in a patch. Also, if you don't feel like paying full price, don't. There is no shame in waiting for a price drop. 5/5\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"I was really looking forward to this game, and for the most part I got the improved gameplay I was hoping for. There are added traversal options for web swinging, and you also have web \\\"wings\\\" that let you glide all over both boroughs. You'll find yourself zipping all over the city much faster than in either the first Spider-Man, or Spider-Man: Miles Morales.\\n\\nYou can also unlock Fast Travel as before, and it is MUCH faster. No more subway cut scenes. Once you've unlocked the option for that area, pick it on the map and you're there in a few seconds, mid swing or glide.\\n\\nThe game looks amazing either in Fidelity or Performance mode. In both ray tracing is present, though of course done better in Fidelity mode.\\n\\nYou play as both Peter and Miles. Most of their supporting casts are back and I like all of those characters for the most part.\\n\\nThe one character I sometimes don't like is MJ. Most people didn't want to play as her again and instead of listening to that, Insomniac chose to give us more missions as her. They did try to make them more action oriented, but for me they came across as bit too unbelievable even for a superhero game. I was disappointed with them.\\n\\nI also felt that the writers went out of their way to malign Peter Parker, partly to help prop up Miles, which wasn't necessary. Miles is already fine on his own, he didn't need them to tear down Peter. We also have Peter doubting himself, diminishing himself at times. Once you pick up on this it tends to stick out. It's especially bad during one of the last missions. There's some dialogue that just made me shake my head.\\n\\nThere are some side missions that people have been complaining about.\\n\\nThe one mission with Miles' girlfriend, I didn't think it was so bad. It slowed the game down a bit and probably should have been optional, but I wasn't put off by it.\\n\\nThere were other missions and certain imagery that annoyed a lot of people. I don't think I should get into those here, though.\\n\\nI unlocked the platinum trophy in about 36 hours, and for much of that time I did not use Fast Travel, and I did some goofing off and messing around, not focusing on anything specific. If you're just looking to do the story, you're looking at maybe 12-15 hours, and that's being generous.\\n\\nYou don't need to play on Ultimate difficulty to get trophies or anything. You beat the game, and get the option to play on Ultimate for seemingly nothing other than the challenge.\\n\\nI enjoyed this game overall, but I worry a bit about what they will do with Peter Parker in the next game. The Wolverine game will also take place in this universe, and I worry that Insomniac is veering off course and we may get a Logan that is somewhat neutered as they prop up maybe Laura(X-23), or some other character. I hope I'm wrong. I hope they do Wolverine justice and stay focused on him and his journey, and I hope it's a violent one with nothing held back.\\n\\nIf you haven't picked up this game yet, you may want to wait for a sale. At $70, it might not be worth it to you. You'll have fun, but you'll probably put it down a lot sooner than you're expecting.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"I really enjoyed this game, yet after 100% completing the game I never felt an urge to replay it or try something within it. The story is surprisingly well-executed for what could have been messy and quite clich\\u00e9/done before. The web-swinging is leaps and bounds ahead of what it was... but, it will never quite match up to Web of Shadows for me, which had the complexity and moveset to just... you would never get bored swinging, there were always new things to try, and well, unlike turning off the swing assist in this game, it didn't feel arbitrary. I also like that it used actual pendulum physics (yes you can now do 360's swinging with a skill but it's not the same). Anyway, that aside, combat is... sigh. I feel like although some of the combat, like the L1 moves are refreshing, I find it stupid that they removed the old gadget wheel. Guys, just add the new stuff with the old stuff. Minor thing but I feel like they also nerfed the perfect dodge mechanic that would give you immediate takedowns. These might sound like minor things but they made the combat feel like annoying slogfests instead of graceful encounters where you can dispatch enemies far more quickly. I also will miss the double-takedown-per-focus-bar skill. This is a \\\"harder\\\" game than the titles before, especially if you play on hard mode, but again, I think a lot of it comes down to the features they removed instead of enemies or mechanics they added. Also, definitely not a big fan of the parry feature, like it's fine but it just doesn't belong in a Spider-Man title I feel like. Final words, you will probably enjoy this game, I know I sure did. I think 70 bucks for a game is overpriced but it's more up to you whether it's worth to wait for a sale or not. I will just say that my favorite game from Insomniac is still Sunset Overdrive and I don't think that'll change anytime soon with the corporate way they've gone.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"I recently purchased the Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller, and it has completely changed my gaming experience. As someone who loves playing games on the Nintendo Switch, I've always been a fan of the Joy-Con controllers that come with the console, but I found them to be a bit too small and cramped for extended gaming sessions. That's where the Switch Pro Controller comes in.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed about the controller was how comfortable it is to hold. The grip is smooth and ergonomic, and the buttons are placed in a way that makes them easy to access without feeling like you're reaching too far. The controller also has a good weight to it, making it feel substantial in your hands without being too heavy.\\n\\nOne of the standout features of the Switch Pro Controller is its battery life. I've used it for hours on end without needing to charge it, which is a huge improvement over the Joy-Con controllers. And when it does need to be charged, it only takes a couple of hours to get back to full power.\\n\\nThe controller is also incredibly responsive, with no noticeable input lag. The buttons and joysticks have a great feel to them, and I've found that it's made a big difference in my gameplay. I'm able to be more precise with my movements and actions, which has helped me improve in games where accuracy is key.\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller to anyone who spends a lot of time gaming on the Switch. It's a game-changer that will improve your experience and make your gaming sessions more comfortable and enjoyable.\",\n",

            "        \"3\": \"This controller is a definite must-have for a switch owner. Especially for people who have problems with the switch Joy-Cons. It's comfortable in the hands, the response times are excellent, the analog sticks are far better quality, and everything overall is far better than what you get out of the Joy-Cons. Not a single thing I dislike about it so far.\",\n",

It's a joy to press them\\n\\nI am hoping to get some money to buy another one soon :)\",\n",

I haven\\u2019t experienced drift with this controller. It\\u2019s nice to hold in your hand. It has a long battery life. It is overall a good controller and would recommend it to any casual gamer.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"*UPDATE*\\n\\nAfter a day with the controller, I decided to call Nintendo's customer support. They ran me through the typical home diagnostics (update system/controllers, perform \\\"input test\\\") and then recommended I send in the controller for repair. So I sent it in.\\n\\nWithin a couple weeks, I was opening the box they sent back, and the receipt said \\\"Service Performed: Product Replacement\\\". So I guess they just gave me a newer controller? (10 years ago I sent in a Wii, and they returned a replacement Wii, so I guess that's just how they often do it.)\\n\\nI loaded Puyo Puyo Tetris and tried out the controller in Tetris, and the dpad seemed to worked flawlessly. After playing some actual games, I feel like there is still some odd sensitivity that causes me to mess up a direction sometimes, but not like it did before. I will probably still play Puyo Puyo with the JoyCons.\\n\\nI'll leave my rating of the product at 4 stars, since it should have worked that well in the first place, but I am now very happy with my controller.\\nI might want another one someday though, so hopefully this doesn't have to happen again.\\n\\n*END UPDATE*\\n\\nAfter reading about how the corded controllers tend to have 0-2 frames of input lag, and knowing that I'd rather not play most games with the joycons, I decided to get a pro controller along with my new Switch.\\n\\nNow, the only game I've played is Puyo Puyo Tetris, so I haven't really tested all the functionality of the controller (I'll play Super Mario Odyssey soon though), so I'm not sure about the quality of the control sticks or how well the trigger buttons work yet. But here is what I know:\\n\\nPros\\nLooks really sleek ( I only see two screws; phillips head)\\nCharging cable plugs into top of controller\\nTriggers/bumpers have a bit more resistance than the Wii U gamepad bumpers, which were definitely too easy to press\\nButtons are all pretty big, including dpad\\nSmaller buttons (Plus, Minus, Home, and screenshot) are conveniently located within thumb reach\\nEvery part of it feels good to touch\\n\\nCons\\nCharging cable is USB, but only seems to work if plugged into the switch dock's USB port\\nUp on the dpad is too easy to press\\n\\nSo that last point is really upsetting; in Puyo Puyo Tetris, you need to press dpad up a lot to instantly drop tetris blocks, but there is a high chance I will drop them accidentally whenever I press left or right on the dpad. Dpad down has significantly more resistance and I will never accidentally press that. For many games this might not be an issue, but I honestly think I'll have to use joycons for Puyo Puyo Tetris. It's not horrible, but I should be able to use this controller well for any game, so there's no way I can give it five stars.\\n\\nI will also note that I prefer to grip gamecube controllers with two fingers up on each hand (i.e. one each for L, R, ZL, and ZR), but this controller seems a bit less comfortable that way, probably because your middle fingers have less leverage, since the trigger buttons are smaller and not curved. However, the buttons are positioned such that having only one finger for two buttons is quite natural (more so than with joycons). Using only your index fingers is probably more ergonomic anyways.\\n\\nOverall I really like this controller. I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I've played Super Smash Bros. Melee competitively for a long time (which means I've gone through a lot of gamecube controllers, and often cleaned them/fixed them myself), and this controller feels like high quality hardware. I'm just really disappointed about the dpad up button being to easy to depress. Maybe other people/pro controllers don't have this problem, but it seems like something that shouldn't have been overlooked.\",\n",

No queda mas de otra que tratarlo con cuidado porque he leido que es muy comun el joycon driff lamentablemente (muy mal por nintendo aca).

It doesn't feel heavy at all. I like how the facial interface, headset weight, and straps feel. I can wear the Quest 3 for many hours, maybe even the entire day. If I do feel some discomfort, I can easily and quickly adjust the headset so that the pressure points are relocated to somewhere else. But I pretty much never feel any discomfort at all.\\n\\nWhen adjusting the headset for the first time, the top strap should be adjusted first. It determines how high up or how low the headset will be resting on your head. The most important adjustment is the headset arms because it determines how clear your vision will be. You want to adjust the the top strap and position of the headset interface until your eyes are centered in front of the lenses, and then adjust the angle of the headset arms until your vision is perfect. Then lastly, the back straps will determine how snug the headset will be on your head. I have mine pretty snug but there is no discomfort. For those who ever experience discomfort, it's probably because their headset arms are not at a good angle which causes all the pressure of the headset to be on the forehead which goes numb because of lack of blood flow.\\n\\nI originally didn't care about passthrough and foolishly wished that they didn't upgrade it, because I thought that it would make the headset lighter if they didn't upgrade it and I was worried about how heavy and uncomfortable the Quest 3 would be. But it's not at all heavy and it's very comfortable. Also, passthrough is everything to me now. It let's me be entertained and productive while also being fully aware of my surroundings. Some games and apps that I have used with passthrough are Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Eleven Table Tennis, and the Meta Quest Browser (for female hologram eye candy). Three is a free AR game called First Encounters that was fun to try and which I play on rare occasions. It's a game where the walls of your house become cracked, exposing another world in another dimension, and these furry spaceball creatures jump through that world into your house and you have to capture as many as you can within a time limit.\\n\\nAnother thing that I like about the Quest 3 is that there is a smart guardian. On the Quest 2, if you step outside a small circle, you get kicked out of the app that you were using and get told to create a new boundary. On the Quest 3, I have my entire house as my boundary. Well, to be specific, I only drew the boundary in the rooms that I needed. So for me, the boundary including my living room, kitchen, bathroom, and hallways in between. It's so great to be able to walk around the entire apartment and be able to continue using my VR and AR apps with no interruptions.\\n\\nI bought the 128 GB version, and it seems to be good enough for me. If there had been a 256 GB version, I would have probably bought that, but I didn't think I would need a 512 GB version and I think that is definitely still true for me. Even as time goes by and more and more interesting apps become available, I don't think that I will regret my decision and wish that I had more memory. It's super fast and easy to uninstall and reinstall apps, so that's a way to manage memory if I start running out of room. Out of the 128 GB, 18 GB is being used for System apps, but one month later I have installed around 30 apps and games and I still have 51 GB available. Of those 30 apps and games that I installed, there are less than 10 that I want to keep installed for a while and the other 20 will eventually be uninstalled and replaced by different apps.\\n\\nI can use some apps while lying down, like Virtual Desktop, Immersed, Meta Quest Browser, and DeoVR. I love how I can see and use apps like Virtual Desktop and Immersed when I am doing exercises or I have my face buried in a yoga mat. The Quest 3 may end up being a life changer and game changer for me. It might help me be way more productive and it might make me a happier person in general. I use it for when I am walking and indoor biking and sometimes when doing exercises like pushups and hamstring stretches.\\n\\nThe Quest 3 is something that every single person on this planet should get if they can afford it. It cost me $499 plus tax and came to $533. I didn't think that I would need any additional accessories, and one month later that is still true for me. I don't need a different headstrap or extra battery packs. I just use an extension cord in which I plug in the Quest 3 wall charger and link cable that comes with the headset. The extension cord that I use is a 15-feet one that I bought seven years ago for $15 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BYC1I) and it lets me go into every room in the house without unplugging anything. I wear a velcro back brace during the day because of my bad back, and I just tuck the extension cord into the front part of my back brace. I saw advertisements for VR Covers to keep the interface clean, but even though I have been using the headset every day I don't feel like my interface has become gross or unhygienic. It still looks and feels new.\\n\\nBattery life while plugged in is good. On some apps and games, the battery level stays around the same. On other games and apps, there is a drain while the Quest 3 is plugged in but I usually play a long time and then take a break when the battery gets down to 80%. I can only imagine how many hours of gameplay I would get if I let the battery drain all the way to 5%. Too many hours. I would never play that long. I definitely do not suggest using the Quest 3 unplugged. Two hours goes by too fast, and that is two hours maximum. If you are using AR and passthrough stuff, or some demanding apps and games, it could be a lot less than that like only half an hour (or more).\\n\\nI just can't get over how great the Quest 3 is. I hated the Quest 2. I don't know what other VR headsets are like, but the fact that most of them at least 200 grams heavier doesn't appeal to me. But the Quest 3 is delightful.\\n\\nSome apps and games that I really like are as follows...\\n\\nVirtual Desktop. I prefer it over the Oculus Link. If you decide to use Virtual Desktop, you only need to buy the Quest version (don't buy the Steam version), and then go to the computer browser Virtual Desktop website and download the free Streamer App for your PC. The free Virtual Desktop Streamer App is what streams your PCVR games to your Quest headset (so you can play them on your headset), wirelessly. By the way, wireless does not have any lag or loss of performance, so don't think that you need a cable to connect your Quest 3 to your computer for PCVR gaming. It's better to use a wireless connection. It has been advised to have a good WIFI router and to use an Ethernet Cable to connect your WIFI router to your PC. I did use an Ethernet Cable, but my router is a four year old ARRIS SURFboard SBG6900AC Docsis 3.0 16x4 Cable Modem/ Wi-Fi AC1900 Router that I bought for $106 and it works well, so maybe you don't need the best WIFI routers since my router isn't that great.\\n\\nOne thing about Oculus Link (Wireless) and Oculus Link (Wired) is that they might not work right unless you go to Go to Oculus Desktop App > Settings > Beta > and enable Public Test Channel and let the app update. I don't use Oculus Link, but that is important to know so please make note of it. Some apps and games only work with Oculus Link, like 3DXChat seems to only work with Oculus Link and won't work with Virtual Desktop.\\n\\nI like using Virtual Desktop for the virtual desktop. It's easy to grab and move the desktop around. It has a headlock so it can follow your head movements or even follow you as you walk around the house. And it lets you use your Quest controller to scroll and click on things. And it works in passthrough mode. I also like Immersed because you can have up to four virtual computer screens for free (five if you log in three times a week or pay for premium). Immersed allows you to be around other users and their avatars and it also has a passthrough mode. The only bad thing about Immersed is that it's not as easy to tilt and move the virtual desktop screens around, there is no headlock, and the Quest controllers are pretty much useless when interacting with the computer screens.\\n\\nZombie Games.... I started a game called Propagation: Paradise Hotel and it's a lot of fun and very interesting. Resident Evil 4 is also a good zombie VR game. I never cared for any of the RE computer games, but maybe it's because it is a VR game or something but RE4 is fun to play. I like walking around the realistic setting. I like the scenery in RE4 better than the scenery in Arizona Sunshine and The Walking Dead. Arizona Sunshine is a decent zombie game. The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners is also a decent zombie game. It's a satisfying feeling stabbing zombies in the head with a knife in TWD: S&S.\\n\\nOther Games.... I really liked the first Red Matter game. It was awesome. But sadly it was short and doesn't really have any replay value. I'm playing Red Matter 2, but so far I don't find it interesting. Genotype is a somewhat interesting game, but I feel like the texture resolutions aren't so great. Green Hell is an interesting realistic survival game so that is worth a try too. Survival Nation is a zombie apocalypse RPG game with crafting and you can even fish. I joined a Survival Nation server once and some guy came charging towards me and then started doing a lot of sign language, trying to get me to turn voice on, and trying to get me to complete 20 things at once so that I could be quickly caught up and start co-op'ng with him. That made me feel uncomfortable so then I started playing on solo mode. But after a while I got bored with solo mode. I want to be on the same server as other people but not feel pressured to co-op with them. I uninstalled it for now, but I might come back to it soon.\\n\\nFitness Games... I like Eleven Table Tennis and FitXR.\\n\\nCustom Launchers... I recommend getting custom app launchers like Lighting Launcher to help organize your games, but also Quest Games Optimizer ($10) which lets you increase the resolution of native apps and games (not PCVR games). (Increasing the resolution of games and your CPU/GPU usage will cause a faster battery drain, which isn't a problem for me since I am using an extension cord.) On QGO, if you increase the resolution of Horizons Home, the environment and the mirror that you see when you first turn your Quest 3 headset on, there is a remarkable difference.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR goes, I haven't really played much PCVR content. I wanted to play and enjoy Contagion VR: The Outbreak, but I get too much motion sickness from it because the left joystick moves my character way too fast. There is a plugin for SteamVR called OVR Advanced Settings, but the only thing that I like about it is that you can do an emergency y-offset if your character glitches and falls through the floor. It has other features like key binding, but I don't care about changing my controller keybinds. OVR lets you change the snap rotation angle, but I don't like how it is done because you have to use buttons for snap rotation and not the joystick. So instead of tilting the joystick left to rotate left a custom number of degrees and tilting the joystick right to rotate right a custom number of degrees, you'd have to use buttons like A for rotate left and B for rotate right. Really stupid. And not only that but the dev told me he can't let us adjust movement speed, but the reason he gave me was so idiotic and seemed so insincere and untruthful. He said \\\"it will vary game to game..... additionally different acceleration profiles will have drastically different effects on your comfort\\\". It sounds beyond stupid because I was already at extreme discomfort, so being able to adjust the movement speed temporarily would have been a good thing and not at all bad. And I can always change the speed back when I am done. It's not hard to change the speed from 100% to 10% and then back to 100% again.\\n\\nAs far as PCVR gaming goes, I am using the Quest 3 with a Laptop - GTX 1650, i5-9300H, and I haven't had any problems. I mean some games are unbearably laggy and unplayable, but other games are playable. The important thing is that PCVR is an option for me and works most of the time, even though I have a weak laptop.\\n\\nI think that it is kinda weird that the Quest 2 has 85% five star ratings on Amazon, and this Quest 3 which is a billion times better has only 70% five star ratings. If you can't appreciate better technology and advancements, then go have yourself frozen for 50 years and stop discouraging other people from trying the Quest 3. Possibly the more people that buy the Quest 3 and use it, the more Meta will devote themselves to VR technology in the future. This could ensure better VR headsets in the future and maybe guarantee more Quest headsets (Quest 4, Quest 5, Quest 6, and so on). I just don't get how everyone had Pintos two years ago, this BMW comes out, and instead of being happy at how much better the BMW is than the Pinto you complain that it isn't a Porsche. Entitled much? I'm already looking forward to the Quest 4 because I hope it will have even better passthrough and better resolution.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"I had bought a Quest 2 a few months ago to dip my toes in. I used it on and off but there were challenges and it got a little dusty. It required some fiddling to really use it. The biggest issue for me was the optics - the whole reason one buys VR. Trying to hit the sweet spot, ignore god rays and just use the product made me a little nauseous, literally. It worked but overall it got sidelined due to the effort required to get everythig running. Overall a fun experience though with promise.\\n\\nI pre-rdered the 512GB Quest 3 and Amazon delivered on release day after watching some event videos. The promise of a better experience got me. I havent spent a ton of time with it, but here is why I gave it 5 stars.\\n\\n1. Out of the box it worked and optics were clear. No fiddling with it or sideloading apps. The new lenses and slightly higher resolution is very noticable. In my Quest 2, it had to be in just the right position - no more with Quest 3. Edge to edge clarity. As I mentioned, this is the main reason one buys VR, vision.\\n\\n2. I am a glasses wearer. This worked with 30 seconds of adjustment. No spacer, no headache and was resonably comfortable.\\n\\n3. I loaded up a few of my games. I was super impressed with the clarity and smoothness. Full disclosure, I mostly buy on Steam. Why? I have a high end PC and graphics card and, well, again visuals matter here.\\n\\n4. Pass through / Mixed Reality has potential. It's maybe not practical yet and a little buggy, but way better than the Quest 2. This is pretty cutting edge and I would argue pretty new. It will not be a reason to buy this headset today, but it works as expected.\\n\\nProbably my biggest dissapointment with Meta is that they used the same UI. As a developer, I didnt find it intuitive on the Quest 2 and struggles with there things are. No update at all that I can see on the 3. I get the balance, releasing a new one risks alienating the current fan base, but when you buy a new device, you kind of expect UI improvement. Hopefully they release improvements in the future.\\n\\nI see a lot of reviews already where people give less than 5 stars due to issues that if you think about it, arent really related to the product sold.\\n\\nI think the biggest downside isnt a problem with the Quest itself - just slow adoption and development in the VR market as a whole. This isnt on Meta. They are trying to drive innovation and allow developers to create more immersive experiences and have done a pretty good job at building the framework. As the audience grows, developers get on board and develop apps that can be used.\\n\\nWhere I think this shines is that its as good as much higher priced VR available as of today. I can enjoy it for a year or two until the next big VR release. I expect there will be releases that improve the Mixed Reality and UI during my time with it. The lack of headache in getting into VR and having it just work hits the target. The improved visuals make it a worthwhile investment if VR is something you are interested in. To keep it from getting dusty is on developers. I have a few games I like. Half-Life: Alyx has set a standard and shows what is possible. It doesnt feel cartoonish and I get into the environment. I got the Asgards Wrath 2 voucher with mine and cant wait to see what that looks like next month.\\n\\nMy WISH is that VR can get to the point where it can replace my monitors. Being able to spin up virtual monitors as needed for coding and being in an environment of my choosing is the dream. Steam comes close and Im sure this is right around the corner, so learning to live part time in VR now is worthwhile!\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"Simply put I was blown away by the technology. The visuals are generally sharp and crisp and are pretty mind blowing. Even just navigating the menu screens is a joy, and the fact that it registers hand input is insane. The controllers feel good and snappy and intuitive.\\n\\nBut the apps just still aren't there overall. The selection of games is still just not quite there to justify this to 'everybody', and it is still far too hard to do simple things like play 3D movies or easily navigate the web to make this a must recommend. It is also still relatively heavy on the face (though improved from previous generations). The battery life is short at 2 hours but you probably won't want to play for that long anyway given the above. The pass through is.. passable but you won't be wanting to read any screens through it and it is definitely grainy. It is also unfathomable to me why they chose to ship this without a nasal piece to block the light coming in from the bottom.\\n\\nIn short, it's the best to come so far and this tech is definitely the future, but the technology still has quite a ways to go.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"First off, I'll say that i just got this and am still testing. But so far, I am super impressed. I own an original vive that I bought day 1 and then i got a reverb g2 that I have been using until the quest 3. Both if my previous headsets were corded, limited to one area of the house, and a pain to setup and use when I wanted to play. I was using light houses as well on the reverb g2 so that I could still use my better tracking vive wands. All of it was limiting and a pain which made me end up not playing. The Quest 3 was the solution I had been waiting for!\\n\\nBeing able to do room setup in headset quick and easy is a dream come true. I was skeptical about the wireless capability for pcvr as well but I am blown away at how well it has worked so far. I've been able to play pcvr games anywhere in my house which is amazing.\\n\\nThe pancake lenses are so much better than the fresnek lenses also. I wear glasses, and the quest 3 works well with my glasses out of the box, although I do want to get some lens inserts later.\\n\\nEverything seems very polished with a minimal amount of bugs. The AR pass through which it is somewhat grainy and not super clear, it's fun and works very well. The sound is pretty amazing also for the type do speakers it has.. Not enough bass in beatsaber and it can't compare to the g2 style of speakers but very impressive for what they are.\\n\\nControllers feel nice and not cheap, track well, battery life on the controllers is good. The headset itself looks and feels pretty good. I think they should have put a nose flap on it because the only place I have lightleak is at the bottom of the nose area. The strap of course is everyone's gripe.. Yes, it isn't great.. But tbh it isn't as uncomfortable as what everyone keeps saying to me. It works but it just isn't the best.\\n\\nMy one issue, aside from this being released by a company I don't like, is that they want to nickle and dime everyone for things that they should have included with the headset or to fix issues with the headset.\\n\\nThe headset battery life is about 2 hours. That isn't long... So they sell an overpriced better elite headstrap with an extra battery to extend it to 4 hours I think. Fixes two issues by making you pay more money. Fortunately, there are plenty of aftermarket options for battery extenders and straps that are cheaper, so you don't have to spend more money on meta's overpriced accessories.\\n\\nI've seen reports of people getting headsets with dead pixels and there being quality control issues... So far I haven't noticed any dead pixels.. Im a stickler for that stuff cause my vive had a dead pixel and it always bothered me. I'll be checking closely to make sure the quest 3 is good.\\n\\nI was going to take one star off for meta nickle and diming but the headset is so good that I won't do that as of now. This may change later but it's simply the best, most versatile, most polished VR headset you can get right now for this price. I guess they kept the price down by giving a crappy strap, smaller battery, etc.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I bought the Quest 2 when it came out and was disappointed with the difficulty to maintain a good focus through both eyes, the wear on my face even after short-term use, the battery life, the overall performance (freezing, hitching , and delays while doing simple things was common), and the general lack of 3rd party support. The Quest 3 fixed almost every single one of those issues. I installed the games from my previous library and every single one of them both looks and performs better. I have yet to get it to freeze, the hand tracking is much more advanced (though still not perfect by any means), I don't accidentally knock my controllers together anymore (they removed the rings!), and it doesn't randomly fall off my head or throw its weight around when I make sudden movements. Coolest of all, the passthrough cameras seems to have an actual API now, and screenshots taken with passthrough enabled show up in the screenshots!\\n\\nIt's still not perfect, and here's the bad so far:\\n- The battery life leaves much to be desired, even with the extended battery pack. Having a long cable to stay plugged in is a must, but is a small price to pay for what you get.\\n- The pancake lenses are REALLY nice, and the quality of the cameras with passthrough enabled is second to none right now, however weird distortions will happen when any of the cameras is obscured. These typically only occur when you're really close to something, but it makes using passthrough with 3 computer monitors in front of you a pain (which wasn't ideal in the first place, but still!). This is really odd to me given that this headset was supposed to be designed with AR in mind, yet the headset seems to fail to process peripherals quite so correctly with only a minor obscurity to one of the cameras.\\n- I've heard complaints about audio sounding weird in games like Beat Saber. I've played other games, watched videos, and joined Discord and Telegram calls (through their browser apps, there's still no dedicated app) with no issues.\\n- 3rd party app support appears to be identical to that of the Quest 2. Facebook/Meta seems to be hellbent on keeping a monopoly on their services by refusing to provide support to other \\\"competitor\\\" platforms and services.\\n- Defining a room scale boundaries is still a bit wonky and it's clear that it uses shades of colors to help determine distance to things as my flat wooden floors are sometimes detected as being higher than the rest where the color shifts. I think this model must have been developed with carpet or other environments where there isn't normally a sudden change in color/tone. So far this has been a non-issue, but I have yet to use any AR apps where I may notice a difference.\\n- The distance between the lenses is now adjusted by a single dial. While this definitely feels much more elegant and is better adjustable than those on the Quest 2, I struggle to get my left eye aligned with my right, so one eye always sees clearer than the other.\\n\\nIf you're still on the fence about getting one of these I would still recommend it 1000% despite the flaws. At the same price point of the 2 when it came out it's still a steal when compared to headsets by other brands and its own predecessor.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"I have always dreamed of ditching my monitors and having just a VR desktop. I could work much more relaxed than hunched over a monitor, with my shoulder muscles cramping after a day of work. I already use my laptop to work anywhere in the house, but that freedom limits me to a single screen. Note that I am a software developer by profession, and I typically spend 10 hours a day coding.\\nI was actually very skeptical that I could do real work in text editors with this thing. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am very glad I did, and here's my take after 2 full days of use.\\nFirst, my setup: I use the Immersed app over wifi with my Windows 11 laptop. I work tethered with a 10 foot usb cord for power only, with a 30 watt aftermarket charger, which can charge the headset while still keeping it powered up indefinitely. I started with the 3 monitors free Immersed gives you, but cut down to 2 to feel less cramped by displays. My coding is done in Eclipse and VScode, and the text is very legible. I was worried about the field of view, but it is absolutely not an issue. The pass through portal in Immersed is great to allow you to see your real desktop, with your keyboard and coffee, while the rest of your environment is some chalet in the alps, or a space station, or whatever. You can also work within your real environment, but with virtual screens floating in front of you, if you want (see my comments about passthrough further on).\\nThe first day was fine except after the first 8 hours my face started hurting because of the pressure needed to keep the headset in place. I powered through the discomfort and after the 10th hour it wasn't bad anymore. Today I added a counter balance velcroed to the back strap and it has been MUCH better. I can loosen the strap so it doesn't press the headset against my face, but it stays perfectly in place due to the added rear counterbalance. I do not feel the that extra weight, only the benefit of the lighter fit on my face.\\nHow about my eyes ? You may not believe it, but after I spent many hours with the headset, my eyes are actually relaxed much more than when using a monitor. I've been far sighted (had Lasik many years ago) and use reading glasses for normal work, but do not need glasses with this headset. Make sure you tweak the interpupilary distance adjustment as well as you can for yourself to avoid eye strain. I believe that I may have a slight difference in strength between my eyes that strains them with regular monitor use, but with the Quest 3 and that adjustment, my eyes feel very fresh even after 10 hours of use.. Incredible, I know. Perhaps if you have perfect normal vision, you may have issues with using the headset, but for me it's improving my experience. On top of allowing me to stay relaxed in my easy chair when I work. It's only my second full day, and if my experience with comfort changes, I'll update this review.\\nSome things to watch for. I've had to reset it maybe 3 times these past two days, with a combined 22 hours of use. One time because I started getting some strange glitchiness, like streaks of gray fuzzy lines crossing my field of view all over the place, or voice command errors popping up continuously when I didn't even use it and had turned voice control off. The restarts cleared things up. One annoying thing is that though the computer speakers can play through the headset, you cannot use the headset microphone through the computer, for example in meetings or chats, so I have to keep the laptop very nearby so its microphone can pick me up. I'm sure that will be solved in a future update.\\nThe passthrough cameras work, you can see the outside world enough to do what you need to do, but not very clear by any means, especially if you're not in a well lit area. This is super minor issue for me, since the virtual monitors is all I really care about, and they are quite crisp.\\nMy big fear is that the headset was not meant for such intensive daily use and that it may die out on me. I guess we'll see if the Meta warranty is any good if that ever happens. I'm debating purchasing the supplemental 2 year warranty that is available to get within 60 days of purchasing the headset.\\nOne last note, if you want to try a very cool experience to get a taste of VR, I highly recommend the free Oculus First Contact app in the store. A fun but very well done (imho) demo of what you can do in VR - great for all ages.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"I recently purchased the Quest 3 from Amazon, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with both the product and the service I received. From the moment I placed the order to the moment I started using the Quest 3, everything went smoothly.\\n\\nFirstly, Amazon's delivery service was impeccable. The product arrived well-packaged and on time. I was excited to unbox it, and the Quest 3 looked even better in person than it did in the pictures. Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the Quest 3 itself. This VR headset has exceeded my expectations in every way. The graphics are stunning, the sound quality is exceptional, and the overall experience is incredibly immersive. Whether I'm exploring virtual worlds, playing games, or watching videos, the Quest 3 delivers a level of immersion that is unparalleled.\\n\\nThe tracking and responsiveness of the controllers are spot-on, making every interaction in the virtual world feel natural and intuitive. The freedom of movement without any wires is a game-changer. I love the fact that I can move around without any restrictions, making the VR experience truly immersive.\\n\\nAdditionally, the library of games and experiences available for the Quest 3 is extensive and keeps growing. There's something for everyone, from action-packed games to relaxing simulations. The Oculus Store is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the variety of content that's available.\\n\\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Quest 3 from Amazon. It's a fantastic VR headset that offers an incredible level of immersion, and Amazon's service made the buying process a breeze. If you're considering getting into virtual reality, I highly recommend the Quest 3, and Amazon is the perfect place to buy it. I'm looking forward to many more hours of virtual adventures with this fantastic device!\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"I apologize now, for this review being so long, & all over the place, but I always give honest & THOROUGH reviews that you can 100% trust... I'm never paid to review anything).\\n\\nPreface: So I've had my Quest 2 for 3 years now, & absolutely LOVE it. VR has changed my life for the better in so many ways. The app Horizon Worlds has brought so many great friends into my REAL life, and has given me AND my 27yr old, disabled daughter so many things to play, explore, & experience! I'm 55 lol and I'm an Beat Saber (VR) addict. I love music with a good Beat which is what drew me to beat saber & I can't believe how far I've come playing it! I've played it every single day since the day I bought the Quest 2, 3yrs ago. So I can honestly say that I DO know what I'm talking about here.\\nThe Q3 does NOT track as well as the Q2 while playing at Expert and E+ levels. I noticed it immediately. If you don't play Beat Saber at at least expert level, you probably wont even have tracking issues.\\nI was told by so many ppl the Q3 was soooo great. Which, it IS great when comparing to my now 3yr old Q2, that I've played 4-8+ hrs DAILY for 3 yrs. I've gone thru 3 sets of controllers, put a few little scratches in the lenses, & it starts to heat up after an hour or so...& when you already have hot flashes, it feels like wearing an oven on your face. I guess it's because it's a more powerful headset. I still don't see that much of a difference visually... certainly not enough to justify paying double what the Q2 costs!\\nI also love a social app called VRCHAT. The movie theaters are unparalleled, and the visuals in there are jaw dropping...especially if you connect the headset to a good computer...(which i dont have) But vrchat now requires much more RAM than the little 6gb the Q2 provides. VRChat requires at least 10-12 gb of RAM to see all of the benefits .. I was hoping the Q3 would have at least 10-12gb of RAM, but it only has 8gb! ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr\\nSince my Q3 is NEW, of course it's doesn't heat up .. yet.. we'll see! The battery only lasts 2 HOURS, so you have to stay plugged in if you want to play for longer periods. (*tip if you arent rich lol* Instead of spending extra money on fancy headgear with built in external batteries that only last another 2 hrs) I use my 20000 mah power bank and attach it to the straps behind my head using velcro straps. It not only counter-balances the headset perfectly, making it less heavy on your face, I have yet to play long enough to wear out the power bank! My longest time in the Q2 was 9-10 hrs with still 20% battery left as well as 2.5 hrs on the headset... (don't judge lol I lead a very boring life lol) The Q3 does pull a lot more power..but it still outlasts me lol.\\nYes, the Q3 visuals are slightly better (clearer & brighter), but STILL not $300 worth better. I'm still debating whether or not to keep it or return it.. but for the Q3 price I could get 2 new Q2s! Or just get a new Q2 for $400 plus 3 extra sets of controllers! My Q2 had 256gb storage with over half used.. so of course I couldn't get the cheaper one that only had128gb!! Good job META you really know how to make your money...Grrrrrrrrr!\\nHowever, I now have a headset with 512gb, and access to games not available on the Q2. I'm also afraid of Meta slowly fazing out the Q2 like they did Q1.\\nI haven't tried any mixed reality using the passthough, so I cant review that part, but the Q3 pass-through is not what they show it to be at all. It's more like trying to see under water. At least it's in color now. I'm not a big fan of mixed reality. I'm in VR because it feels like it takes you away from the real world.. like a little vacation with friends without spending money or getting dressed up or leaving the house! lol I don't want to be sidetracked or reminded of what I need to do in my house LOL.\\nThe controller battery doors are much easier to remove now with a push button thing that pops it open. These controllers also have no ring, and are a bit smaller. If you have huge hands itll probably feel like they'd disappear in your hands. I still prefer the feel of the Q2 controllers, especially for Beat Saber & Pistol Whip. I require knuckle grips to play those, which were much cheaper than the Q3 ones.\\nThe Q3 will draw a boundary for you, which is great if you are only standing.. or only sitting.. I still have to draw my own since I like to sit and stand depending what I'm doing in vr... but so far, it remembers my setting.\\nThe Q3 cloth interface gives me a \\\"rug burn\\\" type rash on my face..maybe its an allergy idk. It's a weird material as opposed to the absorbent foam on the Q2, which I LOVED, because it absorbed sweat during my sweaty Beat Saber & Pistol Whip sessions .. and I would just wash it out every night with a little baby shampoo, squeeze it out & hang it to dry overnight. It never fell apart, and was always fresh & clean for the next day. Now, I have to put my old silicone cover on it, which holds in the heat in and fogs up the lenses.. (I have hot flashes 24/7 so it's not fun). (I just ordered a different interface). Or ill have to spend probably 75-100 bucks when/if they make an interface with the little fan attachment. (The one for the Q2 is awesome btw!) So farmers, not only did I have to spend over $700 for this headset with the added 3yr protection, a new interface, I also had to oder new controller knuckle grips that come attached to new battery doors. Thankfully, I had the option to make 12 no-interest payments over a year!!\\nI'm praying these controllers will not drift like the Q2. Although, I take way better care of my Q3 after the lessons learned lol.\\nThat's it so far. I'll add to this as time goes on.\\nIn closing, I highly recommend getting either headset you can afford! No matter your age!! (But please..not for kids under 13! Do your research on that!!) VR is great for socialization, and exercise!! It's not only a game changer.. its a life changer! Don't listen to all of the negative Nellie's out there who just hate the Zuck lol.. to me it has nothing to do with him. It's all about what experiencing VR has done for me & my family!!\\nPS: 2 1/2 yrs ago, while my 82yr old Dad was still alive, I brought my Q2 to him at his nursing home. I showed him so many things he LOVED IT! He loved exploring fish, dolphins , & prehistoric fish in the depths of the ocean..fed & played with dolphins .. traveled to places he'd been to while in the army, even shot virtual army weapons and went hunting! I believe they should have vr headsets available to all patients in nursing homes & hospitals..or homebound patients or whoever else doesn't have the privilege of leaving their home at will! It can breath new life into everyone\\u2661\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"So, I started with the original Oculus Developer Kit 1, then on to 2, then the consumer Rift, Rift S, Quest 2, and temporarily had a Quest Pro (a great piece of tech, but too expensive..returned in 1 week). We've come a long way with Quest 3....\\n\\n- The clarity of the new \\\"pancake\\\" lenses are a marvel after dealing for years with the now primitive, Fresnel lenses. No more having to reposition the flipping headset around, over and over just to find that one tiny spot of clarity while their outer area remains blurry. These flat pancake lenses are just super clear all around, from edge to edge.\\n\\n- The resolution bump from the Q2 is another nice welcome. The blacks are not jet black like you would find on an OLED screen (like the PlayStation VR2), but that would bring the cost up. When you're playing games or experiences, you won't even be thinking about it. Would you rather have fresnel lenses like PS2VR? I don't think so. In addition to these new features, the fieild of view has widened on Quest 3, another upgrade that makes a difference.\\n- The sound is beefier and louder. No more tin can alley like the Q2, and the fantastic spatial sound adds more to the immersion. I went back and played some older games, finding sounds that I've never quite heard on Quest 2, which really surprised me. The haptics are also very much improved over the Q2, though not as potent as I would have liked. The Pro controllers are more advanced in this department, as is the PSVR2.\\n\\n- The controller wrap around rings over the hands are a thing of the past, and good riddance. These controllers feel great, and track without a hitch. I'm super glad that they are sticking to regular AAA batteries for the controllers. They last a sick amount of time, as opposed to the Quest Pro controllers which are rechargeable. Some people prefer that style, but I prefer having to simply replace batteries and continue playing, rather than waiting for yet another device to recharge Plus, I remember getting overheating warnings with the Pro Controllers, and they never felt warm. If you didn't put the controllers down for a bit, the warning would not go away. There's a number of complaints about this odd issue in the Oculus forums. Not sure if they fixed this by now, but I do remember the Oculus mods being dumbfounded by this ordeal.\\n\\nThe Mixed Reality / Passthrough\\nAs someone who's been around the tech industry for over 35 years, this is a new level of entertainment. Mixed Reality puts virtual objects right in your real space. Imagine sitting on your couch, viewing your entire room, while watching a spaceship break through your ceiling and land on your couch. Following that, you'll view in amazement as alien fuzzballs start breaking apart the walls to your surroundings, trying to get in, while revealing a complete alien landscape as you race to catch those critters with the supplied blaster as they pop in and land on your floor, and furniture! You have to see it to believe it. You're still in your room, but now all the walls have been blown out. This all works convincingly thanks to the new room scanning feature, which is something right out of the Matrix. You simply walk and look around your room(s) as it automatically detects walls and obstacles during setup.\\nHow about playing a dungeon crawling board game ON YOUR ACTUAL TABLE, or break into a sweat as zombies smash through your doorways, and climb in from the windows. If that's too much, then why not set up a giant TV screen that would dwarf the real TV in your room. Dozens of games and apps already have been updated to support mixed reality, so there's already many things to try out. Every day seems to bring more.\\n\\nThe beauty of Mixed Reality is that you're not fully engulfed in Virtual Reality. You're still seeing all of your real world, but the virtual stuff comes to you! This is a wonderful way to introduce newcomers to VR who may not feel comfortable completely cut off from their surroundings. So, now you can exercise with a virtual trainer, box against a computer opponent in your own living room, or explore your house which can be haunted with ghosts. All this can be done without worrying about kicking your dog, watching if your baby wanders away or smashing your skull into a real TV set. One other advantage, it cuts down the possibility of motion sickness which can be a problem for certain people. The one big complaint about mixed reality - the passthrough is kind of fuzzy, so your real world has kind of a grainy film over it, and when combined with the stunning virtual objects, there's a stark difference. Good lighting helps the situation, but ultimately, it becomes a non-issue because once your play area is combined with the virtual world, you won't even be much concerned about the quality; your room becomes the backdrop as your eyes are mainly focused on the virtual parts, leaving the whole mix to be quite convincing, and for this price point, to have this feature? Are you kidding me? It's amazing!\\n\\nOf course, you can alway play in total virtual reality, because that's still the popular choice for hardcore VR enthusiasts. Speaking of which, I've seen many comments on various forums where VR veterans were knocking mixed reality, saying things like \\\"who wants this? I don't need mixed reality, I will only play in complete Virtual\\\". After a few days, I already saw a change of heart. Now it's, \\\"oh wow, I never thought I'd get into this, now I want more!\\\". Yeah, mixed reality is here to stay and grow.\\n\\nThe comfort\\nWell, here's where I personally find a negative. The default strap provided with the Meta Quest 3 is similar to the strap on the Quest 2, however, this has a bit more stability, with its adjustable Y-shaped back. It's one of those things, you try on, and think - oh, this isn't bad at all, only to find shortly after, either your forehead, cheeks or both feel a bit too much pressure. It's not as bad as the Quest 2, as the Quest 3, doesn't protrude as much, due to its new design, but it's no way good for long play sessions. I simply purchased a 3rd Party Elite-style strap on Amazon.. so mission accomplished there as it's a very comfortable, halo-style ($37.00) which is the way to go.\\n\\nBattery life\\n...is still short - around two hours, though some complained it's even shorter. I tend to use an ultra-long C cable plugged into an Anker power supply and I can go all day, and only take it off if I'm playing something like Beat Saber, or anything else that requires a lot of crazy hand movements.\\n\\nPCVR\\nLike its predecessor, the Q3 will work with your PC Oculus and Steam VR games, providing you have a powerful PC. With the new resolution, wider FOV and lenses, PCVR games look better than ever!\\n\\nOverall - I absolutely love the Quest 3, even my spouse who had no interest in VR was amazed by the mixed reality and now wants one as well.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"Disclosure: I paid for this item with my own money\\n\\nSixteen months ago, I bought a Q2 [for PCVR\\u00b9, thus far the native apps aren\\u2019t of interest] and didn\\u2019t use it as much as I\\u2019d expected.\\u00b2 With this in mind, frankly, I had some serious reservations about getting a Q3, but now that I have one in hand and can compare them side-by-side, I\\u2019ve ZERO regrets.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Resolution: improved, but not enough to be the sole reason to upgrade.\\nI can still, just barely, see the space between pixels. The rendering of small text elements is more readable as they are better formed and there is less shimmer.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Lenses: WOW!\\nThe difference in clarity between the Q2\\u2019s Fresnel lenses and the Q3\\u2019s pancake optics is night and day. Not only is the clarity improved, but the \\u201csweet-spot\\u201d is huge in comparison. Definitely a reason to upgrade.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3a Field of View: noticeably improved both horizontally and vertically.\\nWhile still constrained, it feels less like I\\u2019m viewing the world through a scuba mask.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3f Contrast: comparable\\nBlack is still dark grey. I really wish they had used micro-LED (as they did on the QPro) or OLED displays.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b Pass through cameras: a significant QoL improvement\\nAs a glasses wearer (I bought a set of third party prescription lens inserts), it's really nice not to have to take off the headset to do a lot of things which, on the Q2 required removing the headset, putting on my glasses, doing the thing, taking off my glasses, putting the headset back on, and adjusting it for comfort. I should acknowledge that a privacy/security minded individual might well find the improved pass through cameras disturbing. You may find yourself, as I did, doing things like unlocking your phone or entering your computer's password with the headset on. \\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\ud83d\\ude2c\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude3b IPD settings: significantly improved\\nThe Q3 offers fine grained control, while the Q2 coarse-grained control gives you a choice of just 3 settings.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude10 Controllers: neutral\\nI liked the rings on the Q2\\u2019s because they served as built-in stands; there are no rings on the Q3\\u2019s. Otherwise, they feel good in the hand and work just fine.\\n\\nThings I\\u2019ve not specifically tested, but are noted in the reviews I\\u2019ve read while doing my pre-purchase research:\\n\\u2022 battery life: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 sound quality: reportedly worse than on the Q2\\n\\u2022 eye-relief mechanism: the Q3 has a built-in mechanism to adjust the lens distance, while the Q2 required the installation of spacers\\n\\u2022 native gaming experience: the Q3 reportedly has 2.6X GPU power and 2.1X CPU power as the Q2\\n\\nOverall: while I\\u2019m sad there weren\\u2019t any BF/CM deals for the base model Q3, at $500+tax, it\\u2019s a still terrific bargain. It\\u2019s a shame about the contrast though \\ud83d\\ude39\\n\\nBTW: setup requires pairing with the Oculus app on your phone. Neither the app nor the screen in the headset tells you that the phone must be connected to the same wifi network as the Q3 AND bluetooth must be enabled. I didn\\u2019t have wifi enabled and couldn\\u2019t figure out why it wouldn\\u2019t pair until a trip to the interwebs revealed the fix.\\n_____\\n\\u00b9 \\u2014 For PCVR I\\u2019m using Virtual Desktop. Some folks swear by Meta\\u2019s own Quest Link (some preferring the WiFi version, others, the wired version using USB), but it seems they are predominately owners of Green Team graphics cards. I\\u2019ve got a Red Team 6800XT and Virtual Desktop gives me the best results by far. To minimize latency, the headset is connected directly to the PC, which is hosting a dedicated hotspot. I\\u2019ve not tried yet Quest Link with the Q3, but Virtual Desktop handles it just fine. [A curious aside: on my system, Virtual Desktop\\u2019s \\u201cHVEC 10-bit\\u201d encoder, which graphically is better than the plain \\u201cHVEC\\u201d encoder, also has a lower latency!]\\n\\n\\u00b2 \\u2014 Considering the price I paid vis-\\u00e0-vis. what it can do, I still regard the Q2 as a true bargain. In a sense, even its limitations were a positive, because it made me aware of what I wanted out of my next headset.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"Having grown up on the NES and SNES, I was happy to see an entirely new 2D entry in the mainline mario series. After the phenomenal Super Mario Odyssey easily became my family's favorite video game during the pandemic, we were somewhat disappointed with the remakes that have been released since. It was an easy choice to pre-order Super Mario Wonder, but I was doubtful the experience could compare to Odyssey, despite more emphasis on co-op play.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nFrom the start screen, the essence of Mario games is captured perfectly in Super Mario Wonder. Levels oscillate between familiar terrains and novel landscapes. Most mario games offer something new that at first seems like it will disrupt the always-solid platforming experience and genius level design hallmark to 2D mario adventures. Wonder includes several new power-ups, an overwhelming number of one-at-a-time badges provide a small change in-stage, and the wonder flower induces brief level-warping or mario-warping mini-challenges. None of these are affect the game on the level of Oydssey's Cappy or Mario Sunshine's FLUDD. However, they are all interesting and worthy additions. They also allow for a solo base difficulty that is decidedly more challenging (as you get further into the game) than many other 2D Mario games. Yet, the game (as you would expect) is adaptive to a wide range of player skill because of the co-op, invincible characters (that don't need to be unlocked), new power-ups, and badges. Still, I do miss the simplicity of the platforming challenges hallmark to Mario games, which aren't quite as much on display here as compared to collecting star coins in New Super Mario Bros.\\n\\nGraphics:\\nGraphically, the game delivers as much as the hardware allows. Detailed environments and distinct aesthetics for each world are evident. It can be a bit busy, but always fun. The level of polish is as good as any Mario game, which already sets the bar high. Character animations, character model design, enemy design, and effects, all add greatly to the experience.\\n\\nControls:\\nThe controls, for the most part, are what you'd expect from a Mario title: reliable. Yet, during some platforming, my kids experienced issues they blamed on lagging response. It could have been that they were sitting too far from the Switch or that they are kids. I didn't notice any issues with input lag or imprecision. I also love that Nintendo just 2 core (run and jump) buttons are needed most of the time, supplementing with the top-right bumper button (or, alternatively, shaking the control) on occasion.\\n\\nCo-op:\\nThe co-op mode is where \\\"Super Mario Wonder\\\" truly attempts to bridge the generational gap. Collaborating with my children, combining our abilities to face challenges, is a great way to spend time together. The characters that don't receive damage from enemies make it easy for novices to contribute to the progress and keep up with more advanced players.\\n\\nOverall Assessment:\\nSuper Mario Wonder delivers on combining many of the most beloved and nostalgiac components of former 2D Mario adventures while avoiding the trap of feeling like an updated version of a previous game. My kids enjoyed the new features more than I did, with my 8-year old laughing hysterically every time I hop along as a crouched elephant Mario. I'll update as we continue our adventure...\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Introduction:\\nAs a self-proclaimed cool dad with a lifelong love for video games, I was excited to dive into the Mario Wonder Switch Game.

The cooperative multiplayer mode allows my kids and me to team up and enjoy the game together. It's a fantastic way to bond with them while solving puzzles, battling foes, and working as a team. The competitive mode is also a blast for some healthy family rivalry.\\n\\nNostalgia Factor:\\nBeing a lifelong Mario fan, I appreciate the nods to the franchise's history. Mario Wonder Switch includes various references and throwbacks to earlier titles, making it a nostalgia trip for me. It's a pleasure to share these moments with my kids and tell them about the good old days of gaming.\\n\\nReplay Value:\\nThe game's extensive content and collectibles add significant replay value.

            "        \"4\": \"Mario has always been present in my life. My first serious interactions that my memory recalls is from Super Smash Bros Melee, he was the headliner, the face of Nintendo, but I still would rather play as Link. I dabbled here and there with the 2D games often getting too frustrated with them and not feeling enough of a hook to continue with the harder levels, let alone beat the whole game.\\n\\nMy first Mario game that I really played through and throughly enjoyed was Mario Odyssey. A great 3D plat-former. I wouldn\\u2019t put it up there with my all time favorites but I had a great time with it.\\n\\nWhen Nintendo revealed Super Mario Bros Wonder back a few months ago, I shrugged it off and made no plans to play it (I was salty about the lack of a Wind Waker port announcement being made on Switch and still am). But I had been hearing some buzz about it and thought I\\u2019d pick it up as a birthday gift to myself sense I hadn\\u2019t been playing any games as of late.\\n\\nAll that to say, this game is simply wonderful. \\u201cWonder\\u201d was the perfect title for this game. It had such a sense of joy, and glee about its creativity and is a celebration of what Mario is. You really get a sense of how much everyone who worked on this game really love what they do. They made something truly special.\\n\\nThe gameplay is tight, responsive, challenging, and a blast to play. The level design is out of this world creative, second to none, can\\u2019t think of a game that has done it better, the graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not the best at 2D platformers so I struggled with a few of the levels, and I can\\u2019t really compare the difficulty level with this and other Mario\\u2019s, but I\\u2019m going to have to go back and play some other 2D titles now.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. It\\u2019s a joy to play and really brings back what games are supposed to be about: fun gameplay and a fun experience with none of the strings attached like the rest of the gaming landscape right now.\\n\\n10/10\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"OK so I love this game, it brings a lot of new art and fun to the table. It does seem, at least to me, to be very easy, but at the same time it's possible I've just gotten way too good at Mario games. But this may mean no matter what skill level you have or don't, you will have a lot of fun and for some of you, you may have a bit of a challenge. I've yet to try multiplayer as I have no friends (JK) but I understand it's like the NSMB multiplayer except you can't throw your friends or bump into them, so I dunno. In Single player, you can play whatever character you want, so if you want to go through the whole game as a pretty Princess who turns into a Princess Elephant, you can do that. They have some easy mode players as well that don't die when hit by enemies, and if you use them, that can be our little secret. I also want to point out that this game is roughly the same size as my all time favorite, Mario 3, even though somehow it feels like I'm zipping through this game really fast compared to that one. I did the comparison so you didn't have to. There are a good number of regular levels + some bonus levels, like the one where you race a caterpillar for some reason. There's also some funky stuff that you may already know about, so I'll let you just discover all that on your own.\",\n",

The first thought I had was why are they not making a Super Mario Odyssey II!? Which I\\u2019ve still not given up hope for. When I discovered it was going to be a 2D at this point the trailer had not been released so we didn\\u2019t know it was the Wonder version & just how phenomenal it was going to be. I was assuming it would be something similar to the Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe which I lost interest in. As soon as the trailer for Wonder was released I said to my husband I\\u2019m buying it. Pre ordering it right now. Just prior to seeing the trailer I had told him I wouldn\\u2019t be buying the new 2D game because I was that upset it wasn\\u2019t Odyssey II or any 3D Mario game. I\\u2019m so glad I decided to purchase this game. First I must mention that it was delivered to our door the SAME DAY the game was released. My husband & I played it immediately & were instantly obsessed!!!!!! This is the most beautiful Mario game to date. I love it equally as much as I do Super Mario Odyssey which is saying a lot. I wish it was just as long as Odyssey though. So I guess that would be my only complaint. While it\\u2019s definitely not a short game - I do wish it was longer because I love it that much. I just never want it to end. I\\u2019d say many of us are still hoping for an Odyssey II one of these days but this will definitely help in passing the time while the world waits for it!!!

So when Nintendo came out with this game this year, I jumped for joy. It has so many cool features, including having different gaming experiences with each character you play as, which results in essentially an infinite number of different playing experiences. So cool.

It gives personalities to icons like Peach and Bowser.\\n\\nThis is the game that introduced various features of these characters that we would go on to see in later games, especially stuff like Peach being equipped with umbrellas and frying pans, or treating fireballs as sort of a default power that Mario has up his sleeve, even without picking up a Fire Flower (as we see in Super Smash Bros).\\n\\nThis game also introduces a number of unique new characters who are absolutely fantastic, and deserve to be in dozens of more games.\\nGeno, Mallow, Croco, Booster, Johnny, etc.\\n\\nIn a year when The Legend Of Zelda:Tears Of The Kingdom came out, Super Mario RPG's remake ended up being my Game Of The Year.\\nAs great as TOTK is, and as much crazy big ambitious stuff and complexity as it rings to the table, it falls faaaaar short of achieving its true potential, and there are huge swaths of that game that feel lacking and incomplete.\\nSuper Mario RPG does not have that problem for even a second.\\nEverything in Super Mario RPG feels like it is living VERY close to the maximum potential of the Mario franchise.\\nEvery second is fun. Everything is interesting. The whole world is full of stuff to find and do, and people to talk to, and silly jokes and gags, and interesting little story bits.\\nHow many dungeons and boss fights are there in Zelda TOTK? Maybe 10 if you count one instance of each species of big regular monster (Ganon, Temple bosses, Hinox, Gleeok, Talus, Flux Construct, etc?)\\nI have literally no idea how many boss fights Super Mario RPG has.\\nThere are so so many.\\nSuper Mario RPG has like 4-5 boss battles JUST within the tutorial area. I can think of at least 30 bosses in Super Mario RPG, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch.\\n\\nIt's not a perfect game, but for a game that came out 30 years ago, and has only been minimally upgraded in this remake, it is SHOCKINGLY close.\\n\\nOf all the Mario games that exist, this one is One of the must-have games in the series, alongside: Super Mario World, Super Mario Bros 3, Super Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with all the DLC, Super Mario Bros Wonder,.....and the remake of Super Mario 64 that they absolutely desperately need to make.....\\n\\nThis is better than the original Mario Bros, the original Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros The Lost levels, Super Mario Bros 2, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2, all the Paper Mario games, all the Super Mario Land games, all the Mario Party games, almost all of the Mario Kart games, all the Mario sports games, etc etc etc.\\n\\nThis belongs in that core handful of Mario games that every gamer needs to play to understand how phenomenal Mario can truly be.\\n\\nIt's a tiny thumbnail-sized game cartridge full of happiness.\\n\\n\\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f\",\n",

It keeps faithful to the original game, while improving on it in many ways. Some fights feel easier, while others feel harder. Parts of the game I would have sworn were longer are now shorter. There are cutscenes that add more to basically all of the characters, the updated graphics keep all the charm of the game's style while looking great, and the ending cinematic made me smile like a little kid. One of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long time, brought by a brilliant remake of an already excellent game. I'd give it more than five stars if I could. Seven would seem an appropriate number.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"If you are expecting a typical side scroll 2D jump, jump, jump Mario game, you will be disappointed (watch the trailers).\\n\\nBasic Plot: Mario and his team must join together and save all the people in the mushroom kingdom from the evil Smithy, a monster who destroyed the star road so that people\\u2019s wishes will never come true (simplified version).\\n\\nGeneral review: The game stays true to the original SNES title with minor changes and quality of life improvements. The game looks fantastic and plays true to the original. The plot and story are much more complex compared to typical Mario saves Peach games. The characters are extremely unique and bring a whole lot of personality to the Mario world and characters we love. It is not an open world game, but there are still quite a few areas to explore with secrets and treasures to find.\\n\\nGameplay: The fight sequences use a turn based style where the three people in your party take turns to attack before your enemy (s) will have their turn to counter attack (simple explanation of it). The turn based style can be repetitive and boring if you are not accustomed to this gameplay or looking for something more fast paced.\\n\\nGameplay: This is an RPG so you do gain experience points as you slay enemies and level up your party members. When you level, you will have 3 options to pick from: physical attack/defense, magical attack/defense, or health/hp. Whichever you pick, the stats within that category will increase. For an RPG, it is a very simple leveling system and easy to understand without getting overly complex.\\n\\nMy experience: Personally, I played/beat the original SNES countless times and was able to beat this remastered version to 100% within 12 hours\\u2026 but again, experience was on my side. I would say for someone new to this, it could take them 10 - 20 hours - a shorter and easier RPG with a captivating plot.\\n\\nFinal thoughts: It is an easy RPG for experienced players but you play for the story (or nostalgia), not the difficulty. If you are looking for a good, easy introduction to RPGs, this is a good game to start with for not being overly complicated. If you do not like turn based attacks, RPGs, or just looking for a typical fast paced challenging Mario game, this is not the game for you.\\n\\n5 stars for a 1-1 remaster of the original (with additional, new gameplay content) and what I expected the game would be.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"This was my first RPG I remember playing back in 1996. It launched my love of turn based role playing games. I think I beat this game a few dozen times on the Super Nintendo when I was 12. I have very fond memories of this game. So when I heard it was being released on the switch I was very excited.\\n\\nI broke one of my cardinal rules of game buying with this. I pre-ordered it. Nintendo rarely has launch issues with games but I still try to avoid pre-ordering games. But I couldn't help myself with this one.\\n\\nThe game is excellent. They upgraded the graphics which may have taken away some of the charm of the original but I think it looks great. They even kept in the 2d OG mario Easter Egg in Boosters Tower, and pixelated Culex boss. The game play was exactly as I remembered it and still a joy to play.\\n\\nNintendo made a few quality of life improvements to the game. First they created a Breezy mode which makes the game just a bit easier. It lifts the item cap, makes the timed attack window larger and more forgiving, and makes the enemies easier (I have my 6 year old playing on this setting).\\n\\nOther QOL improvements include adding an icon to help with timed attacks. A chest in Mario's house to carry extra items where in the original they would just be lost. The game now auto saves pretty frequently (usually as you enter a new area), so you don't have to search out a save location. They also added a upgrade to the signal ring that makes it easier to find hidden treasures, that can be acquired later in the game. They also added post game play, making the bosses more challenging and adding new weapons and gear.\\n\\nMost of the online reviews to this game forget it's an introductory RPG meant for children. They nitpick and complain about the lack of challenge. Super Mario RPG is a fantastic game that will take around 13 hours to beat, but it's a great 13 hours. If you played this game in the 90s get it. If you have a child and are looking to get them a forgiving turn based RPG to learn, get this game. If you are looking for 13 hours of fun without the grind of games like Final Fantasy, get this game. If you want a challenging grueling slog that will take hours off your life and leave you angry most of the time, get Dark Souls.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"The developers of this game knew exactly what it would take to please the fans of this game. Simply put, this game is the best remake that I have played in the past couple of years. It has so much love poured into it, every detail that I expected to be here from the original game is here- and additional content. I was incredibly scared that the hype for this game was going to end up causing it to be a bad game, but that is not the case.\\n\\nThis is a fantastic game that caters to both fans of the original game and those who are wanting to get into RPGs. I have seen several 1 star reviews, and to be completely honest those reviews seemed to have come from those who have never played an RPG before and expected simply another Mario game coming into this. I can't think of anything that this game doesn't improve upon from the original game. The RPG mechanics are engaging, even difficult at times with having the player time certain actions within battles to drastically change the gameplay. However, it does a fantastic job with the ! indicators telling the player when to properly time their button presses.\\n\\nThe story is of course a remake of the original title on the SNES, however I believe that its humor still stands today. I can't really say many games today make me laugh the way they intended or at least without a slight awkward feeling at a forced joke, but this game actually makes me smile more often than not. This game has some seriously funny moments, and the modernized visuals make scenes much more entertaining.\\n\\nThe only negative element I can even come up with for this game is the slight frame drops when the scene gets too intense with effects and too many models. Aside from that, the game runs at seemingly a solid 60 fps, with 30 fps for the cutscenes. Aside from the random moments of lag, the game is beautiful and runs fantastic.\\n\\nI without a doubt recommend this game.\",\n",

The gameplay is fun and the writing is still as charming as the original title that came out nearly three decades ago. It's definitely worth its price.\\n\\nThe post game has been expanded upon, too.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"The problem with remaking video games is the design philosophy around what a remake should even try to accomplish. Video games just don't age as well as products from most other mediums. True, I love video games and they are my favorite way to pass time, but game mechanics, graphics and interactivity can resonate with older audiences that hadn't encountered them before while newer ones will often at best find them quaint and others find them cumbersome. Should a remake essentially tart up the aesthetics and keep the core gameplay the same, winning over the original audience but potentially losing the new? Or should a remake shake things up, evolving what was rusty from the ground up, risking the loss of what made the game special to begin with?\\n\\nSuper Mario RPG is unabashedly in the first camp. It is very safe. It introduces some minor mechanics like the triple attacks that don't factor much in moment to moment gameplay at all, and adds some boss rematches and such. It sticks close to the original, remaking the graphics and music but not really shaking up the script, the general story, the turn based gameplay or the bad platforming (for a Mario game, even an RPG, that's honestly a serious flaw for a game with a lot of it).\\n\\nSpeaking as someone who has always had a fascination with Super Mario RPG, but never played through it entirely, this remake gave me my fill. I still prefer its successors; the first two Paper Marios are simply tighter, more engaging experiences. Regardless, this game is funny, quite charming, and has lots of cute metagame moments, like a boss that literally disables your attack options (novel for 1996). I do think it loses a bit in the jump to 3D; the original 2D, chunky graphics were beautiful and strange and compelling and gave rise to many memes because of it. The remake looks good but in a bland way, not blocky and puffy like the old sprites but losing a bit of their memorability. The music is of course fantastic. Yoko rarely misses.\\n\\nIt's a strangely unbalanced experience, in terms of pacing. Some stars are found much quicker than others, and a decent amount of the story feels like padding, albeit amusing padding. The final area(s) feel rushed and the finicky imprecise jumping controls I feel really falter here.\\n\\nIf it sounds like my review is a little harsher than kind, it's because I hadn't grown up with this game and I'm approaching it as an N64 kid playing it for the first time being almost in my thirties. People who played and loved the original will have plenty of fun seeing what was changed, reliving iconic moments and so on. In all honesty it's a good game, and still worth playing. All Mario RPGs, and even many RPGs in general now, borrow a lot from this game and that has to be acknowledged. It's influential for a reason; the people at Square clearly loved making this game, and that rubs off on the player. I just wish that reverence could factor into bolder gestures toward making the game fresher over 25 years later, and by not charging full price for what is nearly the same amount of game content from '96.\\n\\nRecommended if you like Mario, easy SNES RPGs, and big Yoshis, and especially if you like all three.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"This is nearly a 1 to 1 remake of the original Super Mario RPG game. The music remaster is beautiful and you can even opt for the original soundtrack in the settings. But the remaster of the music is so good you may not want to. All the little things you may remember (if you played the original) are still there. The hidden block you only have one or two opportunities to grab in the Mushroom Kingdom... Link and Samus snoozing at the inn.\\n\\nWhat they did is they recreated the entire game with updated HD graphics. But kept Mario's pudgy little design the same. The \\\"cutscenes\\\" have been replaced with full rendered cutscenes that pan down to in game engine graphics instead of just watching in game graphics move about to act out a scene.\\n\\nThe best change though is the post game content. Rematches with all the bosses (story element explains why) and they are much tougher the second time around. New \\\"ultimate\\\" weapons post game and even some new super bosses to use those shiny new weapons on.\\n\\nThey pretty much kept the original experience until you beat the game. After that, they gave you more to chew on as additions. A bestiary. A music player. In game stats. Super bosses, rematches, new gear.\\n\\nThis is how you do a remaster. A proper remaster.\\n\\nI truly hope they use all this effort to give this game a long overdue sequel. Because it is one of the best Mario games out there. Paper Mario and the Mario + Luigi games can't hold a candle to this.\"\n",

The character designs stay true to the iconic Zelda aesthetics while introducing new characters that quickly become favorites.\\n\\nGameplay is a delightful mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat. The controls are intuitive, making it easy to dive into the adventure, whether you're a veteran of the series or a newcomer. The puzzles are thoughtfully designed, challenging enough to be engaging without being frustrating. Combat is fluid and responsive, with a variety of weapons and abilities that allow for different strategies to tackle the challenges ahead.\\n\\nThe story is rich and well-paced, with a perfect balance of dramatic moments and lighthearted humor that the series is known for. The music and sound design are impeccable, enhancing the emotional impact of the narrative and the thrill of exploration.\",\n",

Its mechanics offer immense freedom in both puzzles and combat, enriching the exploration aspect.\\n\\nRefreshing Changes\\n-While it shares the same world as Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom introduces enough modifications and new content to keep things feeling fresh. You'll often find yourself wondering about the transformed towns and the whereabouts of familiar characters.\\n\\nStunning Visuals\\n-The cel-shading style and improved lighting make the game's visuals simply breathtaking. You'll frequently catch yourself marveling at the beauty, like watching the sunset from a sky island.\\n\\nEngaging Story\\n-Though not groundbreaking, the story adds depth to the game. They've done an excellent job with Zelda's character, and it's enjoyable to connect the dots between the new events in Tears of the Kingdom and what transpired between it and Breath of the Wild.\\n\\nCONS:\\nPerformance Issues\\n-One downside is occasional lag, even on an OLED. If you have an older Switch, you may experience even worse frame drops, which can be quite frustrating.\\n\\nDisconnect from BOTW\\n-Tears of the Kingdom seems to distance itself from being a sequel to accommodate players who haven't experienced Breath of the Wild. While avoiding spoilers, the game often assumes you know nothing about the previous game, and characters act as if they've never met you before. It's not a deal-breaker but feels like an odd design choice.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Negatives first:\\nThere are a decent amount of reused themes and mechanics that I do wish they could have changed up a bit. There is definitely some repetitiveness there.\\nThe graphics (and I am not a graphics-first person...ever) are a problem here and there...I think it's a theming choice made by nintendo more than anything, but in the sky islands they add this cloudiness effect to everything (even in sky island caves) that can make it difficult to discern things. It's hard to explain, but I actually had to change my display settings to crank up the contrast (which is screwing up my settings on my other games and consoles). My kids even mentioned how hard it is to see things at times.\\n\\nPositives\\nPeople are complaining about similarity to BotW....and I don't get it. As big as the BotW world was, it feels small compared to this game. I'm about 10 hours in, I haven't done anything yet that felt like a retread (other than what I mentioned above). It has the same \\\"see something out of the corner of your eye, go investigate, and lose two hours\\\" trait that I loved about BotW.\\nThis game is much more story driven (not through flashbacks) thus far, which is great.\\n\\nSo-so\\nThe new weapons mechanics are cool...but I do miss more traditional weapons at times. So far (and this may change as I get deeper) everything I've found is stupid under powered, you always have to craft to have anything useful. The crafting/building is fun and new, but how you HAVE TO do so much of it that it can be game-breaking here and there.\\n\\nI love the game, I can't wait until I have some real time to sink a few uninterrupted days into it. It is not perfect, but I still gave it a perfect score because the fun-factor and awe of BotW are absolutely in-tact and the scale is unbelievable. The positives erase the negatives in my mind.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Stepping into a new chapter in the iconic Legend of Zelda series, \\\"Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\\\" is a masterclass in video game design. Drawing upon the rich history of this beloved franchise, this game artfully interweaves nostalgic elements with a fresh, innovative perspective, making it a must-play for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. I truly though it would just be a chewed-up and spit-out breath of the wild, its not, its better!\\n\\nWhat immediately captivates the player is the deeply immersive world, teeming with intricate details and the unparalleled charm we've come to expect from the Zelda franchise. Every kingdom, every landscape feels alive and filled with potential adventure, inviting players to lose themselves in the exploration.\\n\\nThe game mechanics remain faithful to the Zelda essence, while introducing new, cleverly designed features that elevate the overall gaming experience. It has the same shrine system as botw but new ways to work through puzzles and rewards you for being inventive.\\n\\nThe narrative of \\\"Tears of the Kingdom\\\" is enchanting and engaging, drawing you into its depths with each progressing plot point. The character development, including the evolving relationship between Link and Zelda, is genuinely touching and contributes greatly to the emotional resonance of the story.\\n\\nHowever, it's worth mentioning that \\\"Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\\\" is a game that demands time and patience. The expansive world and multiple sub-quests can be overwhelming to some, but for those willing to invest the effort, the rewards are plentiful.\\n\\nThe only slight drawback is the game's item-breaking mechanic. weapons you love will break and you will miss them. That being said just keep with it and soon you will find something even better.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"This is Link at his finest. He has really grown into the super hero role he was meant to have.\\n\\nThe story is a bit lackluster, as usual. There are lots of quests and so much content that you can spend hundreds of hours playing this, but the stories are always a little cringy and lame. It is meant to be kid-safe, after all.\\n\\nThe game mechanics are where this game shines. Zonai devices allow you to build practically any kind of vehicle you want. Like Minecraft, except that things are meant to move, with circles and everything. The physics is extremely robust. Link can engineer up doomsday devices and ride them into enemy camps.\\n\\nThe game design is beautiful, just like its predecessor, Breath of the Wild. It's the same Hyrule surface map, but there are over a hundred new cave systems, a sky island map, and a Depths map, which is sort of an Upside Down under Hyrule. I like that the devs kept the best parts of BotW and merely expanded it into a whole new kind of game.\\n\\nCombat in BotW/TotK is great, and lots of fun. Back when I was playing Zelda for NES and SNES, I never would have imagined that the game franchise would get to this level of amazing.\\n\\nThe only complaint I have is the story. There is basically no consistency between Zelda games, each one has to be taken as its own independent narrative. I know there are people who try to mesh it all together -- even Nintendo came out with a timeline once -- but I don't buy it. If their next game could be both consistent within itself, and utilize the best aspects of all past Zelda stories, Nintendo could set up future games after that for sequential story telling, and that would be fantastic. It's the only thing the game is missing.\\n\\nThis is basically a single player RPG meets Open World Sandbox. The best kind of RPG. You can follow quest lines, and there are many -- you can collect things, there are tons of things to collect -- or you can just build devices and defeat enemies for fun. You don't even have to pursue the main story line and you can still love this game. Highly recommend!!\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Where to begin with this game? Did you enjoy Breath of the Wild? Were you frustrated by certain aspects? If the answer was yes to both, you\\u2019ll love this game.\\n\\nI have been a Zelda fan all the way back to playing Zelda 2 when I was 4. And when Breath of the Wild came out, I was blown away, but also frustrated by aspects of it. Yes the game did away with most of the standard Zelda formula, but enough still remained for me to enjoy it as a Zelda game. What blew me away though was the size of the game, the focus on exploration and many other things. However, many things frustrated me like how long it took to get around, warping to shrines was easy, but losing your horse was always a serious pain.\\n\\nNow we arrive at the new game Tears of the Kingdom, clearly a sequel to BOTW that uses the same map, but manages to keep it fresh by introducing sky islands and the depths. And first off, if you felt BOTW had a massive map, this will blow you away. There is so much more to explore, but yet the game moves SO much faster by changing the towers from things you have to slowly climb to activate to just making them usually have a small puzzle to get them activated. Once you have these towers up, the game gets MUCH easier to navigate as each launches you miles into the sky where you can glide down toward the next closest one, or perhaps a shrine or other notable area. This eliminated the problem I had with horses and in fact, I barely used mine over the course of the entire game.\\n\\nThe new powers you gain at the start also open this up to a realm of creativity previously offered by other games like Minecraft, but in a Zelda game, it feels fresh. I can only say this game will feel like a dream to any engineers or someone with an interest in building. You can truly get lost in crafting weapons or vehicles, but even if only done when necessary it\\u2019s a lot of fun. I who think the shrine puzzles have gotten much harder (at least for someone like me), but they were still fun and brilliant to experience.\\n\\nFinally there\\u2019s the story. I was surprised after feeling BOTW had a very forgettable story that this had a very rich and emotional story as you learn about how Ganondorf came to power and was originally defeated, as well and the truth of what happened to Zelda after the start of the game. I absolutely love it and all the characters. Honestly, the only two Zelda games to top this for me are Wind Waker and Link\\u2019s Awakening.\\n\\nSo yes, to sum up, this is easily one of the best Zelda games of all time and improves on BOTW so much, I can\\u2019t even see myself revisiting that game now.\",\n",

Link has several new abilities (will list later) to play around with\\n\\nWorld is more expansive: There\\u2019s the Great Plateau (old Breath of the Wild map) with slightly altered environments due to gloom infection, the sky city, and the depths (huge underground cave network below hyrule). Smoke and highlighted light pillars shows points of interest in the overworld without having to look at the map\\n\\nWeapon durability is back. I know some people don\\u2019t like breakable items/weapons, but it teaches kids to be more adaptable rather than have constant/sustainable gains all the time. Also helps them be more creative in the fusing items together. Items are less scarce this time around giving you more opportunities to experiment with new combinations\\n\\nStill have freedom to be creative and do what you want.

Gives you the \\u2018I don\\u2019t think we are supposed to do that, but it worked!\\u2019 moments\\n\\nTemples return. Each one have a companion character which grants you special abilities for that temple/dungeon. Bosses at end of temples are really powerful and not just simple advanced moving puzzles\\n\\n-Menu/UI is more streamline.\\n\\nInventory tabs can be changed via L1 R1 trigger instead of thumbstick. No need to go through multiple pages to get to the next tab. Instead you scroll down if you have a lot of items\\n\\nSettings is at the end of inventory tab instead of a separate page\\n\\nAble to view recipes on sub menu for each item\\n\\n-Story/Plot:\\n\\nLink and Zelda is exploring a unknown area under hyrule castle. They accidentally awaken an mummy and he uses gloom ability to attack them. Link arm and master sword gets infected during initial battle, and the mummy released gloom infecting hyrule. There\\u2019s a huge quake and Link both get separated during the scuffle. You wake up and go on a quest to find Zelda, re-forge the master sword and save hyrule.\\n\\nStory is the most expansive than any other Zelda title focusing a lot of character development\\n\\nLike Breath of the Wild; there\\u2019s limited voice acting and not fully voiced. But that doesn\\u2019t detract from the experience\\n\\n--- Abilities\\n\\n1. Ultra Hand\\n\\nUse this to lift large heavy object and fuse them together. Can use it to solve puzzles lifting heavy objects to build bridges, ramps, ladders, etc) but also use as a vehicle creator for traversal. It\\u2019s very similar to Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts vehicle creator. Vehicles you create use fuel/battery to operate, collecting/using zonai charges refuels your vehicle giving you the ability to travel longer distances especially when creating gliders. You can also upgrade maximum battery as you progress through he game. Note that our creation despawns if you\\u2019re too far away from it, so best not abandon it\\n\\n2. Merge items\\n\\nFuse any two items together in inventory. Mainly use to create weapons with different properties (higher attack, range, elemental damage etc) and increase durability. Seeing weapon durability is back gives players ways to experiment and be resourceful with what they have in their inventory\\n\\nDuring combat you\\u2019re able to able to throw individual items\\n\\n3. Asend\\nAble to teleport to above flat platform when directly under it. Some areas are restricted if it\\u2019s too high. The cursor on your screen when using ability turns green to indicate if it\\u2019s possible to ascend or not\\n\\n4. Recall\\n\\nRewind time for a brief second. Great for puzzle solving like climbing up a rock that fell off the cliff and rewind time to ride it up\\n\\n5. Auto build\\n\\nAble to re-create previous creations you made with ultra-hand. Just have all items in one spot and use ability to re-create it instead of starting from scratch\\n\\n6. Amiibo\\n\\nSimilar to last game, you can in amiibo daily and items will fall in front of you. Amiibo give armor skins, fabrics, and other common items. No exclusive content from Amiibos this time. Able to obtain them via quests. Scanning amiibos just give you them early and more items daily. Disappointed the wolf link amiibo doesn\\u2019t give you wolf companion like the last game\\n\\n7. Camera\\n\\nBasically an ability to take pictures to fill out the hyrule compendium\\n\\nOverall extremely fun game giving you freedom to explore and be creative. Best Legend of Zelda game to date.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"The short version is that this game improves and expands upon Breath of the Wild in every possible way, with the only real con being that this game pushes the Switch to its absolute limit, and you will encounter a very occasional framerate chug. Also they took away my hearty durians!\\n\\nVast amounts of Content:\\n\\nSome were concerned when it was announced this game would utilize the same map from BOTW (its predecessor), so much to the point where it became common to see this game referred to as BOTW DLC prior to its prelease. I can assure you this is not the case. The is the game equivalent of a BMW 1M. Much how like that car was cobbled together from the BMW parts bin, but somehow became one of the best cars they ever made, this game is made with many existing assets and yet surpasses all my expectations. Not only are there sky islands, but their are caves, and an entire other layer of the world to explore (which I won't spoil if you've somehow managed to avoid spoilers for this game). There's also more to the story this time, and I swear they've at least doubled the amount of side content.\\n\\nMore enjoyable combat:\\n\\nWhile this game uses the same general combat as BOTW, what's improved is the way you use weapons. They still break if that bothered you before, but I feel far less restricted thanks to the Fuse mechanic, which allows you to combine things with your weapons and shields. The consequence of this is that you feel far less unwilling to use your higher powered weapons. In BOTW I would hoard them, and I still do a little, but I also am at least willing to use them more frequently than before thanks to the fact that I can fuse a weak little stick into something more potent at almost any time. Additionally arrows are far easier to come by, as of writing this I've been on my playthrough for maybe 40-50 hours and have accumulated 200+ arrows without really trying to conserve.\\n\\nNo hearty durians?\\n\\nOk, since I brought it up, I'll make this it's own section. At first I hated this, the magical fruit that restored so much health it was almost gamebreaking in BOTW. However, in hindsight I think it was a good call, as I'm using more of the expanded materials/recipes now and it definitely adds to the game.\\n\\nOther details and conclusion:\\n\\nI hesitate to go into further details on this as it may spoil the experience of discovery, but I can say that the staples of BOTW are still here. Shrines, resource gathering, great fairies, upgrading your armor, all still play a huge role. The runes from the first game are gone, but are replaced with quirkier and largely more useful abilities, although I do miss the bombs. But even the function of the old remote bomb can be replicated in no less than three ways, depending on the situation. I have not beaten the game, but I have spent about 40-50 hours in this world by my estimate and completed three of the four major temples, and revealed the entire main map. Yet, despite that I feel like I'm still just scratching the surface. There have still been a few new enemy types that I still have no idea how to take down, or I need to collect more hearts/better armor. There is so much to see and do in this game, and so far it's all been very entertaining. I've been playing Zelda since Link's Awakening on Gameboy Color, and although this game like BOTW diverts somewhat from the classic formula, it is definitely in the lead for my favorite Zelda game of all time, and possibly my favorite open world game of all time. Truly fantastic.\",\n",

Despite some criticism surrounding its purportedly 'woke' themes, I opted to separate my political viewpoints from my gaming experience. In doing so, not only was I able to appreciate the game, but it genuinely exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nThe narrative construction corresponds to some of the most seamless and fascinating Spider-Man adaptations I've encountered across various mediums, be it television series, films, graphic novels, or even other video games. The compelling story intertwines effortlessly with the gameplay, making it a truly gripping depiction of the Spider-Man universe.\\n\\nThe gameplay, brimming with action sequences, engaging combat mechanics, and authentic Spider-Man mobility, is yet another impressive aspect of the game. It not only offers a fun, immersive playthrough but also promises high replay value with enough content and varying difficulty levels to keep you coming back for more.\\n\\nWhile there are minor glitches here and there, they do not detract significantly from the overall gameplay. And rest assured, in their constant efforts to improve user experience, Sony will likely be implementing patches in the future to rectify these glitches.\\n\\nIn terms of graphics, the game offers rich, crisp, and detailed visuals that take full advantage of the PS5's powerful hardware. The painstakingly crafted and vividly realized world of New York City, from its towering skyscrapers to its bustling streets below, is eye-catchingly beautiful.\\n\\nThe voice acting and score further enrich the game's cinematic quality. From the spectacularly realized characters to the dramatic orchestral music, every element adds to the atmosphere of the game.\\n\\nAll in all, Spider-Man 2 is a phenomenal addition to the PS5 lineup, encompassing a potent blend of gripping story, engaging gameplay, admirable graphics, and excellent audio design. It's a well-rounded gaming experience worth exploring, regardless of your politicial stance.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"Great story, great animations, great graphics. I mean this game is a huge step up from Spider-Man and Miles Morales in terms of graphics. This is like when you played beat em ups on NES then switched to SNES and the character sprites were bigger, beefier and looked so much better. That is the best way I can describe this. The addition of new traversal techniques are welcome and really add fun to moving around NYC.\\n\\nSpeaking of NYC, the map has been added to making it even more huge, they added Queens and Brooklyn and a couple other areas. I'm not from NYC, so I'm not that familiar with them. Fast travel is really cool, I mean, I'm not a fast travel person, but I had to try it out once and it's silky smooth, and there is no loading!\\n\\nThe story is great! Really tugs on the heart strings and Peter and Miles are great playing off each other. I don't want to spoil anything about the story because I went in blind and I was completely floored by the story and where it went. Just know it's fantastic!\\n\\nOverall, this is the best PS5 game this year and you should already own it. It took me about 28 hours to get the plat on Spectacular difficulty, and you only have to play it once to get the plat (but I'm sure you'll be playing it over and over). The only downside is that there isn't any NG+ stuff, like not even a NG+ mode. There isn't any reason to play this in NG+ like there was with Spider-Man and Miles Morales. Although I heard they are adding a NG+ mode by the end of the year, but I don't know why if there isn't any incentive to replay the game.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"I am still exploring all the game has to offer me. But this is an improvement on the first game on many levels.\\n\\nThis time around we get to play and switch between 2 heroes: Miles Morales and Peter Parker.\\nEach of them has unique abilities. Miles has abilities that revolve around his venom abilities, and Peter relies on his gadgets which can change gameplay and keep things fresh.\\n\\nYou also have the return of side activities and pop-up crime that help you gain exp and resources to upgrade your gear and suits.\\n\\nOne new thing for traversal is gliding, you gain access to this right in the beginning which makes exploring the city so much more fun.\\n\\nStory wise it is a classic spiderman tale. I haven't played through it all but I can see a very promising setup that is bound to be a whole rollercoaster.\\n\\nDo you need to play the previous games?\\nI recommend that you at least play the first insomniac spiderman game. The game offers a recap but a lot of call backs and nuance will be lost if you hop right into this game. On the other hand, you can completely skip the Miles Morales game and play this one. The Miles Morales game is only about 8 hrs of story which this game gives you a good recap of. Plus maybe skipping it will offer some more \\\"freshness\\\" to playing Miles in this game.\\n\\nCons:\\nThis game at its core retained a lot of what made the first game great. But it can feel repetitive. Combat as usual is not so much challenging but a mashing of buttons against enemies that soak up damage to different degrees depending on how \\\"tough\\\" they are. When the game tries to challenge you, it does so by throwing enemies that block you or try to overwhelm you with numbers which after a few fights can get cumbersome. The fights are definitely more enjoyable as Miles. At least for me.\\n\\nThere is some grind to this game, but only if you want to unlock everything and get every activity done. And I recommend at least unlocking skills because otherwise, combat will get even more stale.\\n\\nPros:\\nThe graphics are beautiful\\nThe swinging and traversal of the city is fun and so spot on.\\nStory is intriguing and the character switching is fun and freshens up the gameplay\\n\\nNow, is the game worth $69.99? Sadly, not to me.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, it is a fun game and if you liked the previous games and you enjoy Spiderman/Marvel you will like this game. You have a lot of gameplay and a lot of content to find and explore but when I looked it up the campaign averages 18-20 hrs without the side activities. When you include the side stuff you are looking at 30 hrs of gameplay. Unless you pursue a completionist gameplay then you are looking at 40 hrs (estimated)\\n\\nBut the content is not enough to warrant the not-so-new price increase of video games. If you are really excited about the game, you can buy it at full price. But honestly, I would wait for a sale if you can. Holidays are right around the corner afterall.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"This is easily the best Spiderman game ever made. The story is the best Insomniac has ever written, and the characters each have an arch that develop them over the course of the story. Every character is developed and by the end of the game they are different.\\n\\nThe traversal is 2-3x faster than the first Spiderman on PS4 and Miles Morales, momentum plays a much larger role in web swinging causing you to traverse much farther and faster when it\\u2019s built up.\\n\\nThe new powers for Peter bring him up to the level of Miles with powers, and the Spider legs are also a nice addition adding new special moves that can clear out enemies in droves. The new web line lets you take out multiple enemies at once in stealth and is a perfect addition to the game. There are a substantial amount of enemies thrown at you in each fight and this makes the combat even more challenging. Enemies have new attacks that can knock you out of the air, forcing you to adapt.\\n\\nThe boss battles are revamped and boss battles require much more attention. Bosses also have health bars now which makes them feel more traditional. The new parry mechanic forces you to block attacks that you cannot dodge, adding a layer of depth to them that will challenge you more. Some attacks can only be dodged, while others can only be parried. The boss fights are also much grander in scale while also more of them are thrown at you than in the previous 2 titles.\\n\\nThe side mission in SM2 are also much better than the previous 2 games (Howard the pigeon collector mission stands out at one of the best in the game and it is a side mission). Certain crime activities feel stale, such as stopping cars and fighting arsonists, but only a limited amount of these need to be done to 100% the game. More variety in this area would be nice, but this is not that important in the grand scheme of what the game offers.\\n\\nOverall, this game is the first true \\u201cnext generation\\u201d game all around with graphics, performance, fast travel, and super fast traversal. It is a showcase for what the PS5 Was designed for, and nothing on the market quite touches the stellar 60fps with ray tracing in an open world that loads as fast as this. This is a generation defining game that will be revered for years to come.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"I recently dove into the web-filled world of Insomniac\\u2019s Spider-Man 2 for the PS5, and let me tell you, it\\u2019s a spectacular experience that swings above and beyond its predecessor!\\n\\nFrom the moment you put on the Spidey suit, the upgraded graphics on the PS5 shine, delivering stunning visuals that capture the essence of New York City like never before. The cityscape is alive with vibrant details, and the fluidity of both Spider-Man\\u2019s movements adds a layer of realism that\\u2019s truly breathtaking.\\n\\nOne of the standout features is the enhanced combat system. Insomniac has managed to blend the smooth acrobatics of Spider-Man with a more intuitive combat interface. Combining punches, kicks, and web-based attacks feels incredibly natural, providing a satisfying combat experience that keeps you engaged throughout. It\\u2019s the closest I will ever feel to being Spider-Man!\\n\\nThe storyline is another highlight. Insomniac weaves a compelling narrative that delves deeper into Spider-Man\\u2019s world, introducing new characters and unexpected twists(no spoilers). The emotional depth of the characters adds a layer of authenticity that elevates the overall gaming experience.\\n\\nWeb-swinging has always been a defining aspect of Spider-Man games, and Insomniac nails it once again. The seamless transition between swinging, wall-running, gliding, and acrobatics makes traversing the city a joy.\\n\\nI also appreciate the attention to detail in the side missions and activities. They\\u2019re not just filler content; each one contributes to the overall narrative and rewards players with valuable upgrades and insights into Spider-Man\\u2019s world.\\n\\nIn summary, Insomniac\\u2019s Spider-Man 2 for the PS5 is a must-play for any fan of the web-slinger. It successfully builds upon the foundation of the first game, delivering a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and thoroughly enjoyable experience. Whether you\\u2019re swinging through the skyscrapers or facing off against iconic villains, this game truly captures the essence of being Spider-Man. Highly recommended for both fans and newcomers alike!\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"A great Spiderman game with outstanding visuals and some appreciated gameplay mechanics. The story is well written and enjoyable. Many gripes hold me back from giving this a solid 5 stars. We've seen the same moves and abilities with some fresh tweaks but over time the combat is going to feel a bit boring since it is recycled from previous games. What makes me dislike the game is the boss encounters, it's too overwhelming having to take more than 5-10 minutes to go on 3 rounds fighting the bosses. I played this in spectacular difficulty so you\\u2019re going to be sitting there for a while just to proceed through the main story. Another thing I dislike is the glitches, after installing the game. $70 is a hefty price tag when some scenes aren't rendered properly or the game just crashes because of the bugs. I've had multiple issues with the framerate frequently dipping completely taking me out of the immersion. Last but not least the story is unforgivably short took me less than 5 days to complete again $70 I would expect those hours of playing to be worth the money but to me, it falls short, yeah there are sides missions, and activities but they feel boring after a while since it\\u2019s the same thing over and over.\\n\\nI would wait for a sale if you\\u2019re looking to buy the game.\\n\\n4.3 out of 5 - Good \\ud83d\\udc4f\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"I might be biased as a Spider-Man fan since the age of 4. Which was 1982, and this game is pure superhero power fantasy excellence. I am having so much fun swinging and flying through NYC. It\\u2019s fast, smooth and slick. The same with the combat. Insomniac has really captured what you think it would feel like to be one of the Spider-Men.\\n\\nThe #1 pro for this game is the story. It is the best Spider-Man story that Marvel Comics refuses to tell. Specifically, it does what the comics won\\u2019t, and it allows Peter to grow up. It\\u2019s what the fans have mostly wanted to see with the character for years now, instead of the state of arrested development that Marvel seems to have wanted to keep him in over the past 20 years. It has solid character development, and rewards you for having played the two previous games. While Peter and Miles are Spider-Man, they are their own characters, with their own backgrounds that makes them who they are. It\\u2019s what makes this game the perfect package of great gameplay, great graphics and a great story.\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"Great game. Awesome sequel.\\n\\nAbout as long as the original Spider-Man. Playing as both Peter and Miles is so sick. There's like a million different costumes. The fast travel in this game is some sorcery.\\n\\nBoss battles are the best in the series. Game gets a little tough. I'd say upgrade your health and damage abilities early. I got a buncha costumes and kinda regretted it later.\\ud83d\\ude23\\n\\nStory is solid, much like the first game. Kraven and, later, Venom make for standout villains. The biggest turn being Peter in the symbiote suit. Reminds me of the Otto/Peter dynamic.\\n\\nOnly real problems being launch day glitches. Those can solved in a patch. Also, if you don't feel like paying full price, don't. There is no shame in waiting for a price drop. 5/5\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"I was really looking forward to this game, and for the most part I got the improved gameplay I was hoping for. There are added traversal options for web swinging, and you also have web \\\"wings\\\" that let you glide all over both boroughs. You'll find yourself zipping all over the city much faster than in either the first Spider-Man, or Spider-Man: Miles Morales.\\n\\nYou can also unlock Fast Travel as before, and it is MUCH faster. No more subway cut scenes. Once you've unlocked the option for that area, pick it on the map and you're there in a few seconds, mid swing or glide.\\n\\nThe game looks amazing either in Fidelity or Performance mode. In both ray tracing is present, though of course done better in Fidelity mode.\\n\\nYou play as both Peter and Miles. Most of their supporting casts are back and I like all of those characters for the most part.\\n\\nThe one character I sometimes don't like is MJ. Most people didn't want to play as her again and instead of listening to that, Insomniac chose to give us more missions as her. They did try to make them more action oriented, but for me they came across as bit too unbelievable even for a superhero game. I was disappointed with them.\\n\\nI also felt that the writers went out of their way to malign Peter Parker, partly to help prop up Miles, which wasn't necessary. Miles is already fine on his own, he didn't need them to tear down Peter. We also have Peter doubting himself, diminishing himself at times. Once you pick up on this it tends to stick out. It's especially bad during one of the last missions. There's some dialogue that just made me shake my head.\\n\\nThere are some side missions that people have been complaining about.\\n\\nThe one mission with Miles' girlfriend, I didn't think it was so bad. It slowed the game down a bit and probably should have been optional, but I wasn't put off by it.\\n\\nThere were other missions and certain imagery that annoyed a lot of people. I don't think I should get into those here, though.\\n\\nI unlocked the platinum trophy in about 36 hours, and for much of that time I did not use Fast Travel, and I did some goofing off and messing around, not focusing on anything specific. If you're just looking to do the story, you're looking at maybe 12-15 hours, and that's being generous.\\n\\nYou don't need to play on Ultimate difficulty to get trophies or anything. You beat the game, and get the option to play on Ultimate for seemingly nothing other than the challenge.\\n\\nI enjoyed this game overall, but I worry a bit about what they will do with Peter Parker in the next game. The Wolverine game will also take place in this universe, and I worry that Insomniac is veering off course and we may get a Logan that is somewhat neutered as they prop up maybe Laura(X-23), or some other character. I hope I'm wrong. I hope they do Wolverine justice and stay focused on him and his journey, and I hope it's a violent one with nothing held back.\\n\\nIf you haven't picked up this game yet, you may want to wait for a sale. At $70, it might not be worth it to you. You'll have fun, but you'll probably put it down a lot sooner than you're expecting.\",\n",
            "        \"10\": \"I really enjoyed this game, yet after 100% completing the game I never felt an urge to replay it or try something within it. The story is surprisingly well-executed for what could have been messy and quite clich\\u00e9/done before. The web-swinging is leaps and bounds ahead of what it was... but, it will never quite match up to Web of Shadows for me, which had the complexity and moveset to just... you would never get bored swinging, there were always new things to try, and well, unlike turning off the swing assist in this game, it didn't feel arbitrary. I also like that it used actual pendulum physics (yes you can now do 360's swinging with a skill but it's not the same). Anyway, that aside, combat is... sigh. I feel like although some of the combat, like the L1 moves are refreshing, I find it stupid that they removed the old gadget wheel. Guys, just add the new stuff with the old stuff. Minor thing but I feel like they also nerfed the perfect dodge mechanic that would give you immediate takedowns. These might sound like minor things but they made the combat feel like annoying slogfests instead of graceful encounters where you can dispatch enemies far more quickly. I also will miss the double-takedown-per-focus-bar skill. This is a \\\"harder\\\" game than the titles before, especially if you play on hard mode, but again, I think a lot of it comes down to the features they removed instead of enemies or mechanics they added. Also, definitely not a big fan of the parry feature, like it's fine but it just doesn't belong in a Spider-Man title I feel like. Final words, you will probably enjoy this game, I know I sure did. I think 70 bucks for a game is overpriced but it's more up to you whether it's worth to wait for a sale or not. I will just say that my favorite game from Insomniac is still Sunset Overdrive and I don't think that'll change anytime soon with the corporate way they've gone.\"\n",

            "        \"1\": \"I recently purchased the Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller, and it has completely changed my gaming experience. As someone who loves playing games on the Nintendo Switch, I've always been a fan of the Joy-Con controllers that come with the console, but I found them to be a bit too small and cramped for extended gaming sessions. That's where the Switch Pro Controller comes in.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed about the controller was how comfortable it is to hold. The grip is smooth and ergonomic, and the buttons are placed in a way that makes them easy to access without feeling like you're reaching too far. The controller also has a good weight to it, making it feel substantial in your hands without being too heavy.\\n\\nOne of the standout features of the Switch Pro Controller is its battery life. I've used it for hours on end without needing to charge it, which is a huge improvement over the Joy-Con controllers. And when it does need to be charged, it only takes a couple of hours to get back to full power.\\n\\nThe controller is also incredibly responsive, with no noticeable input lag. The buttons and joysticks have a great feel to them, and I've found that it's made a big difference in my gameplay. I'm able to be more precise with my movements and actions, which has helped me improve in games where accuracy is key.\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller to anyone who spends a lot of time gaming on the Switch. It's a game-changer that will improve your experience and make your gaming sessions more comfortable and enjoyable.\",\n",

            "        \"3\": \"This controller is a definite must-have for a switch owner. Especially for people who have problems with the switch Joy-Cons. It's comfortable in the hands, the response times are excellent, the analog sticks are far better quality, and everything overall is far better than what you get out of the Joy-Cons. Not a single thing I dislike about it so far.\",\n",

It's a joy to press them\\n\\nI am hoping to get some money to buy another one soon :)\",\n",

I haven\\u2019t experienced drift with this controller. It\\u2019s nice to hold in your hand. It has a long battery life. It is overall a good controller and would recommend it to any casual gamer.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"*UPDATE*\\n\\nAfter a day with the controller, I decided to call Nintendo's customer support. They ran me through the typical home diagnostics (update system/controllers, perform \\\"input test\\\") and then recommended I send in the controller for repair. So I sent it in.\\n\\nWithin a couple weeks, I was opening the box they sent back, and the receipt said \\\"Service Performed: Product Replacement\\\". So I guess they just gave me a newer controller? (10 years ago I sent in a Wii, and they returned a replacement Wii, so I guess that's just how they often do it.)\\n\\nI loaded Puyo Puyo Tetris and tried out the controller in Tetris, and the dpad seemed to worked flawlessly. After playing some actual games, I feel like there is still some odd sensitivity that causes me to mess up a direction sometimes, but not like it did before. I will probably still play Puyo Puyo with the JoyCons.\\n\\nI'll leave my rating of the product at 4 stars, since it should have worked that well in the first place, but I am now very happy with my controller.\\nI might want another one someday though, so hopefully this doesn't have to happen again.\\n\\n*END UPDATE*\\n\\nAfter reading about how the corded controllers tend to have 0-2 frames of input lag, and knowing that I'd rather not play most games with the joycons, I decided to get a pro controller along with my new Switch.\\n\\nNow, the only game I've played is Puyo Puyo Tetris, so I haven't really tested all the functionality of the controller (I'll play Super Mario Odyssey soon though), so I'm not sure about the quality of the control sticks or how well the trigger buttons work yet. But here is what I know:\\n\\nPros\\nLooks really sleek ( I only see two screws; phillips head)\\nCharging cable plugs into top of controller\\nTriggers/bumpers have a bit more resistance than the Wii U gamepad bumpers, which were definitely too easy to press\\nButtons are all pretty big, including dpad\\nSmaller buttons (Plus, Minus, Home, and screenshot) are conveniently located within thumb reach\\nEvery part of it feels good to touch\\n\\nCons\\nCharging cable is USB, but only seems to work if plugged into the switch dock's USB port\\nUp on the dpad is too easy to press\\n\\nSo that last point is really upsetting; in Puyo Puyo Tetris, you need to press dpad up a lot to instantly drop tetris blocks, but there is a high chance I will drop them accidentally whenever I press left or right on the dpad. Dpad down has significantly more resistance and I will never accidentally press that. For many games this might not be an issue, but I honestly think I'll have to use joycons for Puyo Puyo Tetris. It's not horrible, but I should be able to use this controller well for any game, so there's no way I can give it five stars.\\n\\nI will also note that I prefer to grip gamecube controllers with two fingers up on each hand (i.e. one each for L, R, ZL, and ZR), but this controller seems a bit less comfortable that way, probably because your middle fingers have less leverage, since the trigger buttons are smaller and not curved. However, the buttons are positioned such that having only one finger for two buttons is quite natural (more so than with joycons). Using only your index fingers is probably more ergonomic anyways.\\n\\nOverall I really like this controller. I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I've played Super Smash Bros. Melee competitively for a long time (which means I've gone through a lot of gamecube controllers, and often cleaned them/fixed them myself), and this controller feels like high quality hardware. I'm just really disappointed about the dpad up button being to easy to depress. Maybe other people/pro controllers don't have this problem, but it seems like something that shouldn't have been overlooked.\",\n",

            "        \"2\": \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the US Version is an absolute gaming masterpiece that lives up to its title as the \\\"ultimate\\\" fighting game. This game brings together an extensive roster of iconic characters from various video game franchises, creating a thrilling and action-packed gaming experience like no other.\\n\\nThe gameplay is fast-paced, fluid, and incredibly fun. Each character has a unique set of moves and abilities, allowing for diverse and strategic battles. Whether playing with friends locally or challenging opponents online, the game offers endless hours of entertainment and competition.\\n\\nThe attention to detail in the game is remarkable, from the meticulously designed stages inspired by classic video games to the faithfully recreated character models and animations. The visuals are crisp and vibrant, adding to the immersive gaming experience.\\n\\nThe game's sound design is exceptional, with a dynamic soundtrack that features remixes of iconic video game tunes. The audio enhances the excitement of battles and nostalgia for fans of the various franchises represented.\\n\\nOne of the most significant strengths of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is its replay value. The game's single-player modes, online multiplayer battles, and numerous unlockable characters and spirits ensure that players will keep coming back for more.\",\n",

Fighting might happen in real life if one person just wrecks everyone else. Emotions will get tested, tears possible, friendships might get ruined, but it is all worth it if you win the battle! You need ppl around you to sharpen your skills.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"Nintendo once again does not disappoint! This one is just as fun and addicting as the last one, but with every character from every Smash Bros game that came before, this one upset the stakes. Fantastic game! Definitely one of the best ever made! Certainly the best Smash game in my opinion.\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Pros:\\nThe World of Light adventure mode is fantastic. Not only is it really fun to play with the addition of a progression system with the spirits, skill tree, and unlocking more fighters, but it also quite long and will take you many hours to fully play through. I actually quite enjoyed the spirit system and the many different spirit fights seem diverse enough that it doesn't really start to bore me. Maybe the only problem is the varied difficulty of fights. Most fights are insanely easy after you have a decent full leveled spirit, even on the highest difficulty, but you can always purposefully handicap yourself by using a weaker spirit if that's your thing. But also some of the fights were so insanely difficult and unfair that switching down to \\\"easy\\\" mode still made the fight take me 30 minutes of replaying to beat (and I'm pretty decent at the game). Honestly it wasn't even a downside for me I enjoyed the challenge and it wasn't a necessary fight for progressing.\\nHuge character pool this time around. \\\"Everyone is here!\\\" Not an exaggeration over 80 characters will be on the roster after dlc and counting Pokemon trainer as multiple fighters. Obviously some of those are just slightly different echo fighters, but the diversity is still great. Just quick unlocking characters by restarting, unlocking, and restarting again took a long time. All the characters look great and feel great to play and play vs, though I haven't been able to use all of the extensively yet.\\nI'm not a pro player by any stretch, but the fighting mechanics feel fluid and the engine seems well polished. I love that the heavy characters have been buffed by having their lag time for aerials and landing reduced. I like them making perfect shield harder/different as it will give pros something to develop skill wise as well. Hopefully the pro scene will be able to make something of this game as smash 4 was a bit of a let down (won't even talk about brawl).\\nThey also made training mode better, and allow you to play the game while waiting for an online match, but many other parts of online are less than desirable.\\n\\nCons:\\nOnline mode is kind of taking a back seat here. I was really hoping we would be getting a more fine tuned and more competition oriented online mode, but got the opposite. They made online mode a for fun system, which I understand is the direction Sakurai wants to take with the game, but I just don't understand why they couldn't have given their competitive community a bone here. Online match making no longer has a For Glory mode. There is simply casual mode with a matchmaking system that puts you up against someone near your skill level based on an elo system on a per fighter basis. It also matches you with some with a game rule similar to your own, but not exact.... this has made me go into what I thought was a 1v1 no items match into an assist trophy free for all nightmare. This is also going to continue to create debates as to what the \\\"official\\\" competitive rule set will be for 1v1 online play.\\n\\nOverall the game is a great experience and was definitely worth the purchase and worth the wait. Tons of replayablity and fun for all levels of players.\",\n",
            "        \"6\": \"Definitely my favorite Smash Bros entry of the entire series. One could even say it's the \\\"Ultimate\\\" version of the game. It can be played for hours with friends and I've even enjoyed playing on my own, though that isn't quite as fun as playing with a group of friends and family.\\n\\nI will admit it can be a confusing game to jump right in to if you've never played a Smash Bros game before. However, it can be enjoyed by little kids and adults alike. Make sure to watch the \\\"How to Play\\\" video after the intro to the game to get a basic idea of how the game works. These games have a pretty unique take on the fighting game genre, so I'll leave a basic summary below.\\n\\nThe goal is to knock your opponents off the edge of the screen to reduce their lives. As you hit your opponent their percentage goes up. The higher that percentage is, the farther they will fly away when attacked. When a character is knocked out, they come back at 0% and continue battling until time runs out or they run out of stock/lives.\\n\\nEach character (there are 74!) has different kinds of moves, strengths, and weaknesses. There are multiple items, modes, and stages/levels in the game. The best way to learn it all is just to play. You'll quickly find characters you enjoy playing as and develop a fighting style that's all your own.\\n\\nI realize I haven't said much about the game yet, but there is so much going for it that it's hard to pick things out. The music, sheer number of stages and characters, and overall polish to the game is astounding. In terms of changes between previous versions of the game, some of my favorite things are:\\n\\n1) The physics of the game are the best so far. Its crisp, fast paced, and not as floaty as Brawl. Knocking people away, trying to get back to the stage, and performing combos just feels so fluid.\\n2) Setting custom rulesets. I have my default 3 stock no items for 1 on 1 or true skill matches. I have a 3 stock all items high and smash meter on for the free for all party play. You can set the rules up whatever way you like and set a preset which makes getting in to play that much faster.\\n3) Starting with the original 8 characters and unlocking all the new ones is actually really fun for me and never felt like a chore. Anyone complaining about this part must not remember what it was like to get Mewtwo (20 hours of vs matches) or Game and Watch (1000 vs matches) in Melee or Wolf in Brawl (450 matches). In this mode you get the chance to beat and unlock a challenger every 10 minutes of VS play, or even quicker if you reset the switch after every match. You also face a challenger every time you finish classic mode, or throughout the new Spirits mode in World of Light. It really is fun to watch the roster grow, and doesn't really feel all that grindy unless you are in a huge rush to unlock every one. If there is a character you really want, look up the charts that show you who unlocks who in Classic mode and you can have the character you want within 30 minutes easy.\\n4) Slow-mo on knockout hits, extra damage in 1v1, the overlaid out of bounds box when someone went flying, and the smoke trailing characters matching their color are all huge quality of life improvements.\\n5) Everything? I could go on and on. I love this game. Within a night of playing it was without a doubt my favorite game of the series.\",\n",
            "        \"7\": \"Arguably, sometimes when it comes to gems for the Nintendo Switch, I sometimes head backwards & give them a chance rather than playing them at the moment. Arguably, I have been more of a light fan of the Super Smash Brothers series than a hard core one. I have played prior Super Smash Brothers games with the arcade fighting fun against the great foes like Master Hand & more updated characters like Ganondorf & Mega Man. Arguably, trying to head back into the franchise is definitely a challenge, but had some things that worked well, where others could've worked better. After finally getting to play Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate, I can finally say this is one of the best multiplayer games to master.\\n\\nSuper Smash Brothers: Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch is one of the best multiplayer experiences you can get, right behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. You have a lengthy amount of content here, where you match & play against as many as 80 characters like Sonic The Hedgehog, Kirby, Luigi, Mario & Wario. This game has a lot of great matches that you can play & stages that celebrate video games' past like Green Hill Zone from Sonic The Hedgehog, the Metroid underworld, where you're battling with Mother Brain in the background. There are many different multiplayer fights with 100 smash battle & custom traditional fighting arcade modes for each character in the arcade mode.\\n\\nBut where the game does shine, but truthfully shines too bright is the World Of Light adventure mode. Where you start as Kirby & he has to travel to unlock multiple fighters as you play the game to try & challenge the dark & light worlds where he can match against classic Smash Brothers foes like Crazy Hand, Giga Bowser & forgotten Nintendo enemies like Mark from the Kirby franchise & Dracula from the Castlevania franchise. The story feels kind of lightweight, where the content is good. I have found the game is fun, but could've been simplified in the end. Sometimes, navigating through the spirit trails can be frustrating & feels more like a exhaustion rather than a strength. But for easier gamers, you can simply tone down the difficulty to make your run though a bit easier. Graphically, the game looks great & has strong music to enjoy, but the control is easy to maintain, but can simply vary during challenges you play within the adventure mode. Still, multiplayer makes the control customizable & easier to maintain.\\n\\nThere are a few disadvantages with the game though. One of them happens to be the Word Of Light. The world looks great, but it doesn't feel as cinematic as prior Super Smash Brothers titles. I actually thought the subspace embessary from Super Smash Brothers: Brawl was a bit more engaging & compelling to play. Another disadvantage is in the level changer where you add fog, swap gravity & add partner foes to help win matches is honestly tedious & can change the matches drastically. When I found out that the stage made a flip upside down to the point that I had to perform the fight in a mirror style by making my controller go left, so I could make the fighter head right to where I could win a match. Arguably, it was very exhausting & caused me to feel drained in the end.\\n\\nWhether you have played Super Smash Brothers in the past, or other fighting games like Street Fighter V, there is a lot to play & have fun with while playing Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate. It is a great game, but more of a circus for excitement with matches with friends & contests. The single player adventure mode is a challenge that does work, but can quite easily drive you down rather than lift you up overall. Still, it is a step up from the failure of the Smash Brothers game on Wii U. So get yourself revved up out of your corner & fight.\\n\\nGraphics: B+\\n\\nSound: B 1/2+\\n\\nControl: B\\n\\nFun & Enjoyment: B- for solo play; B+ for multiplayer\\n\\nOverall: B 1/2+\",\n",
            "        \"8\": \"This is the classic super fun Mario game. The whole family loves it. Highly recommend.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"Let me begin by saying Super Smash Bros. has always been a fighting game franchise I've held dear since my childhood. Each new entry seemed to completely raise the bar, thereby raising my expectations for what kind of surprises were in store for us. And as far as the character reveals go, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate boasted a good amount of surprises for the fans. Lots of heavily requested fighters such as King K. Rool, Ridley and Simon Belmont finally graced the roster. However, I just don't see how they can call this the \\\"Ultimate\\\" version of Smash when so much was taken out in exchange for a larger than normal stage and fighter number. So this brings me to the ultimate question (sorry for the overuse of the word \\\"ultimate\\\" btw). Was what we gained better than what we lost? That's a difficult question for me to answer. Instead, I'll just spill my thoughts. Let's continue with the review.\\n\\nPart 1: Presentation. The formula of Super Smash Bros has remained relatively the same since its debut in 1999. Its control scheme is pretty unique for a fighting game. But, it works excellently. There are no 15-button combos, but a series of standard, special, and aerial attacks that can be used in whichever sequence you see fit. The objective of the game is to rack up damage on your opponents by beating them to a pulp using your wide variety of moves, items, assists etc. and then launching them off the stage. I simply adore the chaotic gameplay of Smash bros. and so do millions of people, hence the large fanbase. However, there are some people in this world who have never played a Smash game before (shocking, right?). I just feel the game could do a better job in presenting itself to newcomers. The \\\"how to play\\\" video doesn't show up until after the game's opening. How will people know to wait after the logo comes on the screen? Other than that, the menu is very clean and straightforward this time around. It only takes 3 button presses to get into a match with you and your buds. I also want to take this time and applaud the beautiful design of the menus. There is a nice mix between simplistic graphics and in-game images. It honestly deserves an award. Not only that, its easier than ever to add up to 8 players to a match, set up custom match rules and edit controller configurations. So much care went into making the experience pleasurable.\\n\\nPart 2: Gameplay. Like I mentioned above, the gameplay of Smash Bros. remained the same. But, this time around, the overall speed has been upped a bit, making the gameplay a tad faster than Smash 4, but a tad slower than Melee. And I gotta say, it really feels great. Since the speed of the game changed, so did some of the animations of the fighters. Taunts, for instance, are quicker and don't leave you vulnerable for as long. And when you launch a fighter, they propel a lot faster and a lot farther. This makes it a bit harder to execute combos, sadly. Despite the faster gameplay, I am AMAZED at how fluid the movements of the fighters still are, as well as how nicely animated some of their new moves are. This game runs at a buttery-smooth 60 fps, despite all the chaos happening on the screen. I'd give this game an A+ in this department. It's not hard to understand why the gameplay of Smash hasn't changed. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\n\\nPart 3: Content. This is where things get dicey. One could argue that having 70+ characters and 100+ stage options qualifies as a hefty amount of content. However,a lot-and I mean ALOT of the features/modes from the prior smash bros. games have been cut. I'm going to start by telling you what you get with this game. There is your standard \\\"Smash\\\" mode, which houses local multiplayer matches. Standard Smash is for 2-8 players. If you have an even larger group of people wanting to play, you'll be glad to know there's a tournament mode. A new multiplayer mode called \\\"squad strike\\\" makes its debut in this game. In this mode, you can challenge a buddy and both of you use a \\\"squad\\\" of 3 or 5 characters to participate in elimination-style matches. Other than that, you can also mess around with the rules in the multiplayer matches. The mode \\\"special\\\" smash makes a return. Playing this mode, will allow you to fight with a variety of battle parameters (make your fighter faint after taking a certain amount of damage, make your fighters large, make them metallic, etc). Next, we have \\\"Spirits mode\\\", which houses this game's campaign mode, \\\"World of Light\\\". This could take a while to wrap up, so i'll try to be brief. Those of you who are familiar with Smash Bros may remember collecting \\\"trophies\\\" which are in-game collectible 3D models of characters who are both in and not in the game. In prior games, there were tons of ways you could unlock trophies, which added hours upon hours of more content. In this game, trophies are gone, but their spirits are carried through...well, spirits. The whole gimmick of \\\"Spirits mode\\\" is fighting,collecting and leveling up spirits, which are obtained by completing matches with a plethora of wacky parameters. So, what are spirits? They're basically the souls of characters who appeared in various games. In this game, they're represented by flat 2D images, rather than 3D models like the trophies were. When you \\\"equip\\\" a spirit, you attain its powers, which in some way, are related to the spirit itself. In super smash bros. brawl for wii, you may remember \\\"stickers\\\", which are almost the exact same thing, but you can't level them up. The whole mechanic of \\\"spirits\\\" is fully brought into play in the \\\"World of Light\\\" campaign mode. This time around, a new foe named \\\"Galeem\\\" has reared his ugly head and claimed the bodies of all the fighters (except Kirby) and is making clones of them. To make these clones fight, he uses the spirits he claimed from non-important characters and embeds them into the clones so that they become animate. Your job is to rescue all of your fallen comrades and restore light to the world. In this mode, you traverse a large, and I mean LARGE map, taking on the clones (with spirits inside them) in a variety of silly matches. Should you beat the clone at their own game, you free the spirit within and you can use their powers to help you free more spirits. Spirits are leveled up naturally by fighting. The better you do in a fight, the more EXP your spirit gets. Playing a good match can also net you \\\"skill points\\\" which can be used to unlock extra stats on top of the ones you get with spirits. When you travel across the map, you will run into your comrades being held captive. If you defeat them in a regular match, you will free them and that means you not only get to use then in World of Light, but in every other mode in the game as well. Each section of World of Light's map has a boss. Defeat that boss and you're one step closer to confronting Galeem. Anyway, you keep going through the cycle of fighting,rescuing spirits,rescuing fighters and taking down bosses for the whole campaign mode. I have yet to complete this mode, but it goes on for a while. My gripe with \\\"World of Light\\\" is that it becomes repetitive after a while. These matches with the crazy battle parameters make up about 90% of the campaign and are, in theory, just matches that you can replicate by messing around with the rules in \\\"Smash mode\\\". This honestly feels like event matches with an unnecessary rpg mechanic slapped on it. Also, the difficulty is all over the place. Some matches are fairly easy and in others, you'll get your can kicked to and fro. Anyhoo, let's keep going. Next, we have \\\"Classic Mode\\\", which is no stranger to us Smash fans. In this mode, you select a character, take on a series of matches and fight a boss at the end. However, this classic mode is a bit different than the \\\"classic\\\" modes we're used to. And by \\\"different\\\", I mean worse. First off, classic mode has been shortened by like 5 matches. Second, there is only one bonus game that you play between matches, and its the same for every fighter and every difficulty you choose. It's a little obstacle course where you collect yellow orbs and race to the end before a black hole swallows you. I just don't understand why they couldn't have at least added different layouts for the obstacle course. In prior games, there were \\\"break the targets\\\" bonus stages that had multiple layouts. Lastly, classic mode ends with a boss. **SPOILER ALERT IN 3...2....1...(SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED)There are only 6 bosses in the game. And in a game with over 70 characters, this means you'll be fighting the same ones over and over. And lo and behold, these are the EXACT six bosses you'll fight in the campaign mode.\\n\\n**SPOILERS OVER**Alright, next I want to cover the online mode. I knew from when it was first unveiled, it would be a mess and I was right. There is no longer the \\\"For fun\\\" and \\\"For Glory\\\" options that were in Smash Bros. for Wii U. There is only the Quickplay option in which you set your match preferences and HOPE you and another player have the same idea of a good match. More often than not, you will be forced to play in 4-player matches if you don't want to play 4-player matches and 1-on-1 matches when you don't feel like playing a 1-on-1. Also, there is noticeable lag (Oh boy, what a surprise) when playing online. Apparently, the game does its best to set you up against players close to you, but if one player has bad internet, everyone suffers.\\n\\nPart 4(UPDATED AS OF AUGUST 2019):The Cutting Board. This is where I want to talk about features than many considered to be standard for Smash games, but for some reason, don't show up in Ultimate. My main problem with this game is that I feel Nintendo stripped the extra content and modes that made Smash Bros. a truly enjoyable experience, leaving behind what the game is at its core: a party fighting game. Nintendo seems to be on this trend lately with games like Mario Tennis Aces, ARMS, Star Fox Zero and Mario Kart 8, where modes that offered a great subsidiary to the main gameplay formula (multiplayer modes, mini game modes, battle modes etc) that were present in PAST TITLES are nowhere to be seen. And I absolutely HATE that Smash had to be a part of this trend. And this most disappointing part of this is that the Switch is Nintendo's 2nd HD game console. We should be getting games that absolutely push the boundaries of what past games were restricted to. Other developers are making their sequels bigger and better, but for some reason, Nintendo is holding back content from their games. It just doesn't make sense. It's as if whenever they take 1 step forward, they have to take 2 steps back. Sorry for the small rant, here are the features that Smash Ultimate lacks. First, mini-games like \\\"Break the Targets\\\", \\\"board the platforms\\\" and \\\"Home run contest\\\" are absent. I feel these games would have been PERFECT for an online leader board functionality. Second, Single player modes like \\\"All-star\\\" and \\\"event match\\\" are absent.\\nUPDATE: Stage Builder mode, which was a feature of the last 2 Smash games, was added via an update and it's amazing how much care went into designing the new components and objects you can play around with. This stage builder easily trumps the other two. Not only that, Tournament mode was added. I' ve decided to bump up my rating by one star to accommodate these additions. Thanks for listening to the fans, Mr. Sakurai.\\n\\nLastly, I want to talk about unlocking methods. You start the game with the original 8 characters that you started with in the Nintendo 64 game, yet all of the stages are unlocked. This baffling to me. In prior smash games, you would have to unlock stages and characters by completing certain requirements. Some of which were very unique and creative, making unlocking the character/stage a truly rewarding experience. With Ultimate, all of that is gone. You simply unlock characters by playing multiplayer matches, classic mode matches or via the \\\"World of Light\\\" campaign. If you want to bring back the nostalgic feel of putting effort towards unlocking something, you need to do it with the stages as well.\\n\\nPart 5: The verdict: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a truly great game at its core. Its gameplay has even been tweaked and refined, further enhancing the experience. However, most of what you'll be doing in this game is playing standard matches, whether it be against a CPU or a few buddies. Many of us were looking forward to a fully fleshed-out adventure mode, but its basically a series of event matches-something we've seen before. And all of the great passtimes like home-run batting, trophy collecting,\\\"break the targets\\\" or stage building are nowhere to be seen. And the one mode we do have that was present in past games, \\\"Classic\\\" mode has been watered down. By no means am I saying this is a terrible game. It's just that I was expected what added to the charm of Smash Bros. to be included in this installment. And I'm very well sure the developers know that we sometimes can't get everything we want. I don't feel ripped off, because there is very well $60 worth of content in this game. And with the addition of fan favorite characters like Banjo-Kazooie coming soon, I am very grateful to the dedication of the development team. Thanks for reading and happy gaming.\",\n",

            "        \"1\": \"UPDATE: These wireless headphones are working much better now with a more recent update. I was experiencing frequent but very brief audio dropouts before the update, but it seems like the latest update has addressed this issue. If you are experiencing any audio issues, try updating the headset using the Xbox accessories app on your console.\\n\\nThe headset has experienced little to no issues since the update, and I'm very pleased with how they function, how they sound, and how they feel to wear.\\n\\nOriginal review follows:\\nI bought these because I got tired of using my CloudX Flight headset dongle. I liked that these connect directly to the console like a controller. Comparing these to the CloudX, the sound is so much better. There's serious bass to this thing, unlike the CloudX which sounds weak and flabby in the low end. It also feels sturdier. I love the convenience of connecting it without a dongle. As for fit, I liked the CloudX much more. This one is very tight on my head, but fortunately the ear cups are soft. It doesn't shift around on my head like the CloudX does, so I guess that's the trade-off. But there is one serious flaw that I can't seem to get around. The audio drops out intermittently. After around 15-20 minutes of use, the audio will start to drop out for a very brief moment, around a fraction of a second. This occurs about once a minute, and it grows to be very, very annoying and tiresome quickly. I use these for online gaming, and having my friend's voices or game audio drop out this frequently is driving me nuts. I'm sitting about 7 feet from the console with direct line of sight, nothing blocking the signal from my console to my headphones. The router isn't nearby, either, so I don't know what could be causing it. Turning it off and back on doesn't help either. The only solution is to turn the headset and console off and back on, which fixes the problem for about 15 minutes, then it's back to the frequent audio drops.\\n\\nI love everything else about this headset, but the annoying audio drops are really ruining an otherwise great product. If I find a solution, I will update this review.\",\n",
            "        \"2\": \"So, I've been using the Xbox Wireless Headset, and I've got some thoughts to share.\\n\\nFirst off, the sound quality is quite impressive. The audio is clear and really adds depth to my gaming experience. The spatial audio feature is a neat touch, helping me better locate in-game sounds and giving me an edge in competitive play.\\n\\nComfort is a big deal for me during long gaming sessions, and this headset delivers. The ear cups are well-padded, and I can wear it for hours without discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a snug fit.\\n\\nWireless connectivity is seamless, and the battery life is reliable, meaning it doesn't conk out in the middle of an epic gaming session.\\n\\nThe microphone quality is good too, offering clear communication with my gaming buddies.\\n\\nAll in all, the Xbox Wireless Headset is a solid addition to my gaming setup. It combines excellent sound quality, comfort, and reliable wireless performance. I'd definitely recommend it to fellow gamers.\",\n",
            "        \"3\": \"These are about as good as it gets for a sub $100 headset.\\n\\nSolid build, comfortable, good enough audio, and all kinds of slick features like adjusting volume with the outer earcups.\\n\\nOne of the cool features that some may not known about, is that you can have these connected to your Xbox and another Bluetooth device at the same time. So you can still get in-game audio while being able to listen to podcasts from your phone. This was honestly huge for me. On PC I love to listen to podcasts or random YouTube channels while I play. So at first I was kind of bummed that I wasn't really able to do that on Xbox. But these make it possible.\",\n",
            "        \"4\": \"PROS:\\n\\n* Bass-heavy out of the box, but after a few equalizer tweaks sound is loud and clear\\n* Easily syncs with your Xbox, Windows, PC, and even your phone!\\n* Can power your Xbox on and off from the headset\\n* Volume, chat, and game audio are easily controlled by turning the left and right ear pieces, making them really easy and fast tk adjust during gameplay\\n* Comfortable and fits snugly\\n* GAME CHANGER: allows simultaneous syncing with your phone and Xbox! Can automatically reduce game and chat audio for an incoming call\\n* USB-C charging\\n*\\n\\nCONS:\\n* Sound is garbage out of the box. Too bass heavy, almost unusable\\n* Indicator light is on the mouthpiece, which cannot be seen while wearing, difficult to tell headphone status based on a light that cannot be seen unless you take off the headset\\n* Ear foams can get uncomfortably warm from body heat after extended gameplay\\n* Charging port is a little difficult to find, should be in a more convenient location\\n\\nFirst headset I purchased that I\\u2019ve been completely satisfied with. Sound and features far better than Turtle Beach products in the same price range. Really hope they last\\u2026\",\n",
            "        \"5\": \"Admittedly, I went with another brand first due to its price point and review ratings. That other brand connected just fine with my Xbox One X but no audio came out of the headset. I tried changing settings on the TV and console, did research online, but still unsuccessful. So, I returned it. I bought the actual Xbox brand headset at just around $10 more. I charged it overnight and then connected it the next day. It too a little longer than expected for the headset to pair with the console but it eventually did. As soon as it was connected, I could hear the headset produce audio as it is intended to do. I've been using it for several days now and have been extremely happy with its fit an function. If you are an audiophile that holds electronics at a high standard, this may not meet your expectations. However for me and most other gamers, the sound quality is very good and the bass is more than sufficient. I like that you can control the volume by turning the side of the headset. You can also control the chat/game fader the same way. Why is this a big deal? Because you don't have to fumble with trying to locate the volume buttons due to the dials being the entire side of the headset. It's hard to mess up.\\n\\nI hope this review helps other gamers out there looking for an affordable and more than adequate headset that can be connected to not only your Xbox, but your phone and other devices.\",\n",

            "        \"8\": \"I have been using this headset for the last couple of months, everything came fine when I bought it, and so far I really like the experience with it, the battery holds up some hours, nothing mind-blowing but it's also really easy to charge with the front USB port of the Xbox (you can change this with the Xbox turn off)\\n\\nThe sound is great, it has a heavy base and you can configure everything as you would like on the headset configuration page on your Xbox (These settings are stored in the headset itself, so using it on a PC or Phone will have the changes)\\n\\nI mostly use this for when I'm going to play with friends, the mic sounds perfect and you don't need to move the thing to be able to catch your voice, I also noticed it's very directional, so if I'm seen a video on my phone, with a reasonable distance from the mic it doesn't catch any sound away from my voice, which is really cool.\\n\\nThe only issue I have with this headset is that it's kind of uncomfortable with prolonged gaming sessions if you use glasses, I think that it's more like an issue with my glasses than the proper headset, my glasses have like a curve, they are not 100% straight with the sides of my head and I think that adds pressure, so yeah, after using this for a while I start to feel some discomfort/pain on the sides of the head. I will say it happens after 2-3 hours so nothing that bad, but it happens.\\n\\nI'm still happy with the product, I easily recommend this as a good companion for your Xbox.\",\n",
            "        \"9\": \"So, I'm not an avid gamer by any means. I recently got an Xbox Series S and it came with the wired headset, but I kept getting the wire all wrapped around my hand or I would pull it out while trying to put my controller down and go into the other room. It got very annoying very fast. I did research on headsets for a couple weeks. I didn't want to spend unnecessary money on an expensive pair that I wasn't actually happy with or had features I really didn't need.\\n\\nThe main features I was looking for in a headset were: wireless, simultaneous Bluetooth and mic monitoring. Nothing fancy at all. I have to say it was incredibly hard to find more than a few headsets that had simultaneous Bluetooth connection so that I could listen to music or take phone calls while I was also gaming and hearing the audio from that. When I saw these did it, I was really excited and thought it was a better option than shelling out more money for some higher tier headsets like the SS Arctis 9X or TBs. I read too many mixed reviews about those, where the negatives were just too worrisome for me to really consider getting them. I did see mixed reviews for these, but I took the risk since they are not as expensive and I figured I'll just try to be extra gentle when handling them.\\n\\nSo far, these are definitely what I needed and wanted! The simultaneous Bluetooth is a huge win for me. A friend of mine doesn't have a headset, so we just talk on a phone call while we game, but I'm absolutely still able to hear the audio from whatever game I'm playing. There's also an in-game chat mixer built in, just rotate the outer part of the left ear cup to adjust as needed. Volume adjusting is the right side ear cup.\\n\\nThe ear cups feel very comfortable. It's some type of memory foam. I haven't noticed any sort of discomfort unless I play for 6+ hours straight and that happens rarely and I really only think that's due to the fact that I wear glasses. The head band also is comfortable for the most part. I would say that I do start to notice a bit of discomfort after a few hours. I don't really mind this, as I usually just slightly adjust it forward or back or my head once in a while. Not a big deal for me, though.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't really like is the placement of the microphone mute button... all the way on the back of left ear cup on the mic piece. It's not on the mic itself, but the arm of it, which also could be a bit longer in my opinion. Sometimes I worry I'm not close enough to it for it to clearly pick up my voice, but luckily the mic monitoring does help me to know how loud or quiet I am and if the other people can hear me.\\n\\nAltogether I'm very happy with these and I'll try to give an update to my review after 6+ months of use.\",\n",
